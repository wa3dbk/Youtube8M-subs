00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
okay I'm going to tie a double

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.980 
okay I'm going to tie a double
half-hitch<00:00:01.589> knot<00:00:02.629> I<00:00:03.629> go<00:00:04.620> over<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.190> string

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
half-hitch knot I go over the string

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.750 
half-hitch knot I go over the string
under<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.170> string<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.859> back<00:00:08.220> through<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
under the string and back through the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.190 
under the string and back through the
loop<00:00:09.230> all<00:00:10.230> right<00:00:10.410> then<00:00:11.630> to<00:00:12.630> create<00:00:12.900> an

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
loop all right then to create an

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.680 
loop all right then to create an
opposing<00:00:13.889> not<00:00:14.130> I've<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.059> under<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
opposing not I've got to go under the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.060 
opposing not I've got to go under the
string<00:00:16.080> over<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> string<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.930> back<00:00:19.710> through

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
string over the string in back through

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.580 
string over the string in back through
the<00:00:20.220> loop<00:00:20.600> now<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:21.840> two<00:00:22.050> knots<00:00:22.320> are

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the loop now I'm not two knots are

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.880 
the loop now I'm not two knots are
opposing<00:00:22.980> each<00:00:23.340> other<00:00:24.650> okay<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.970> tighten<00:00:27.390> this

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
opposing each other okay to tighten this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
opposing each other okay to tighten this
knot<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> pair<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
knot up I'm going to use a pair of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.950 
knot up I'm going to use a pair of
starting<00:00:31.410> clamps<00:00:32.090> I'll<00:00:33.090> take<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.480> starting

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
starting clamps I'll take my starting

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.310 
starting clamps I'll take my starting
clamp<00:00:35.059> cinch<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.719> first

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
clamp cinch it up a little bit first

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.700 
clamp cinch it up a little bit first
I<00:00:37.350> pull<00:00:37.770> down<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.790> string<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.320> rock<00:00:40.379> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
I pull down the string and then rock it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
I pull down the string and then rock it
back<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:42.390> sense<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.170> uptight<00:00:44.629> okay<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
back up to sense that not uptight okay I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
back up to sense that not uptight okay I
can<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> couple<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.980> times<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
can do it a couple of times but it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.240 
can do it a couple of times but it
really<00:00:48.000> won't<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.329> any<00:00:48.600> difference

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
really won't make any difference

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
really won't make any difference
alright<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.770> want

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
alright now what I want to do is I want

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.930 
alright now what I want to do is I want
to<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.160> under<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> string<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.520> then<00:00:56.520> really

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to go under the string and then really

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.139 
to go under the string and then really
just<00:00:56.969> back<00:00:57.539> through<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> loop<00:00:58.820> okay<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just back through this loop okay and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
just back through this loop okay and
I've<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> second<00:01:01.770> half<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.550> double

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
I've got the second half of my double

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.670 
I've got the second half of my double
half-hitch

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.850 
half-hitch
now<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.400> tighten<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.470> simply

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the tighten up the nine I release my

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.060 
the tighten up the nine I release my
clamp<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.430> there's<00:01:17.430> my<00:01:17.640> double<00:01:17.970> half-hitch

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
clamp and there's my double half-hitch

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.260 
clamp and there's my double half-hitch
now<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> show<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.640> how<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> tie<00:01:21.119> up

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
now I'm going to show you how to tie up

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
now I'm going to show you how to tie up
our<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.619> Parnell<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.310> starts<00:01:23.759> off

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
our now not the Parnell not starts off

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.020 
our now not the Parnell not starts off
just<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> double<00:01:24.900> hitch<00:01:25.820> tie<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.880> knot

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
just like the double hitch tie my knot

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.179 
just like the double hitch tie my knot
and<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:30.689> under<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> same

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and then I go back under that same

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.030 
and then I go back under that same
string<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.710> loop

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
string and that up through that loop

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.719 
string and that up through that loop
where<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> tail<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.409> inside<00:01:38.100> or

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
where the tail is on the inside or

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
where the tail is on the inside or
between<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:40.320> big<00:01:40.710> loop<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> me<00:01:42.049> then<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.380> can

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
between this big loop and me then I can

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
between this big loop and me then I can
cinch<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> same<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.509> by<00:01:45.720> pulling

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
cinch it up the same way just by pulling

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.139 
cinch it up the same way just by pulling
it<00:01:46.170> tight<00:01:46.490> pulling<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> string<00:01:47.909> down

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
stitching it up tight and then pulling

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
stitching it up tight and then pulling
this<00:01:52.470> one's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.829> tight<00:01:53.100> tight

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
a pro nut I go in time out not just like

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.390 
a pro nut I go in time out not just like
I<00:02:09.539> normally<00:02:09.599> do<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.370> back

I normally do and then just go back

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.670 
I normally do and then just go back
through<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.030> loop

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
through that loop

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.410 
through that loop
just<00:02:12.859> simply<00:02:13.129> got<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> knot<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:14.000> there<00:02:14.060> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
just simply got a knot right there and

little piece of string left so what I

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.679 
little piece of string left so what I
like<00:02:51.409> to<00:02:51.470> use<00:02:51.829> is<00:02:52.129> a<00:02:52.159> starting<00:02:52.760> clamp<00:02:53.030> starting

string that I'm tying off once two times
then<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.409> can<00:03:30.590> take<00:03:30.769> those<00:03:30.889> two<00:03:31.220> loops<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.699> I

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
then I can take those two loops that I

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.420 
then I can take those two loops that I
made<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.329> take<00:03:32.510> my<00:03:32.689> tail<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.470> come<00:03:33.739> from<00:03:34.370> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
top back down through both of those

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.250 
top back down through both of those
loops<00:03:36.729> then<00:03:37.729> cinch<00:03:38.180> up<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.449> knot<00:03:38.599> from<00:03:39.079> the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
loops then cinch up the knot from the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.520 
loops then cinch up the knot from the
outside<00:03:40.180> then<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.329> can<00:03:41.540> pull<00:03:41.750> tension<00:03:42.199> on<00:03:42.349> this

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
outside then I can pull tension on this

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.399 
outside then I can pull tension on this
string<00:03:45.639> okay<00:03:46.639> once<00:03:46.909> I've<00:03:47.090> got<00:03:47.269> my<00:03:47.299> knot<00:03:47.689> tied<00:03:47.989> I

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
string okay once I've got my knot tied I

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.129 
string okay once I've got my knot tied I
can<00:03:49.159> pull<00:03:49.340> tension<00:03:49.669> on<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.689> I<00:03:50.780> don't<00:03:50.870> need

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
can pull tension on it and I don't need

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.379 
can pull tension on it and I don't need
to<00:03:51.319> hold<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.859> tail<00:03:52.159> over<00:03:52.609> here<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.090> knot

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
to hold this tail over here that knot

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.629 
to hold this tail over here that knot
itself<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:54.139> not<00:03:54.319> going<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.620> slip<00:03:54.919> and<00:03:55.220> your

work right in there so that's how I

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.870 
work right in there so that's how I
start<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:01.939> lot<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.239> my<00:04:02.389> crosses
