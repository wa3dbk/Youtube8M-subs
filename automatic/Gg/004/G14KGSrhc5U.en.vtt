upside down and place your pan on top
then<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.459> place<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> oven<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
then just place it in the oven and it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.280 
then just place it in the oven and it
won't<00:02:47.010> burn<00:02:47.390> that's<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.540> good<00:02:48.690> idea
