00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 I would like to explain the process of bedding distance using birds 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 First of all the most important thing is to put in this volume of air 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.000
 To cook with 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 The food to be cooked is five times in this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.529
 It is important to know whether the line is not fresh or fresh. 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.680
 First of all there is a food there 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:34.630
 I have measured the surface temperature of this surface meat bird to see that 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.720
 Mud guest originally 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:46.180
 There to about +10 degrees or less is the most correct the too this temperature is high and the surface 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.290
 I think that I feel as much as possible because there is a lot of breeding nowadays 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.579
 It is important to make fresh ingredients 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.899
 First, at this time we were under treatment from now 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.710
 We will disinfect with child alcohol which there is not presentation from then 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.710
 It is written in the distance 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.570
 And from now 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.920
 And surface sterilization germs are and marked with by worry also a lot in the not visible to the eye 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.390
 You are in the process of saying 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.440
 This is from now 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.730
 It is attached to the surface to put in communication in the middle of the night 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:25.600
 It will be a long time ago 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.750
 Will roughly publishes about 6 seconds from 5 seconds it is here 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 Well then 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.290
 Since it was already done 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.580
 Put on ice 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.960
 Will let us know your in from now 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.530
 First of all I want to bag 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.530
 Took out 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.509
 I drain the birds 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:49.770
 It would be nice if you could do the spice in that thing 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.770
 I think that it is preferable to put in hot water and sterilize like a bird 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.000
 And here 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.420
 Use lightly 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420
 Ryoan 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.830
 this 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.040
 I put the film 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:14.650
 I When you are also just one Pais from it 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.930
 Olive Oy This olive oil is, in fact, a very important aircraft in the sink cooking 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 is 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.829
 I want to be in the wind of ollie Boyle or I want to put in the seasoning liquid or water 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 It will be able to space the place was Kakana' of meat pork when you pack it this is the meat 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.840
 I will 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.810
 If space is created there , the heat transfer may not work 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.569
 In Therefore, even in the space that is not visible in the flesh 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:44.340
 Is fed into the oligo original intention and outside is the same as the water is transmitted guy egg water to the center temperature of the meat 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.340
 End one's says this oligo 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 Because it came from 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.480
 I will take out
