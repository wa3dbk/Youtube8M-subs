00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
what's in here now all kind of little

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
what's in here now all kind of little
Shannon<00:00:47.480> nanos<00:00:49.640> put<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.730> back<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> water

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
Shannon nanos put them back in the water

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.000 
Shannon nanos put them back in the water
so<00:00:51.890> they<00:00:52.890> don't<00:00:52.980> die<00:00:54.440> then<00:00:55.440> somebody's<00:00:55.860> got

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so they don't die then somebody's got

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.229 
so they don't die then somebody's got
their<00:00:56.129> trap<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.579> looks<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.090> may

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
their trap out here looks like they may

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.979 
their trap out here looks like they may
have<00:00:57.360> used<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.629> mouse<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.710> bait

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.780 

it's<00:01:02.469> just<00:01:02.620> an<00:01:02.770> interesting<00:01:03.190> point<00:01:03.399> of<00:01:03.640> how

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
it's just an interesting point of how

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.140 
it's just an interesting point of how
these<00:01:04.360> traps<00:01:04.839> now<00:01:05.830> whoever<00:01:06.250> holds<00:01:06.549> his<00:01:06.820> trap

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
these traps now whoever holds his trap

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.540 
these traps now whoever holds his trap
they've<00:01:08.140> got<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:10.330> good<00:01:10.540> bait<00:01:10.810> food<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.460> this

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
they've got some good bait food and this

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.370 
they've got some good bait food and this
is<00:01:12.729> he'd<00:01:13.240> get<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.479> back<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:13.810> what<00:01:13.960> there<00:01:14.110> wasn't

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
is he'd get it back in what there wasn't

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.290 
is he'd get it back in what there wasn't
that<00:01:14.409> quite<00:01:15.070> close<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.729> rope<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.180> this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
that quite close to the rope to this

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.380 
that quite close to the rope to this
culvert<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.259> we're<00:01:17.409> going<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.060> back<00:01:19.210> out

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
culvert so we're going to go it back out

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.680 
culvert so we're going to go it back out
there<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> little<00:01:19.720> bit<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.880> that's<00:01:25.149> where<00:01:25.630> it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.889 
there a little bit there that's where it
was<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.180> was<00:01:28.270> just<00:01:28.450> like<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.750> whenever

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
was and it was just like that whenever

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:29.790 
was and it was just like that whenever
we<00:01:29.080> drove<00:01:29.259> up

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
we drove up

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.210 
we drove up

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
and whenever I saw it I knew it was

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.100 
and whenever I saw it I knew it was
gonna<00:01:35.679> be<00:01:35.770> tied<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.190> something<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:37.899> tied

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110

to this tree right here which is not

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.679 
to this tree right here which is not
very<00:01:40.030> good

to<00:01:47.130> being<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> over<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:47.999> just<00:01:48.210> pull<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
to being that over and just pull the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.590 
to being that over and just pull the
string<00:01:48.929> right<00:01:49.409> off<00:01:49.819> so<00:01:50.819> what<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.359> to<00:01:51.420> do

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
string right off so what I'm going to do

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.919 
string right off so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.929> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> slide<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.740> string<00:01:53.039> down

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
is I'm going to slide the string down

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.120 
is I'm going to slide the string down
trying<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.289> sure<00:01:55.469> this<00:01:55.619> guy<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:55.950> lose

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
trying to make sure this guy don't lose

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.990 
trying to make sure this guy don't lose
his<00:01:56.310> trap

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.720 

down<00:01:59.570> here<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.870> base<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.070> tree<00:02:01.370> where<00:02:01.580> its

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
down here the base is a tree where its

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.090 
down here the base is a tree where its
strongest<00:02:02.290> there<00:02:05.530> okay<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.680> are<00:02:06.830> supposed<00:02:07.070> to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
strongest there okay we are supposed to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.560 
strongest there okay we are supposed to
get<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.280> lot<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.490> rain<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.670> die<00:02:07.880> yeah<00:02:08.240> we're

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
get a lot of rain to die yeah we're

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.820 
get a lot of rain to die yeah we're
supposed<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.869> put<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:08.990> lot<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.200> rain<00:02:09.320> tonight<00:02:09.470> so

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
supposed to put a lot of rain tonight so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.350 
supposed to put a lot of rain tonight so
slide<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.340> down<00:02:10.429> there<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.820> base<00:02:11.030> and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
slide that down there to the base and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.000 
slide that down there to the base and
maybe<00:02:11.810> loop<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.230> around<00:02:12.260> one<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.800> dogs

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
maybe loop it around one of the dogs

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.140 
maybe loop it around one of the dogs
Cypress<00:02:13.970> Knox<00:02:14.210> right<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:16.030> hopefully<00:02:17.030> he

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
Cypress Knox right here hopefully he

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.780 
Cypress Knox right here hopefully he
won't<00:02:17.240> lose<00:02:17.420> his<00:02:17.480> trap<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:19.130> just<00:02:19.340> an<00:02:19.490> example

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
won't lose his trap but just an example
