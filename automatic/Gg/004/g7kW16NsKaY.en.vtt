00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
pop shot in blind fire I haven't really

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
been pop shouting and blind firing that
much<00:02:31.930> at<00:02:32.110> all<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.769> I've<00:02:32.950> noticed<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
much at all but I've noticed that the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.690 
much at all but I've noticed that the
pop<00:02:34.120> shot<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.750> straight<00:02:35.380> as<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:36.069> like<00:02:36.430> I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
pop shot is straight as can be like I

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.820 
pop shot is straight as can be like I
pop<00:02:37.120> shot<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.080> went<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.560> where<00:02:38.769> my

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
pop shot it and it went right where my

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.309 
pop shot it and it went right where my
reticle<00:02:39.370> was<00:02:39.519> at<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:39.910> loved<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.319> blind

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
reticle was at and I loved it blind

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.259 
reticle was at and I loved it blind
fires<00:02:41.620> went<00:02:41.980> fairly<00:02:42.220> straight<00:02:42.610> as<00:02:42.760> well<00:02:42.970> and

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
fires went fairly straight as well and

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.600 
fires went fairly straight as well and
it<00:02:43.780> seems<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.500> they<00:02:44.650> used<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.069> gears<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.489> war

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
it seems like they used the gears of war

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.089 
it seems like they used the gears of war
one<00:02:45.849> blind<00:02:46.180> fire<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.599> pop<00:02:46.810> shot<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.410> that's

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
one blind fire and pop shot and that's

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.509 
one blind fire and pop shot and that's
great<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.819> added<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.330> bloom<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.890> reticle

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
great they added a bloom to the reticle

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.960 
great they added a bloom to the reticle
but<00:02:52.230> that's<00:02:53.230> always<00:02:53.709> been<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.099> gears<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.760> just
