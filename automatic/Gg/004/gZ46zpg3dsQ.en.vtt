actually come up with a whole ton of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
actually come up with a whole ton of
ideas<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.090> movies<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.540> only<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.590> best

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
ideas for movies but only the very best

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.480 
ideas for movies but only the very best
of<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.100> ever<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.939> made<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.299> films

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
of them ever get made into films

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
of them ever get made into films
sometimes<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.850> start<00:01:27.060> making<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.509> movie<00:01:27.750> but

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
sometimes we start making a movie but

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.330 
sometimes we start making a movie but
say<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> finish<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.220> whatever

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
we just don't have the right props or

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.450 
we just don't have the right props or
pieces<00:01:36.470> sometimes<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.650> impossible<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.310> make

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
