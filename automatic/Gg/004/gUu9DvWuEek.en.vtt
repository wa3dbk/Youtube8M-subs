you tilt it doesn't tilt and then a
volume<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.379> then<00:03:02.620> on<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.280> top<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:05.099> 3.5

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
volume and then on the top is 3.5

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.699 
volume and then on the top is 3.5
millimeter<00:03:06.519> jack<00:03:06.819> right<00:03:07.329> there<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
power which are going to turn on

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.309 
power which are going to turn on
hopefully<00:03:12.579> if<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.359> works<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.659> plastic<00:03:14.019> there
