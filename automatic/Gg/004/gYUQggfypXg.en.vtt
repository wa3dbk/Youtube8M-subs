anyway is basically is you you there is

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.720 
anyway is basically is you you there is
a<00:00:49.719> thing<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:50.750> spawns<00:00:51.289> in<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.589> map<00:00:51.800> it's

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
a thing that spawns in the map it's

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.549 
a thing that spawns in the map it's
called<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.059> spark<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.570> one<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.350> players

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
called a spark and one of the players

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.439 
called a spark and one of the players
will<00:00:54.949> go<00:00:55.070> pick<00:00:55.370> up<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.609> spark<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.179> then<00:00:56.359> the

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
will go pick up the spark and then the

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.810 
will go pick up the spark and then the
object<00:00:57.050> is<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.289> take<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:58.039> spark<00:00:58.370> into<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
object is to take the spark into the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.540 
object is to take the spark into the
enemy<00:00:59.179> base<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.749> blow<00:01:00.469> it<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.769> fuck<00:01:00.800> up<00:01:01.190> throw

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
enemy base and blow it the fuck up throw

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.430 
enemy base and blow it the fuck up throw
it<00:01:01.699> on<00:01:01.789> their<00:01:01.969> base<00:01:02.149> kill<00:01:02.570> everybody<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.320> then

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
it on their base kill everybody and then

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.229 
it on their base kill everybody and then
you<00:01:03.530> get<00:01:03.620> points<00:01:03.920> for<00:01:04.159> capturing<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.909> spark

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
you get points for capturing the spark

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.950 
you get points for capturing the spark
so<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.470> basic<00:01:06.830> premise<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.880> rift<00:01:08.690> I

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
so this is the basic premise of rift I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.580 
so this is the basic premise of rift I
know<00:01:09.230> other<00:01:09.590> other<00:01:10.460> games<00:01:11.270> have<00:01:11.660> done<00:01:11.930> things

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
know other other games have done things

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.350 
know other other games have done things
like<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.160> someone<00:01:13.580> says<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.880> be<00:01:14.000> like<00:01:14.150> that's

cool and I'm looking forward to it so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.970 
cool and I'm looking forward to it so
this<00:01:56.210> mode<00:01:56.510> is<00:01:56.540> definitely<00:01:57.380> something<00:01:57.800> that

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
this mode is definitely something that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.910 
this mode is definitely something that
I'm<00:01:58.520> gonna<00:01:58.730> be<00:01:58.910> playing<00:01:59.060> now<00:02:00.050> how<00:02:00.320> frequent

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'm gonna be playing now how frequent

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.630 
I'm gonna be playing now how frequent
it's<00:02:01.010> going<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.220> be<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.460> crucible

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
it's going to be in the crucible

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.360 
it's going to be in the crucible
playlist<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.450> up<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.170> air<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.560> imagine<00:02:04.220> that

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
playlist is up in the air I imagine that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.570 
playlist is up in the air I imagine that
will<00:02:04.520> see<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.970> fairly<00:02:05.720> often<00:02:06.250> hopefully<00:02:07.250> more

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
will see it fairly often hopefully more

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.160 
will see it fairly often hopefully more
than<00:02:07.790> we<00:02:07.940> see<00:02:08.149> well<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.420> guess<00:02:08.450> salvage<00:02:09.050> is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
than we see well I guess salvage is

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.259 
than we see well I guess salvage is
really<00:02:09.440> around<00:02:09.649> pretty<00:02:10.009> often<00:02:10.220> as<00:02:10.519> well<00:02:10.700> so

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
really around pretty often as well so

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.580 
really around pretty often as well so
very<00:02:12.260> cool<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.920> see<00:02:13.100> Bungie<00:02:14.350> expanding<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
very cool to see Bungie expanding the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.620 
very cool to see Bungie expanding the
crucible<00:02:15.980> universe<00:02:16.310> away<00:02:16.520> from<00:02:16.940> what<00:02:17.180> appears

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
crucible universe away from what appears

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.550 
crucible universe away from what appears
to<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.230> be

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
to just be

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.510 
to just be
II<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.480> whole<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:21.050> kill<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.800> guys<00:02:21.980> kill

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
II the the whole a kill the guys kill

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.740 
II the the whole a kill the guys kill
the<00:02:22.610> guys<00:02:22.760> though<00:02:23.000> because<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.630> an

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the guys though because you can do an

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.010 
the guys though because you can do an
entire<00:02:23.989> control<00:02:24.440> man<00:02:24.650> without<00:02:25.750> capturing<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
entire control man without capturing a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.750 
entire control man without capturing a
single<00:02:27.319> note<00:02:27.470> I've<00:02:27.680> done<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.069> it's<00:02:28.310> it's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
single note I've done it it's it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.520 
single note I've done it it's it's
ridiculous<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:30.050> do<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.440> without

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
ridiculous that you can do it without

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.710 
ridiculous that you can do it without
without<00:02:31.250> doing<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.640> objective<00:02:32.209> at<00:02:32.330> all<00:02:32.450> but

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
without doing the objective at all but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.229 
without doing the objective at all but
you<00:02:33.260> are<00:02:33.410> capable<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.580> doing<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.150> hopefully

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
you are capable of doing and hopefully

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.210 
you are capable of doing and hopefully
rift<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.930> not<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.800> will<00:02:36.890> rely

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
rift is not like that and it will rely

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.979 
rift is not like that and it will rely
heavily<00:02:37.489> on<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.970> actually<00:02:38.150> capturing<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
heavily on you actually capturing the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.570 
heavily on you actually capturing the
spark<00:02:39.319> in<00:02:39.440> your<00:02:39.500> enemy's<00:02:39.769> base<00:02:39.920> let<00:02:40.400> me<00:02:40.459> know

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
spark in your enemy's base let me know

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.890 
spark in your enemy's base let me know
how<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.790> feel<00:02:41.090> about<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.420> looks<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.780> this

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
how you feel about the looks of this

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.300 
how you feel about the looks of this
