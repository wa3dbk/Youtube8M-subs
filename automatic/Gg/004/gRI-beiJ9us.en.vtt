00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.020 
but it's a grind of five kilometer grind
up<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> top<00:00:43.270> of<00:00:43.830> Lantau<00:00:44.830> peak<00:00:45.129> which<00:00:45.640> sits

at<00:00:46.410> 930<00:00:47.410> meters<00:00:47.800> but<00:00:48.070> it's<00:00:48.190> a<00:00:48.309> beautiful<00:00:49.000> climb

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.100 

I<00:00:56.790> think<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.910> biggest<00:00:58.090> best<00:00:58.600> advice<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.080> ever

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
I think the biggest best advice I ever

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.000 
I think the biggest best advice I ever
got<00:00:59.500> is<00:01:00.150> speed<00:01:01.150> work<00:01:01.390> up<00:01:01.660> hills<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.470> know

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
got is speed work up hills and you know

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.480 
got is speed work up hills and you know
if<00:01:03.220> you<00:01:03.370> can<00:01:03.610> do<00:01:04.320> 20<00:01:05.320> seconds<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.800> minute<00:01:06.100> if<00:01:06.280> you

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
if you can do 20 seconds a minute if you

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010 
if you can do 20 seconds a minute if you
can<00:01:06.640> as<00:01:06.760> hard<00:01:06.970> as<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.120> can<00:01:07.240> up<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.540> hill<00:01:07.750> and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
can as hard as you can up that hill and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.810 
can as hard as you can up that hill and
then<00:01:08.440> rest<00:01:08.710> for<00:01:08.980> a<00:01:09.010> minute

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
then rest for a minute

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.000 
then rest for a minute
just<00:01:10.240> getting<00:01:10.540> speed<00:01:10.930> on<00:01:11.140> those<00:01:11.320> hills<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.740> so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
just getting speed on those hills is so

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.580 
just getting speed on those hills is so
in

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.069 
in
but<00:01:13.520> also<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.850> think<00:01:13.909> pacing<00:01:14.539> yourself<00:01:14.899> some

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
but also I think pacing yourself some

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.990 
but also I think pacing yourself some
people<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.469> think<00:01:15.740> start<00:01:16.009> way<00:01:16.250> too<00:01:16.310> hard<00:01:16.789> at<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
people I think start way too hard at the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.910 
people I think start way too hard at the
beginning<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.600> they're<00:01:18.109> dead<00:01:18.380> halfway

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
beginning and they're dead halfway

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.800 
beginning and they're dead halfway
through<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.880> know<00:01:20.000> take<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.270> easy<00:01:20.539> and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
through so you know take it easy and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.120 
through so you know take it easy and
save<00:01:21.079> something<00:01:21.350> for<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.590> end<00:01:21.770> if<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:21.979> can

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.819 

you<00:01:27.430> know<00:01:27.549> sky<00:01:27.880> running<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.390> me<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.840> about<00:01:29.560> the

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
you know sky running to me is about the

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.069 
you know sky running to me is about the
very<00:01:30.070> terrain<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.729> about<00:01:31.030> going<00:01:31.719> up<00:01:31.899> the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
very terrain and about going up the

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.300 
very terrain and about going up the
mountains<00:01:32.439> and<00:01:32.649> getting<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.100> highest

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
mountains and getting to the highest

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.819 
mountains and getting to the highest
peaks<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.329> that's<00:01:34.930> what<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:35.530> know<00:01:35.649> I've

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
peaks and and that's what you know I've

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.380 
peaks and and that's what you know I've
already<00:01:36.070> gotten<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.490> top<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.880> two<00:01:37.060> peaks

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
already gotten to the top of two peaks

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.600 
already gotten to the top of two peaks
and<00:01:37.659> I've<00:01:38.380> been<00:01:38.590> here<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:38.799> less<00:01:39.130> than<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.399> day

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
and I've been here for less than a day

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.419 
and I've been here for less than a day
so<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.659> potential<00:01:41.110> here<00:01:41.500> is<00:01:41.590> incredible<00:01:42.219> and

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
so the potential here is incredible and

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.460 
so the potential here is incredible and
it's<00:01:43.090> it's<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.570> new<00:01:43.750> world<00:01:43.960> when<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.259> get<00:01:44.350> to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
it's it's a new world when you get to

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.330 
it's it's a new world when you get to
the<00:01:44.560> top<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.920> mountain

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
the top of the mountain

00:01:45.340 --> 00:02:02.840 
the top of the mountain
so<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.520> really<00:01:46.119> do<00:01:46.270> hope<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.659> takes<00:01:47.049> off

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.909
