heavy<00:01:47.030> snow<00:01:47.180> at<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.600> moment<00:01:47.870> we<00:01:48.170> come<00:01:48.410> out<00:01:48.500> and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
heavy snow at the moment we come out and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.470 
heavy snow at the moment we come out and
brush<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:49.100> off<00:01:49.280> what<00:01:49.730> was<00:01:49.820> happening<00:01:50.330> was

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
brush this off what was happening was

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.540 
brush this off what was happening was
the<00:01:50.990> section<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.590> tent<00:01:51.830> was<00:01:52.040> getting<00:01:52.370> very

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
the section the tent was getting very

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.150 
the section the tent was getting very
heavy<00:01:52.790> um<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.500> think<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:54.860> would<00:01:55.070> have

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
heavy um and I think what would have

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.640 
heavy um and I think what would have
ultimately<00:01:55.670> happened<00:01:56.420> these<00:01:56.960> poles<00:01:57.290> wouldn't

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
ultimately happened these poles wouldn't

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.290 
ultimately happened these poles wouldn't
have<00:01:57.740> taken<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.220> snow<00:01:58.460> load<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:58.940> lost

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
have taken the snow load so we lost

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.450 
have taken the snow load so we lost
those<00:01:59.510> there<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.950> base<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.280> what<00:02:01.370> we've

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
those there and the base of what we've

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.249 
those there and the base of what we've
been<00:02:01.490> doing<00:02:01.910> is<00:02:02.030> coming<00:02:02.270> out<00:02:02.510> here<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:05.259> quick

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
been doing is coming out here a quick

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.980 
been doing is coming out here a quick
shake<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.800> this<00:02:06.830> um<00:02:07.420> are<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.540> tents<00:02:08.780> ready

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
shake like this um are the tents ready

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.580 
shake like this um are the tents ready
to<00:02:09.110> go<00:02:09.259> again

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
to go again

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.280 
to go again
