minute but that would be a problem with

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.320 
minute but that would be a problem with
me<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.750> yeah<00:02:07.990> reliability<00:02:08.830> for<00:02:09.009> one<00:02:09.159> there<00:02:09.729> but

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
me so yeah reliability for one there but

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.849 
me so yeah reliability for one there but
it's<00:02:10.479> basically<00:02:10.779> on<00:02:10.989> past<00:02:11.230> few<00:02:11.469> drives<00:02:11.709> with

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
it's basically on past few drives with

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.349 
it's basically on past few drives with
my<00:02:11.980> macbook<00:02:12.310> air<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:12.579> I<00:02:12.639> won't<00:02:12.790> see<00:02:12.999> a<00:02:13.029> drop<00:02:13.329> in

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.359 
my macbook air so I won't see a drop in

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.920 
my macbook air so I won't see a drop in
performance<00:02:13.930> there

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
performance there

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.490 
performance there
and<00:02:15.019> it's<00:02:15.590> also<00:02:16.150> incredibly<00:02:17.500> customizable

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and it's also incredibly customizable

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.110 
and it's also incredibly customizable
and<00:02:18.650> upgradable<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.400> I'll<00:02:19.489> go<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.000> in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and upgradable and I'll go on to that in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.940 
and upgradable and I'll go on to that in
a<00:02:20.209> minute<00:02:20.329> but<00:02:20.569> basically<00:02:21.010> as<00:02:22.010> an<00:02:22.250> all-around

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
a minute but basically as an all-around

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.050 
a minute but basically as an all-around
product<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.220> think<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.760> probably<00:02:25.909> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
product I think this is probably the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.089 
product I think this is probably the
most<00:02:26.209> well<00:02:26.480> balancing<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.110> could<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:27.379> with<00:02:27.590> and

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
most well balancing I could go with and

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.890 
most well balancing I could go with and
as<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.340> saw<00:02:28.489> there<00:02:28.640> was<00:02:28.730> no<00:02:28.909> top<00:02:29.269> case<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.750> that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
as you saw there was no top case on that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.559 
as you saw there was no top case on that
macbook<00:02:30.640> obviously<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> bare-bones<00:02:32.150> unit

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
macbook obviously was a bare-bones unit

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.479 
macbook obviously was a bare-bones unit
there<00:02:32.659> was<00:02:32.750> nothing<00:02:33.019> else<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.409> so<00:02:34.250> that

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
there was nothing else to it so that

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.660 
there was nothing else to it so that
allowed<00:02:34.760> me<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.030> pick<00:02:35.750> up<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:36.260> brand<00:02:36.950> spanking

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
allowed me to pick up a brand spanking

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.839 
allowed me to pick up a brand spanking
new<00:02:37.700> top<00:02:38.209> case<00:02:38.680> no<00:02:39.680> cracks<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.370> whatsoever

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
new top case no cracks on it whatsoever

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.319 
new top case no cracks on it whatsoever
it's<00:02:41.599> all<00:02:41.920> absolutely<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.129> perfect<00:02:43.909> condition

it's all absolutely in perfect condition

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.740 
it's all absolutely in perfect condition
I<00:02:44.390> have<00:02:44.510> never<00:02:44.810> seen<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.940> MacBook<00:02:46.970> I'd<00:02:47.329> never

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
I have never seen a MacBook I'd never

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.089 
I have never seen a MacBook I'd never
seen<00:02:47.959> at<00:02:48.109> their<00:02:48.200> white<00:02:48.379> map<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.769> brand-new

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
seen at their white map of brand-new

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.910 
seen at their white map of brand-new
distances<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:50.060> see<00:02:50.239> one<00:02:50.480> not<00:02:51.049> cracked<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.769> not

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
distances to see one not cracked and not

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.910 
distances to see one not cracked and not
all<00:02:52.099> shiny<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.810> brown<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.709> really

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
all shiny and brown it's just really

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.030 
all shiny and brown it's just really
really<00:02:55.129> cool<00:02:56.139> those<00:02:57.139> keys<00:02:57.440> won't<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.799> staying

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
really cool those keys won't be staying

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.099 
really cool those keys won't be staying
of<00:02:58.250> course<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:59.359> power<00:02:59.599> button<00:02:59.810> won't<00:03:00.019> be

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
of course that power button won't be

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:00.580 
of course that power button won't be
staying

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
staying

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.940 
staying
and<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:01.879> trackpad<00:03:02.569> would<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.930> say<00:03:03.109> stay<00:03:03.769> in

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and that trackpad would be say stay in

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.000 
and that trackpad would be say stay in
so<00:03:04.280> um<00:03:04.870> yeah<00:03:05.870> let's<00:03:06.079> let's<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.500> sort<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.680> get

geforce<00:04:18.979> 9400m<00:04:19.940> graphics<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:21.409> is<00:04:21.590> the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
geforce 9400m graphics this is the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.560 
geforce 9400m graphics this is the
battery<00:04:21.889> and<00:04:22.639> we've<00:04:22.789> decided<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.180> go<00:04:23.360> with<00:04:23.389> an

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
battery and we've decided to go with an

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.170 
battery and we've decided to go with an
official<00:04:24.139> apple<00:04:24.560> battery<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.969> seller

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
official apple battery the seller

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
official apple battery the seller
clastic<00:04:26.659> is<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.289> plus<00:04:27.800> grades

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
clastic is a a plus grades

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.189 
clastic is a a plus grades
so<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.120> basically<00:04:29.240> means<00:04:29.540> gonna<00:04:29.840> have<00:04:29.990> less

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
so that basically means gonna have less

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.439 
so that basically means gonna have less
than<00:04:30.350> 50<00:04:30.770> cycles<00:04:30.949> on<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.000> this<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.210> going<00:04:32.330> to

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
than 50 cycles on it so this is going to

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.909 
than 50 cycles on it so this is going to
be<00:04:32.570> basically<00:04:32.900> like<00:04:33.199> having<00:04:33.259> a<00:04:33.560> brand

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
be basically like having a brand

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.670 
be basically like having a brand
spanking<00:04:34.460> new<00:04:34.600> battery<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:35.780> didn't<00:04:36.440> go<00:04:36.530> with<00:04:36.560> a

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
spanking new battery I didn't go with a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.480 
spanking new battery I didn't go with a
third<00:04:36.860> party<00:04:37.070> room<00:04:37.370> because<00:04:38.889> well<00:04:39.889> they're<00:04:40.460> a

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
third party room because well they're a

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.110 
third party room because well they're a
bit<00:04:40.669> shift<00:04:41.000> for<00:04:41.360> one<00:04:41.570> battery<00:04:42.050> life<00:04:42.199> wise<00:04:42.410> and

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
bit shift for one battery life wise and

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.060 
bit shift for one battery life wise and
they're<00:04:44.120> really<00:04:44.360> not<00:04:45.169> very<00:04:45.380> good<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.680> terms<00:04:45.949> of

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
they're really not very good in terms of

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.810 
they're really not very good in terms of
safety<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.759> they<00:04:47.120> can<00:04:47.270> catch<00:04:47.449> fire<00:04:47.780> and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
safety that they can catch fire and

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.670 
safety that they can catch fire and
basically<00:04:49.820> expand<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.449> Stefan<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:51.110> don't

like two finger scrolling the earlier

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.040 
like two finger scrolling the earlier
than<00:07:00.290> a<00:07:00.380> MacBook<00:07:00.890> MacBook<00:07:01.100> Pro<00:07:02.050> supports
