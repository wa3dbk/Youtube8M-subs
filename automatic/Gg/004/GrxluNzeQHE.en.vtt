00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010 

okay<00:00:00.269> so<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.810> hostile<00:00:01.230> HOH<00:00:01.740> with<00:00:02.700> the

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
okay so this is the hostile HOH with the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay so this is the hostile HOH with the
oscillating<00:00:04.549> leading<00:00:05.549> blade<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.410> this<00:00:07.410> works

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
oscillating leading blade and this works

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.959 
oscillating leading blade and this works
really<00:00:07.890> well<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.880> flat<00:00:09.480> rows<00:00:10.040> with<00:00:11.040> very<00:00:11.460> small

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
really well on flat rows with very small

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.780 
really well on flat rows with very small
weeds<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:13.230> push<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.610> don't

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
weeds you can just push it you don't

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.420 
weeds you can just push it you don't
have<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.030> back<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:15.929> all<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> almost

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
have to back it up at all this is almost

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.010 
have to back it up at all this is almost
perfect<00:00:17.930> for<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.080> mole<00:00:19.320> right<00:00:19.619> now<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
perfect for this mole right now with the

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
perfect for this mole right now with the
soil<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.830> tiny<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.279> moist<00:00:23.730> but

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
soil just a little tiny bit moist but

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.720 
soil just a little tiny bit moist but
mostly<00:00:24.390> dry<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.560> weeds<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.099> very<00:00:26.340> tiny

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
mostly dry and the weeds are very tiny

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.660 
mostly dry and the weeds are very tiny
as<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:29.099> cuts<00:00:29.369> right

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
as you can see I just put it cuts right

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.669 
as you can see I just put it cuts right
under<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> breeze<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> only<00:00:31.140> drawback

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
under the breeze and the only drawback

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.040 
under the breeze and the only drawback
is<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.920> sometimes<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> can't<00:00:32.850> tell<00:00:33.210> where

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is that sometimes you can't tell where

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
is that sometimes you can't tell where
you<00:00:34.230> leave<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.969> into<00:00:36.239> these

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you leave it now going into these

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.340 
you leave it now going into these
thicker<00:00:36.930> weeds<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.980> still<00:00:38.489> use<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> hoe

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
thicker weeds you can still use the hoe

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.680 
thicker weeds you can still use the hoe
but<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.340> back<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.820> quite<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
but I have to back up quite a bit and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.020 
but I have to back up quite a bit and
it's<00:00:43.020> much<00:00:43.680> harder<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:46.399> normally<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's much harder and normally in a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.049 
it's much harder and normally in a
setting<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.460> would<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.670> ahead<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
setting like this I would go ahead and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.510 
setting like this I would go ahead and
use<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> different<00:00:51.719> hole<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
use a different hole there use the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
use a different hole there use the
peasant<00:00:54.000> hole<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> Rhodes<00:00:55.680> hole<00:00:57.379> but<00:00:58.379> even

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
peasant hole or the Rhodes hole but even

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
peasant hole or the Rhodes hole but even
so<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:01.079> faster<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.660> actually

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so it's just so much faster I actually

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.890 
so it's just so much faster I actually
did<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.439> time<00:01:04.920> test<00:01:05.659> whether<00:01:06.659> it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
did a little time test whether it's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
did a little time test whether it's
faster<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> end

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
faster to put it all the way to the end

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
faster to put it all the way to the end
of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> row<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> turn<00:01:11.520> around<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:13.280> go

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of the row and then turn around and go

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.639 
of the row and then turn around and go
back<00:01:15.979> like<00:01:16.979> so

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.230 

or<00:01:22.649> whether<00:01:23.039> it<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:26.250> read<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> me

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
or whether it be here to read it to me

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.279 
or whether it be here to read it to me
faster<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.130> read<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> whole<00:01:29.850> whole<00:01:30.600> width

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
faster to to read the whole whole width

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:39.169 
faster to to read the whole whole width
at<00:01:31.530> once<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:32.429> like<00:01:32.609> this<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.579> fact<00:01:38.640> it's

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
at once going like this and in fact it's

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.639 
at once going like this and in fact it's
faster<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.899> this<00:01:40.079> way

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
faster to go this way

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.830 
faster to go this way
go<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.429> the<00:01:41.549> way<00:01:41.579> down<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.329> end<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
go all the way down to the end of the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.709 
go all the way down to the end of the
row<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.289> then<00:01:43.409> turn<00:01:43.770> around<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.479> didn't<00:01:45.479> time

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
row and then turn around I didn't time

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.959 
row and then turn around I didn't time
it<00:01:45.750> exactly<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.770> use<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> same<00:01:47.369> song<00:01:47.729> as

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
it exactly I just use the same song as

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.649 
it exactly I just use the same song as
thanks<00:01:48.359> price<00:01:48.569> on<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:48.929> end<00:01:49.140> behavior<00:01:50.509> in<00:01:51.509> any

thanks price on my end behavior in any
case<00:01:51.989> I<00:01:52.489> do<00:01:53.489> recommend<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:56.130> haas<00:01:56.700> wheel<00:01:57.149> hoe

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
case I do recommend the haas wheel hoe

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.190 
case I do recommend the haas wheel hoe
even<00:01:58.500> though<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.739> does<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.399> some<00:01:59.789> pretty

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
even though it does have some pretty

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.160 
even though it does have some pretty
pretty<00:02:01.200> significant<00:02:01.860> limitations<00:02:03.049> but<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
pretty significant limitations but it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.749 
pretty significant limitations but it
works<00:02:04.379> so<00:02:04.649> well<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.899> pony<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.549> can
