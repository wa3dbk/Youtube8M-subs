thing going on here then you take the
long<00:02:02.640> side<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.860> flip<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.920> around<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.670> head

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
long side and flip it around your head

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.040 
long side and flip it around your head
like<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.670> um<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.479> can

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
like so and that is that um you can

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
like so and that is that um you can
make<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.560> longer<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.340> want<00:02:12.110> or<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.170> can

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
make this longer if you want or you can

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.370 
make this longer if you want or you can
make<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.920> shorter<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.240> usually<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.110> would

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
make this shorter so usually I would

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.100 
make this shorter so usually I would
just<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.770> for<00:02:16.800> about<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.490> size<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
just go for about this size and that is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.100 
just go for about this size and that is
look<00:02:19.350> number<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.330> look<00:02:21.450> number<00:02:21.480> two

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
look number one so for look number two

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.030 
look number one so for look number two
is<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:24.000> kind<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.570> days<00:02:24.930> where<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.560> hop

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
is this kind of on days where I just hop

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.060

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to so then you take this side and just

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.280 
to so then you take this side and just
bring<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.290> across<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.990> all

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
bring that across like that that is all

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.430 
bring that across like that that is all
like<00:02:58.590> super<00:02:58.860> easy<00:02:59.220> not<00:03:00.150> even<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:00.930> safety

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
like super easy not even you know safety

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.110 
like super easy not even you know safety
pins<00:03:01.620> needed<00:03:02.040> not<00:03:02.310> even<00:03:02.580> straight<00:03:02.880> pins

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
pins needed not even straight pins

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.420 
pins needed not even straight pins
needed<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.470> course<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> want<00:03:05.280> do

that or what I also like to do is for if
I<00:03:08.550> want<00:03:08.760> more<00:03:08.940> coverage<00:03:09.180> then<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.440> um

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
I want more coverage then I just um

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.770 
I want more coverage then I just um
double<00:03:11.730> fold<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:13.250> bring<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
double fold it like this and bring that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.229 
double fold it like this and bring that
around<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.730> will<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.030> look

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
around like so so that will be look

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.530 
around like so so that will be look
number<00:03:18.450> two<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.700> then<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.760> also<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:21.300> another

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
number two and then I also have another

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.780 
number two and then I also have another
way<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.080> doing<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.250> third<00:03:23.550> look

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
way of doing it for the third look

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.220 
way of doing it for the third look
you're<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.360> double<00:03:24.690> all<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.050> go<00:03:25.170> to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
you're going to double all you go to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.810 
you're going to double all you go to
fold<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.700> car<00:03:26.970> somewhat<00:03:27.390> inwards<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.820> make

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
fold this car somewhat inwards and make

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.210 
fold this car somewhat inwards and make
sure<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.480> creates<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.350> arch<00:03:31.680> on

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
sure that it creates like this arch on

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.210 
sure that it creates like this arch on
your<00:03:32.489> head<00:03:32.790> um<00:03:33.500> doesn't<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.800> be<00:03:34.920> anything

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
safety pin that um actually you now you

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.120 
safety pin that um actually you now you
will<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.959> left<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.350> short<00:03:43.650> side<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:43.860> with

will be left with a short side and with

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.650 
will be left with a short side and with
the<00:03:44.220> lock<00:03:44.400> side<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.120> leave<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.420> short

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
the lock side I like to leave the short

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.229 
the lock side I like to leave the short
side<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.440> outside<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.060> like

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
side just outside like that then I like

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.690 
side just outside like that then I like
to<00:03:48.390> take<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.690> long<00:03:48.870> side<00:03:49.200> bring<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.550> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
to take the long side bring it to the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.070 
to take the long side bring it to the
back<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.500> just<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.660> flip<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.900> around

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
back and just like that flip that around
