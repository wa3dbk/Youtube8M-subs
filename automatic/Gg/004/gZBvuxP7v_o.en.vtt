00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.860
 We are here in beautiful Berlin 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.810
 and what you draw in the background is 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.400
 a wonderful projection in one 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.080
 showcase pure and we at the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.120
 other house wall also only the projection 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.650
 directly on the house wall on it and that 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.430
 whole but make the new windows phone 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.660
 8 want to represent 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.460
 the projection shows the operating concept 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.539
 of windows phone we already know 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.039
 for several years 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.989
 they show the live tiles 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.969
 different sizes but the clou on it 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.969
 is it actually live that is 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.230
 We take pictures and some people like 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 you can maybe see in the background 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.850
 actually appears in the projection 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.789
 that you can do that with the lifestyle 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.309
 content around relies more on touch operation 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.679
 is just what is now in the home market 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.460
 desired microsoft in mine 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.460
 consistently around 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.670
 so we're all in the warm one 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.070
 together our partners with htc nokia 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.520
 samsung but in particular show how the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.540
 devices the services and tablets and xbox 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.030
 play with each other 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 that is how does xbox music work 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.800
 on the of on the tray on the Xbox 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.130
 or business scenarios or of course 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.130
 also gaming 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.770
 i can still feel the glass surfaces 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.690
 much better design yourself much freer 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.620
 and thereby the visualized can be 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.630
 the beautiful is really we can 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.119
 work between superlative that is 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.310
 we have devices with the best display 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.660
 have devices with the best camera and 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.000
 of course with the best software 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.860
 we put the users center and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.780
 regardless of which way it is 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.220
 the experience we have is moving with the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.220
 Devices can always do the same
