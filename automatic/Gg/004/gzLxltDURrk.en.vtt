hi<00:00:13.400> I'm<00:00:14.119> Damien<00:00:14.570> I'm<00:00:15.019> one<00:00:15.199> of<00:00:15.289> the<00:00:15.349> developers

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
hi I'm Damien I'm one of the developers

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.880 
hi I'm Damien I'm one of the developers
behind<00:00:16.039> that<00:00:16.640> seat<00:00:17.289> and<00:00:18.289> I'm<00:00:18.470> going<00:00:18.710> to<00:00:18.770> talk

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
behind that seat and I'm going to talk

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.679 
behind that seat and I'm going to talk
about<00:00:18.919> the<00:00:19.310> inventory<00:00:19.700> system<00:00:19.820> that<00:00:20.119> we<00:00:20.270> have

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.900 

as<00:00:23.689> you<00:00:23.869> might<00:00:24.020> already<00:00:24.230> know<00:00:24.590> we<00:00:25.400> are<00:00:25.640> all

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
as you might already know we are all

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.639 
as you might already know we are all
about<00:00:26.090> immersion<00:00:26.419> we're<00:00:27.410> constantly

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
about immersion we're constantly

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.339 
about immersion we're constantly
obsessed<00:00:28.309> about<00:00:28.610> how<00:00:28.790> to<00:00:28.849> find<00:00:29.180> tweak<00:00:29.660> modify

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
obsessed about how to find tweak modify

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.740 
obsessed about how to find tweak modify
improve<00:00:30.860> bits<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:31.430> pieces<00:00:31.669> of<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.000> game<00:00:32.210> so

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
improve bits and pieces of the game so

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.500 
improve bits and pieces of the game so
it<00:00:32.840> forms<00:00:33.079> a<00:00:33.230> coherent<00:00:33.739> whole<00:00:34.059> how<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.120> sound

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
it forms a coherent whole how the sound

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.660 
it forms a coherent whole how the sound
can<00:00:35.719> react<00:00:35.989> with<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.260> visual<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.129> visual

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
can react with the visual and visual

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.940 
can react with the visual and visual
elements<00:00:38.059> how<00:00:38.450> they<00:00:38.690> can<00:00:38.870> react<00:00:39.170> with<00:00:39.260> textual

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
just hearing a sample played over and

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.410

give<00:00:59.059> off<00:00:59.149> sound<00:00:59.479> as<00:00:59.659> if<00:00:59.809> it<00:01:00.019> was<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.379> real<00:01:00.920> thing

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.149 
give off sound as if it was a real thing
we<00:01:02.479> do<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:02.780> by<00:01:03.019> implementing<00:01:03.499> hundreds<00:01:04.040> of

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
we do this by implementing hundreds of

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.580 
we do this by implementing hundreds of
sounds<00:01:04.610> launched<00:01:05.269> within<00:01:05.449> certain<00:01:06.200> random

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
give off procedural sounds which almost

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.200 
give off procedural sounds which almost
always<00:01:11.450> sound<00:01:11.990> fresh<00:01:12.350> when<00:01:12.650> activated<00:01:13.210> well
