the animation on falling sword used to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
the animation on falling sword used to
be<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.189> clunky<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.330> been<00:00:30.510> sped

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
be really clunky but now it's been sped

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.840 
be really clunky but now it's been sped
up<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.380> land<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.830> lot<00:00:31.980> quicker<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.700> can

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
up you land a lot quicker and you can

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
act quicker after landing the hammer

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.760 
act quicker after landing the hammer
dance<00:00:35.730> set<00:00:35.940> also<00:00:36.180> now<00:00:36.660> buffs<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.350> damage<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
dance set also now buffs the damage of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.709

falling<00:00:38.100> sword<00:00:38.399> by<00:00:38.879> more<00:00:39.180> than<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.450> used<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
falling sword by more than it used to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
falling sword by more than it used to
but<00:00:40.140> really<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> removal<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but really it's the removal of the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
but really it's the removal of the
clunkiness<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> major<00:00:42.660> selling

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
clunkiness that is the major selling

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
clunkiness that is the major selling
point<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> next<00:00:44.219> change<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.120> are

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
point so the next change is that we are

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
point so the next change is that we are
dropping<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.200> generator<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.860> suggested<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
dropping the generator I suggested a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.069 
dropping the generator I suggested a
variant<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.149> which<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.450> would<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
variant in which we would not use a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
variant in which we would not use a
generator<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:50.640> going

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
generator and that is what we're going

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.580 
generator and that is what we're going
to<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.239> instead<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> use<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to go with instead we're going to use a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.220 
to go with instead we're going to use a
Koretz<00:00:53.039> champion<00:00:53.550> prophet<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.989> fact

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
Koretz champion prophet and in fact
