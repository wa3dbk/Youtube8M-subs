00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.330
 They know that I like to say it like that because 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.500
 it seems more as long as it would be the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.360

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.780
 So, well, they are leaving and what is it 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.149
 remember hand remember this part that 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.949
 it's very important they have to have those 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.179
 three active options goes from any 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.100
 way you have some doubt you 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.989
 carnal that perhaps the first time 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.979
 that you see this type of motorcycle this 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.050
 here below I also leave you a 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.449
 description wake the first part 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.659
 you can go to update 14 then 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.769
 where I explain better not where to see if 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.960
 I'm explaining a little bit more 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.299
 detailed how is this used 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.010
 then good and without further ado this 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.930
 preamble is channel let's read saw the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.970
 version number 15 that that is we add 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.200
 just two things but that are 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.969
 too important 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.979
 because my pussy seems like that I can not 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.259
 get down here on the bottom of the carnal 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.960
 is that I have no idea what to say but 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.549
 down the disabled there's night boy here 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.460
 down there is a button and that button for what 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.470
 Use us to add this 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.420
 to add points like in the waypoint 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.500
 that we can transport ourselves then 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.570
 well here are the buttons for 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.100
 add and to remove we will give in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.650
 adn and we will ask for a name for the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.760
 point where we are standing ok I'll go 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.920
 to put now he will show you the good 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.780
 from another time and here they will be 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.310
 you can have different points later 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.680
 that you give a touch to which you 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.659
 you want even if you even move 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.759
 Carlos to the thing is that a 7 say 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.200
 exactly like the waypoint 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.810
 you just give a touch here and you go to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.190
 reappear right where you were in 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.200
 2 good if you can go adding more 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.060
 giving you simply in ade or if you want 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.550
 remove some dale in a rhythm and play 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.490
 this the little box that you want and ready 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.110
 so then good channels is that and the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.670
 another thing that was also added is in the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.440
 part of schering shockey in the part of 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.269
 that links here the new button was added 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.780
 it says plugin survival that simply 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:15.080
 is to be able to fly in the mode of 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.080
 surf dancing the tics then good 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.730
 is this you can not just fly like this 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.140
 of simple as we know how to fly in 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.780
 creative only I want what can you 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.940
 do in survival mode then that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 is what channels added not now yes 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.640
 that are not just two little things but 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.370
 those simple 2 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.890
 it helps too much to transport 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
 so then nothing is simply that and 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.880
 if you have any doubt you already know 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.950

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.390

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.900
 down here from the last review that says 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.580

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.990
 this new addition we will then then 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.850

 I do it and I tell them it's a freckle that 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.730
 they have to install as a complement 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.290
 Obviously, how is that? 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.270
 just having both options 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.250

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.450
 Well now what to say is new in this 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.890

 something the channel very interesting the review 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.790
 of a game that they asked me for 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.930

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.380
 small because they are not recognized but 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.240
 for something started I think that if you 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.250
 let's do for these carnal people 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.810

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.700
 dynamic to earn a card 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.590
 google play here is going to be interesting 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.410
