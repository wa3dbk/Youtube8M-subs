shift or whatever I should say so I

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.850

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
think they're gonna try to fix that / -

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.259 
think they're gonna try to fix that / -
thing<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.519> wanted<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:42.970> tell<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.209> guys

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
thing I just wanted to tell you guys

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.330 
thing I just wanted to tell you guys
that<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.079> is<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.410> braces<00:02:44.799> update<00:02:45.130> so

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
that because this is a braces update so

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.819 
that because this is a braces update so
I<00:02:45.370> should<00:02:45.670> get<00:02:45.790> pretty<00:02:46.030> specific<00:02:46.540> right<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.500> I

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
I should get pretty specific right so I

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.220 
I should get pretty specific right so I
think<00:02:48.459> they<00:02:48.970> need<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.209> align<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.810> center<00:02:50.140> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
think they need to align the center of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.100 
think they need to align the center of
my<00:02:50.349> teeth<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:51.579> my<00:02:51.700> next<00:02:52.000> thing<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:52.810> we'll<00:02:52.930> see

what<00:02:53.200> happens<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:53.739> I'm<00:02:54.069> sure<00:02:54.370> they're<00:02:54.549> gonna

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
what happens but I'm sure they're gonna

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.400

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.260 
paranoid hope that periwinkle it's like
a<00:05:18.720> lightish<00:05:19.370> purple<00:05:20.370> color<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.669> think<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:21.090> don't

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
a lightish purple color I think I don't

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.370 
a lightish purple color I think I don't
know<00:05:21.360> what<00:05:21.479> periwinkle<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.110> don't<00:05:22.260> know

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
know what periwinkle is I don't know

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.140 
know what periwinkle is I don't know
it's<00:05:22.919> like<00:05:23.100> purple<00:05:23.400> or<00:05:23.490> something<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.940> that

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
it's like purple or something like that

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.960 
it's like purple or something like that
but<00:05:24.630> it<00:05:24.810> fades<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.410> really<00:05:25.800> nice<00:05:26.070> color<00:05:26.700> like

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
but it fades to a really nice color like

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.820 
but it fades to a really nice color like
it<00:05:27.120> blends<00:05:27.419> nicely<00:05:27.720> with<00:05:27.990> your<00:05:28.229> natural<00:05:28.410> tooth

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
it blends nicely with your natural tooth

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.440 
it blends nicely with your natural tooth
color<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.460> doesn't<00:05:29.820> turn<00:05:29.940> red<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.419> doesn't

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
color it doesn't turn red it doesn't

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.760 
color it doesn't turn red it doesn't
turn<00:05:30.780> green<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.169> doesn't<00:05:31.410> turn<00:05:31.530> all<00:05:31.650> these

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
turn green it doesn't turn all these

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.640 
turn green it doesn't turn all these
funky<00:05:32.310> gross<00:05:32.580> colors<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:34.110> still<00:05:34.620> looks

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
funky gross colors and it still looks

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.860
