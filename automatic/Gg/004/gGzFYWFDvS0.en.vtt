00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.429
 and we are here 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.050
 we believe there are 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.090
 giving situations 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.560
 in the heras he has published 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.410
 that can be qualified 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.290
 aggressions to this type of education 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.150
 by the educational administration of the community of madrid and 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.020
 explained 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 basically the reasons in this region in 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.090
 p 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.860
 nor the last years 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 practically in all the schools that are being created 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.880
 by effective two 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.020
 It seems to me that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.860
 mention that the administration 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.340
 Madrid 6 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.560
 continue with this bet ica 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.540
 it is a doubly harmful policy 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.920
 it's about that 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.940
 the public land 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.120
 efe - the town halls 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.050
 percent 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.330
 forever then 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 that private-owned centers are not public 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.430
 the city councils from there that demand the community of madrid 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 in front of public centers 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 where I would go they offer a floor 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.930
 to make a concerted private center 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.980
 percent 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.480
 It shows favorable 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.300
 and where it was read for alleged crimes 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 to be a public official 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760
 tremosa 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.930
 It does not seem that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.040
 nicolás public plaza 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 is in teaching 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.670
 where obviously 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 do not even do private centers 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.470
 relatives both the soil and 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.700
 like education 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.420
 he gets paid 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.770
 the private initiative gonzález 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 where you have freedom but with public funds 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.589
 All public 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.869
 that policy 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.689
 prioritize absolutely 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.939
 alonso to the centers lee 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.349
 private arranged 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.759
 then the air 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.669
 that is the reason for our federation 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.090
 it also draws attention current administration public opinion 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.779
 about what is going on in educational matters ordinary people 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.889
 this offering something 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.899
 the base derrick rose 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.919
 r 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.939
 there will be
