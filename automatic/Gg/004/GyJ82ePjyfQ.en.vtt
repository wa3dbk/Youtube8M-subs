00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.820 

you<00:00:00.599> can<00:00:00.810> pluck<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.800> string<00:00:02.179> and<00:00:03.830> that

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
you can pluck the string and that

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.909 
you can pluck the string and that
vibration<00:00:05.040> will<00:00:05.609> will<00:00:06.120> happen<00:00:06.450> but<00:00:07.200> also<00:00:07.560> we

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
vibration will will happen but also we

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.980 
vibration will will happen but also we
use<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> bow<00:00:08.519> if<00:00:08.730> if<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.120> want<00:00:09.300> something<00:00:09.570> more

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
use a bow if if you want something more

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.870 
use a bow if if you want something more
legato<00:00:10.830> or<00:00:11.809> long<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.990> singing<00:00:13.639> then<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.759> will

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
legato or long and singing then you will

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.470 
legato or long and singing then you will
use<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> bow<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.199> elongate<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.279> sound<00:00:20.480> that's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
use a bow to elongate that sound that's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.620 
use a bow to elongate that sound that's
just<00:00:21.750> basically<00:00:22.199> an<00:00:22.769> elongation<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
just basically an elongation of that I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.060 
just basically an elongation of that I
don't<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.410> see<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
don't know if you can see it on the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.140 
don't know if you can see it on the
camera<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:28.220> twine<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.460> string<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
camera but if I twine that string and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.639 
camera but if I twine that string and
then<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.619> bow<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> actually<00:00:34.350> see

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
then if I bow it you can actually see

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
then if I bow it you can actually see
the<00:00:34.770> string<00:00:35.010> vibrating<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.880> exactly<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the string vibrating it in exactly the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.300 
the string vibrating it in exactly the
same<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.290> longer

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.550 

there's<00:00:44.000> very<00:00:44.270> many<00:00:44.510> different<00:00:44.810> effects<00:00:45.380> you

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
there's very many different effects you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.630 
there's very many different effects you
can<00:00:45.710> get<00:00:45.950> with<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.460> bow<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:48.200> most<00:00:48.620> useful<00:00:49.220> one

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
can get with a bow the most useful one

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.950 
can get with a bow the most useful one
is<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.900> long<00:00:54.140> singing<00:00:54.680> term<00:00:55.640> which<00:00:55.960> which

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
is the the long singing term which which

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.760 
is the the long singing term which which
string<00:00:57.380> instruments<00:00:57.890> are<00:00:58.989> renowned<00:00:59.989> for<00:01:00.260> and

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
string instruments are renowned for and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.640 
string instruments are renowned for and
you<00:01:01.640> don't<00:01:01.670> have<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.210> take<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.449> breath<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.410> you

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
you don't have to take a breath so you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.900 
you don't have to take a breath so you
can<00:01:03.980> go<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.220> for<00:01:04.520> forever<00:01:05.150> with<00:01:05.479> it

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.430 

there<00:01:11.910> are<00:01:12.090> other<00:01:12.540> effects<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.230> get

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
there are other effects you can get

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.020 
there are other effects you can get
which<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:15.260> shorter<00:01:16.260> note<00:01:19.370> speak<00:01:20.370> harto<00:01:20.790> which

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
which are shorter note speak harto which

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.530 
which are shorter note speak harto which
is<00:01:22.190> very<00:01:23.190> short<00:01:23.520> notes<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.430> throw<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.420> all

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is very short notes you can throw it all

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.540 
is very short notes you can throw it all
those<00:01:27.780> throw<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.410> bow<00:01:28.860> against<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
those throw the the bow against the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.609 
those throw the the bow against the
string<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.970> being<00:01:36.210> ricochet<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.200> bow<00:01:37.410> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
string this being ricochet the bow is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
string this being ricochet the bow is
made<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.880> balance<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:42.000> fact<00:01:42.300> if<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.570> find<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
made to balance in fact if I find the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.999 
made to balance in fact if I find the
right<00:01:43.050> balancing<00:01:43.770> spot<00:01:45.259> if<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.440> find<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> right

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
right balancing spot if I find the right

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.400 
right balancing spot if I find the right
spot<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.119> bow<00:01:48.300> will<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:50.210> balance<00:01:51.410> and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
spot the bow will actually balance and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.219 
spot the bow will actually balance and
it's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> very<00:01:52.920> slightly<00:01:53.250> different<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> oops

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
it's a very slightly different in oops

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.499 
it's a very slightly different in oops
very<00:01:55.229> slightly<00:01:55.530> different<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:56.220> each<00:01:56.580> bow<00:01:56.970> and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
very slightly different in each bow and

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.960 
very slightly different in each bow and
there<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.050> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.440> see<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.460> much

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
there so you can see that it's it's much

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.270 
there so you can see that it's it's much
heavier<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.660> end<00:02:03.869> than<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
heavier at this end than it is at that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.620 
heavier at this end than it is at that
end<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.070> get<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> point<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
end now if you if you get that point the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.750 
end now if you if you get that point the
bow<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.229> therefore<00:02:10.619> balance<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
bow will then therefore balance on the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.180 
bow will then therefore balance on the
string<00:02:12.060> without<00:02:12.350> me<00:02:13.350> needing<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.770> do<00:02:13.920> very

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
string without me needing to do very

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.789 
string without me needing to do very
much<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.610> with<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.209> right<00:02:15.420> hand<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
much with with my right hand and so the

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.500 
much with with my right hand and so the
right<00:02:16.920> hand<00:02:16.980> really<00:02:17.400> guides<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.060> bow<00:02:18.239> across

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
right hand really guides the bow across

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.610 
right hand really guides the bow across
the<00:02:18.870> strings<00:02:20.660> now<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.530> bow<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.220> made<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:25.500> very

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the strings now the bow is made is very

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.970 
the strings now the bow is made is very
bouncy<00:02:26.070> it's<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.549> very<00:02:26.730> sort<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.000> antsy<00:02:29.150> thing

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
bouncy it's a very sort of antsy thing

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.410 
bouncy it's a very sort of antsy thing
and<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:33.989> use<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:34.830> that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
and so you can you can use that but that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.020 
and so you can you can use that but that
natural<00:02:36.420> bounce<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.850> produce

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
natural bounce if you like to produce

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.170 
natural bounce if you like to produce
different<00:02:39.390> sounds<00:02:39.600> so
