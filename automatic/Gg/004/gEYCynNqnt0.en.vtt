00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.249
 and relate 

00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.110
 and we're going to talk about this energy before 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.790
 to observe beyond rock 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.289
 I made you euros or one of us is going to define this law 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.300
 and I say that it can be understood as soon as 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.780
 a spring in its natural length 'is pendent and from the ceiling of a room 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.699
 and you will then apply a force on its free end causing 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.849
 she undergoes a training that we will call the keys that is the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.719
 difference between the final length after deformation - the 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.170
 natural death 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.140
 when you apply this force deforming the love spring and argentina 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 trying to come back its full length 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.310
 this force we call force through art 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.010
 the forcel I think then second blocked by the product of constant khar 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.340
 stiffness of the spring by the deformation suffered by this fashion to the Taliban 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.070
 the museum maxxi high mmx 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.940
 we have then that our strength there I think is given by the product of our 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.350
 life constant escape 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.310
 the deformation x suffered by the hand 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.220
 note that burke's law a directly proportional relationship 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.770
 we will make a direct relation to this law and from there we will take 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.750
 two important properties including one of them 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 is pop the very definition of potential energy by art 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.070
 realize how the graph of this ours is 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.550
 cleide ro 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.060
 we have the graph that represents there force without function of ours 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.370
 training x 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.570
 is a straight line passing through the origin of the axes because they are directly 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 proportional 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700
 vertically we have the strength there shica caxias 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.090
 corresponding to the deformation x there horizontally 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.760
 pc will create the first property then 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.660
 coefficient veit one side that our house 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.260
 the tangent of the slope angle of the line is numerically equal 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.490
 capitu since it is our caches directed by the captain already feels that it is 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.190
 the training itself x 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.740
 cajias finger poles can simplify full taught underneath 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800
 hence our so urgent 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.880
 numerically equal to constant and latika with constant stiffness carr 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.950
 The second property is the very definition of potential energy by 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.440
 dry 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.439
 since if you calculate 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.549
 areas outside the chart 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.960
 training full prade 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.049
 her average work performed by the force there shica 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.279
 and this technical work given through its potential energy latium to 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.439
 energy can be there shica average capacity that this was I think the 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.079
 has to carry out this work then our energy laziness 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.689
 numerically equal to the area given by the base product by the author and 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.179
 divided by two 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.050
 the height 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.100
 I once escaped boxes 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.240
 bashir x 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.589
 divided by two 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:43.759
 cap 16 times and the boxes squared over two pipes synergy potential it 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.780
 the case then we have there defined the modalities of energy 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.939
 kinetic energy linked to motion 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.849
 and the potential linked to the positioning of a concept well 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.180
 important enough for us there is the system concept 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.169
 conservative that system where the mechanical energy remains constant the 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.529
 that will happen in this system, sometimes the potential to become kinetic 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.629
 another kinetic and becomes potential but the sum of these 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.210
 energies will keep 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.140
 always constant or for today that we have out only this 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.059
 I wait for you 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.469
 at our next meeting in our next class
