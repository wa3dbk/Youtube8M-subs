00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.809
 a little bit of coriander an onion that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.800
 I have h and oil for frying a 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.149
 little bit of pepper butt turmeric and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.239
 sea ​​salt so we will tear off our 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.070
 coup coral donations we will go in 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.200
 two times 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 so here I'm going to put half of the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.510
 turmeric half the salt half of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 tights or parsley that you have 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 missed the half look of my onions at 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:19.740
 the premiere of power the name here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.590
 get rid of my first part i'm going 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:38.540
 do the same for my second part 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:42.170
 turmeric moncel food mc oran onions 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.170
 still a little weight 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:54.880
 and go, so I put a product 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.530
 the heat is therefore at 170 ° so when I 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.450
 I realized I prepared so my 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.360
 flour but them I'm going to mix 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 of which calais calais and maja higher 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.860
 then the idea is to form 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.850
 small rooms then the time of the time 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.710
 a pretty shape when youtube form 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:25.990
 of the deviation we pass it in the flour 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.950
 then in the eyes and then we 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.950
 roll it in nature 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.510
 and position them I will give you 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.210
 a trick then is to put a 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.870
 little bit of turmeric in bread crumbs 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:55.900

 watchtower 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:12.880
 here we are not in the flour 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.980
 the eyes and in the shoe and we do 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.650
 this so on until we 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.840

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.620
 so do not wait for it's nuggets it's 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.620
 for adults we will start writing it 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.690
 we are careful not to burn ourselves well 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.810
 sure in summary about a minute of 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.130
 each side 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.400
 and if we want we can go to them 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.400

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.920
 we will put them on the list 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.050
