00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.810 
this or not but it can see in there just
but<00:01:46.570> basically<00:01:47.570> what<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.869> have<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.290> do<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:49.670> on

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
but basically what you have to do is on

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.680 
but basically what you have to do is on
these<00:01:50.030> trucks<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.540> have<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:51.910> get<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.030> cam<00:01:53.300> to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
these trucks you have to get the cam to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.710 
these trucks you have to get the cam to
its<00:01:53.840> low<00:01:54.140> position<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.660> install<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:58.720> so

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
its low position and install this so

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.510 
its low position and install this so
that<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.050> cam<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.619> on<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.130> top<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:04.130> rides<00:02:04.369> on

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
that the cam is on the top it rides on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.300 
that the cam is on the top it rides on
the<00:02:04.670> top<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.380> push<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.650> up<00:02:06.979> under

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
the top of that and you push it up under

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.540 
the top of that and you push it up under
the<00:02:07.340> cam<00:02:08.080> cams<00:02:09.080> not<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> low<00:02:09.709> position<00:02:09.890> you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
the cam cams not in the low position you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.759 
the cam cams not in the low position you
end<00:02:10.729> up<00:02:12.700> squishing<00:02:14.170> squishing<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.560> there

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
end up squishing squishing it in there

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.420 
end up squishing squishing it in there
and<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.160> will<00:02:16.459> break<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:19.040> pivot

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and it will break the little pivot

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.170 
and it will break the little pivot
points<00:02:19.790> there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
points there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.400 
points there
so<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.110> have<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.470> do<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.860> right<00:02:23.080> not<00:02:24.080> really

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
so you have to do this right not really

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.310 
so you have to do this right not really
any<00:02:24.560> shortcut<00:02:25.040> there<00:02:25.630> all<00:02:26.630> right<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.810> had<00:02:27.170> to

any shortcut there all right I had to
show<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860

going<00:03:03.709> on<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.579> I<00:03:05.350> went<00:03:06.350> ahead<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.459> went

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
going on here so I went ahead so I went

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.470 
going on here so I went ahead so I went
ahead<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:18.280> found<00:03:19.280> me<00:03:19.549> another<00:03:19.760> mirror<00:03:20.209> that

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
ahead and found me another mirror that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.720 
ahead and found me another mirror that
was<00:03:20.600> big<00:03:20.840> enough<00:03:22.750> see<00:03:23.950> what<00:03:24.950> was<00:03:25.070> going<00:03:25.340> on<00:03:25.459> in

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
was big enough see what was going on in

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:42.429 
was big enough see what was going on in
here<00:03:26.060> now<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.390> didn't<00:03:26.750> even<00:03:26.870> begin<00:03:27.260> but

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.520 

all<00:03:43.439> righty<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.909> right<00:03:45.060> now<00:03:45.420> if<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.079> look<00:03:46.290> in

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
all righty all right now if you look in

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:58.209 
all righty all right now if you look in
there<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:52.370> can<00:03:53.370> see<00:03:54.859> about<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.920> one<00:03:56.219> inch<00:03:56.459> wide

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
there you can see about a one inch wide

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.309 
there you can see about a one inch wide
machined<00:03:59.219> surface<00:03:59.730> now<00:04:00.629> that<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.109> low

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
machined surface now that is the low

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.869 
machined surface now that is the low
point<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.909> the<00:04:02.909> cam<00:04:03.650> now<00:04:04.650> try<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.370> zoom<00:04:05.609> in<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
point of the cam now try to zoom in the

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.440 
point of the cam now try to zoom in the
camera<00:04:05.909> see<00:04:06.389> see<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> little<00:04:07.019> bit<00:04:07.109> there<00:04:07.319> but

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
camera see see a little bit there but

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.940 
camera see see a little bit there but
this<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.650> very<00:04:10.650> awkward

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.870 

all<00:04:13.950> right<00:04:14.329> you<00:04:15.329> see<00:04:15.599> there<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:20.400> about<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.609> one

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
all right you see there it's about a one

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.830 
all right you see there it's about a one
inch<00:04:21.090> wide<00:04:21.329> machined<00:04:21.870> surface<00:04:22.440> there<00:04:22.729> and

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
inch wide machined surface there and

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.650 
inch wide machined surface there and
when<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.930> cam<00:04:25.169> comes<00:04:25.440> around<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.759> the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
when the cam comes around to the the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.480 
when the cam comes around to the the
high<00:04:27.870> side<00:04:28.820> it's<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.479> half<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.080> width<00:04:31.490> so

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
high side it's it's half that width so

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.390 
high side it's it's half that width so
that's<00:04:32.699> how<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:32.909> know<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:34.470> gets<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.919> half<00:04:35.130> that

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
that's how you know it gets to half that

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.080 
that's how you know it gets to half that
width<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:36.780> other<00:04:36.930> half<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.500> flat<00:04:38.090> that's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
width and the other half is flat that's

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.020 
width and the other half is flat that's
the<00:04:39.360> high<00:04:39.570> side<00:04:39.949> you<00:04:40.949> want<00:04:41.190> one<00:04:41.610> inch<00:04:41.820> wide

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the high side you want one inch wide

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.350 
the high side you want one inch wide
machined<00:04:42.570> surface<00:04:43.020> it's<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.440> low<00:04:43.650> side<00:04:44.360> right

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
machined surface it's the low side right

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.500 
machined surface it's the low side right
there<00:04:47.659> okay

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
there okay

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.450 
there okay
I'm<00:04:51.510> not<00:04:51.780> gonna<00:04:51.930> lie<00:04:52.110> it's<00:04:52.290> an<00:04:52.380> absolute<00:04:53.220> pain

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
I'm not gonna lie it's an absolute pain

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.520 
I'm not gonna lie it's an absolute pain

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.480 

well<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:18.090> think<00:05:18.420> it<00:05:18.660> used<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.020> be<00:05:19.170> red<00:05:20.160> I'm<00:05:20.340> not

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
well I think it used to be red I'm not

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.520 
well I think it used to be red I'm not
really<00:05:20.670> sure<00:05:20.910> red<00:05:21.270> black<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.600> this<00:05:21.960> is<00:05:22.140> what

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
really sure red black and this is what

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.830 
really sure red black and this is what
it<00:05:22.620> looks<00:05:22.800> like<00:05:22.890> but<00:05:23.240> anyways<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.420> goes<00:05:24.570> there

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
it looks like but anyways it goes there

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.760 
it looks like but anyways it goes there
and<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:26.610> just<00:05:26.640> touch<00:05:27.090> from<00:05:27.330> here<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.660> here<00:05:27.900> and

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
and you just touch from here to here and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.390 
and you just touch from here to here and
that<00:05:28.980> jumps<00:05:29.370> over<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.610> starter<00:05:30.350> without

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
that jumps over the starter without

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.680 
that jumps over the starter without
putting<00:05:32.400> power<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.880> that<00:05:33.000> switch<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.300> want<00:05:33.600> to

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
putting power to that switch you want to

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.100 
putting power to that switch you want to
leave<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.990> ignition<00:05:34.440> off<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.900> won't

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
leave the ignition off and it won't

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.590 
leave the ignition off and it won't
start

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
start

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.940 
start
well<00:05:39.600> obviously<00:05:39.690> won't<00:05:40.260> start<00:05:40.560> because<00:05:40.830> it's

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
well obviously won't start because it's

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.990 
well obviously won't start because it's
not<00:05:41.070> going<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.280> get<00:05:41.400> any<00:05:41.550> feel<00:05:41.760> pressure

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
not going to get any feel pressure

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.150 
not going to get any feel pressure
anyways<00:05:42.420> without<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:42.720> feel<00:05:42.930> pump<00:05:43.140> right<00:05:44.000> so

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
anyways without a feel pump right so

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.830 
anyways without a feel pump right so
there<00:05:47.160> you<00:05:47.280> go<00:05:48.470> now<00:05:49.470> I<00:05:49.500> guess<00:05:49.800> go<00:05:50.160> ahead<00:05:50.400> and

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
there you go now I guess go ahead and

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.470 
there you go now I guess go ahead and
sell<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.050> pump<00:05:52.320> now<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:56.270> show<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.300> how<00:05:57.420> she

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
sell that pump now and show you how she

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.830 
sell that pump now and show you how she
starts<00:05:58.850> alrighty<00:05:59.850> so<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.120> got<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.390> fill<00:06:00.600> pump

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
starts alrighty so I got the fill pump

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.760 
starts alrighty so I got the fill pump

hopefully what that will do is let most

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.930 
hopefully what that will do is let most
