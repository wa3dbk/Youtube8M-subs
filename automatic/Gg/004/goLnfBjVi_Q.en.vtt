build<00:00:33.680> it<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:34.460> realized<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.120> hey<00:00:35.360> if<00:00:35.540> I

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
build it and I realized that hey if I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.210 
build it and I realized that hey if I
could<00:00:35.989> build<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.620> could<00:00:36.800> start<00:00:37.040> that

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
could build this I could start that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.500 
could build this I could start that
company<00:00:37.430> but<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:37.820> don't<00:00:38.059> have<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.330> knowledge

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
company but I don't have the knowledge

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.960 
company but I don't have the knowledge
to<00:00:39.230> build<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.739> as<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.400> try<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.640> seek<00:00:40.940> that

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
to build it and as I try to seek that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.640 
to build it and as I try to seek that
knowledge<00:00:41.449> everything<00:00:41.720> kept<00:00:42.110> pointing<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.620> a

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
knowledge everything kept pointing to a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.170 
knowledge everything kept pointing to a
computer<00:00:43.129> engineering<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.699> speak<00:00:44.000> so

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
computer engineering so to speak so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.000 
computer engineering so to speak so
that's<00:00:44.839> kind<00:00:45.080> of<00:00:45.110> where<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.290> energy<00:00:45.559> came

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
that's kind of where that energy came

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.250 
that's kind of where that energy came
from<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.400> said<00:00:46.580> well<00:00:46.820> maybe<00:00:47.659> one<00:00:48.019> day

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
from and said well maybe one day

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.079 
from and said well maybe one day
initially<00:00:48.739> monk<00:00:49.100> thought<00:00:49.400> was<00:00:49.550> maybe<00:00:49.790> if<00:00:49.970> I

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
initially monk thought was maybe if I

advanced degree while working and I

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.840 
advanced degree while working and I
remember<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.620> sophomore<00:01:31.070> as<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.730> was

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
remember as a sophomore as I was

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.400 
remember as a sophomore as I was
speaking<00:01:32.060> one<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.330> my<00:01:32.390> professors<00:01:32.960> about

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
speaking one of my professors about

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.930 
speaking one of my professors about
going<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.890> get<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.190> PA<00:01:34.960> MBA<00:01:35.960> he<00:01:36.950> kind<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.700> looked

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
going to get a PA MBA he kind of looked

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.180 
going to get a PA MBA he kind of looked
at<00:01:38.120> me<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.360> said<00:01:38.630> well<00:01:38.870> you<00:01:39.170> may<00:01:39.860> want<00:01:40.100> you

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
at me and said well you may want you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.680 
at me and said well you may want you
might<00:01:40.400> want<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.670> get<00:01:40.760> an<00:01:40.850> MBA<00:01:41.150> but<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.450> think

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
might want to get an MBA but I think

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.520 
might want to get an MBA but I think
you'll<00:01:41.810> be<00:01:41.930> doing<00:01:42.140> yourself<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.500> disservice

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you'll be doing yourself a disservice

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.190 
you'll be doing yourself a disservice
just<00:01:43.460> by<00:01:43.610> getting<00:01:44.120> an<00:01:44.270> MD<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.600> could<00:01:44.870> see<00:01:44.990> as<00:01:45.170> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
just by getting an MD I could see as a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.530 
just by getting an MD I could see as a
PhD<00:01:45.560> candidate<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.460> at<00:01:46.910> that<00:01:47.090> time<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.360> never

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
PhD candidate and at that time I never

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.930 
PhD candidate and at that time I never
really<00:01:48.050> considered<00:01:48.260> that<00:01:48.680> but<00:01:49.400> just<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.700> know

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
really considered that but just to know

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.060 
really considered that but just to know
that<00:01:50.090> somebody<00:01:50.420> else<00:01:50.480> believed<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.590> saw<00:01:51.860> me

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
that somebody else believed and saw me

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.970 
that somebody else believed and saw me
as<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.300> prominent<00:01:53.300> scholar<00:01:53.540> made<00:01:54.320> me<00:01:54.590> want<00:01:54.890> to

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
as a prominent scholar made me want to

close relationship that our faculty have

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.010 
close relationship that our faculty have
with<00:02:00.530> our<00:02:00.650> students<00:02:01.150> naturally<00:02:02.150> leads<00:02:02.540> to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
with our students naturally leads to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.160 
with our students naturally leads to
those<00:02:03.650> inquisitive<00:02:04.550> students<00:02:05.120> coming<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.930> as

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
those inquisitive students coming on as

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.169 
those inquisitive students coming on as
undergraduate<00:02:06.650> researchers<00:02:07.430> with<00:02:07.909> those

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
undergraduate researchers with those

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.839 
undergraduate researchers with those
faculty<00:02:08.509> members<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.769> has<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> wonderful

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
faculty members and that has a wonderful

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.720 
faculty members and that has a wonderful
way<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.450> having<00:02:11.900> those<00:02:12.170> students<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:12.890> pursue

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
way of having those students then pursue

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.089 
way of having those students then pursue
graduate<00:02:14.269> degrees<00:02:14.659> and<00:02:14.690> that's<00:02:15.019> why<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.890> many

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
graduate degrees and that's why so many

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.759 
graduate degrees and that's why so many
of<00:02:16.220> our<00:02:16.430> students<00:02:16.940> go<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.659> fact<00:02:17.959> recent

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
of our students go on in fact recent

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.009 
of our students go on in fact recent
statistics<00:02:19.340> show<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.550> about<00:02:19.879> 1/3<00:02:20.180> 33

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
statistics show that about 1/3 33

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.910 
statistics show that about 1/3 33
percent<00:02:21.469> of<00:02:21.590> our<00:02:22.010> undergraduates

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
percent of our undergraduates

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.699 
percent of our undergraduates
let's<00:02:23.099> go<00:02:23.250> directly<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> masters<00:02:25.560> or

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
let's go directly on for a masters or

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.979 
let's go directly on for a masters or
PhD<00:02:25.950> degree<00:02:26.459> once<00:02:26.970> completing<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> bachelor's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
PhD degree once completing a bachelor's

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.320 
PhD degree once completing a bachelor's
degree<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:29.069> those<00:02:29.310> students<00:02:29.730> who<00:02:29.849> are<00:02:29.880> driven

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
degree so those students who are driven

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.309 
degree so those students who are driven
to<00:02:30.800> achieve<00:02:31.800> are<00:02:32.520> some<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.030> our<00:02:33.150> best<00:02:33.690> students

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
to achieve are some of our best students

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.589 
to achieve are some of our best students
because<00:02:35.069> they<00:02:35.280> understand<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.239> they<00:02:36.569> are

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
because they understand that they are

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.470 
because they understand that they are
here<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.130> quality<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> education

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
here for the quality of the education

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.350 
here for the quality of the education
that<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.630> offer<00:02:39.900> but<00:02:40.770> that's<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:41.280> enough<00:02:41.580> they

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that we offer but that's not enough they

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.720 
that we offer but that's not enough they
are<00:02:42.420> also<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.560> blend<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.069> quality<00:02:44.640> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
are also here to blend that quality of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.040 
are also here to blend that quality of
their<00:02:44.880> technical<00:02:45.270> education<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.900> engineering

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
their technical education in engineering

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.729 
their technical education in engineering
or<00:02:46.620> computer<00:02:47.100> science<00:02:47.640> with<00:02:48.330> their<00:02:49.050> talents

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
or computer science with their talents

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.460 
or computer science with their talents
as<00:02:49.860> people<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.150> when<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.569> combine<00:02:51.930> those<00:02:52.170> two

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
as people so when you combine those two

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.690 
as people so when you combine those two
things<00:02:52.500> those<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> things<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.489> we're

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
things those are the things that we're

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.240 
things those are the things that we're
nurturing<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.959> find<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.440> those<00:02:55.800> students

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
nurturing so we find that those students

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
nurturing so we find that those students
who<00:02:56.340> understand<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.209> their<00:02:57.600> leadership

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
who understand that their leadership

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
who understand that their leadership
matters<00:02:58.800> now<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.790> doesn't<00:03:00.090> mean<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.330> there's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
matters now it doesn't mean that there's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.840 
matters now it doesn't mean that there's
never<00:03:00.930> anything<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.650> may<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.280> difficult

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
never anything that may be a difficult

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.640 
never anything that may be a difficult
for<00:03:03.060> them<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.299> their<00:03:03.420> curriculum<00:03:03.569> that's<00:03:04.230> okay

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
for them in their curriculum that's okay

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.330 
for them in their curriculum that's okay
the<00:03:05.370> point<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.120> they<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:08.040> with

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the point is that they know that with

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.490 
the point is that they know that with
putting<00:03:08.700> more<00:03:08.940> effort<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.290> really

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
putting more effort in and and really

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.030 
putting more effort in and and really
figuring<00:03:11.400> out<00:03:11.580> how<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.590> transcend<00:03:13.590> beyond

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
figuring out how to transcend beyond

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.490 
figuring out how to transcend beyond
anything<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> makes<00:03:15.239> them<00:03:15.420> stumble<00:03:15.690> they'll

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
anything that makes them stumble they'll

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.890 
anything that makes them stumble they'll
know<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.100> they<00:03:17.430> are<00:03:17.580> able<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.000> deliver<00:03:18.420> to

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
know that they are able to deliver to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.600 
know that they are able to deliver to
the<00:03:19.019> highest<00:03:19.260> level<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:19.920> those<00:03:20.340> are<00:03:20.549> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the highest level and those are the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.850 
the highest level and those are the

you'll have a voice that will be heard
the<00:03:28.230> students<00:03:28.680> actually<00:03:29.720> circulated<00:03:30.720> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the students actually circulated a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.420 
the students actually circulated a
petition<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.519> said<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:33.090> want<00:03:33.359> an<00:03:34.430> opportunity

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
petition and said we want an opportunity

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.199 
petition and said we want an opportunity
to<00:03:36.120> work<00:03:36.390> with<00:03:37.010> robotics<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.820> College<00:03:39.090> of

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
to work with robotics in the College of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.840 
to work with robotics in the College of
Engineering<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:40.829> took<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.100> petition

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
Engineering and so we took that petition

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.449 
Engineering and so we took that petition
we<00:03:42.450> said<00:03:42.750> we're<00:03:42.989> gonna<00:03:43.109> run<00:03:43.410> with<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.829> we<00:03:44.250> gave

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
we said we're gonna run with it we gave

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.000 
we said we're gonna run with it we gave
