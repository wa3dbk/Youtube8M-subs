00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
screw-ups okay so I'm pretty sure at

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
screw-ups okay so I'm pretty sure at
least<00:00:45.440> I'm<00:00:46.440> pretty<00:00:46.770> sure<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> most

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
least I'm pretty sure that's the most

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
least I'm pretty sure that's the most
obvious<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.930> hadn't<00:00:49.200> figured<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
obvious some if you hadn't figured it

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.639 
obvious some if you hadn't figured it
out<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.010> obviously<00:00:50.579> Terrell<00:00:51.120> Owens

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
out that's obviously Terrell Owens

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.560 
out that's obviously Terrell Owens
cancer<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> locker<00:00:53.070> room<00:00:53.250> hey<00:00:53.969> everyone

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
cancer in the locker room hey everyone

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.950

he<00:00:54.750> blamed<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.410> else<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.770> screw-ups<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
he blamed that one else for screw-ups I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.330

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
think Terrell Owens has gotten over that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
think Terrell Owens has gotten over that
since<00:00:59.850> he<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.090> sent<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> Buffalo<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.289> I

game it says you have to score them I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.539 
game it says you have to score them I
don't<00:02:01.259> remember<00:02:01.409> how<00:02:01.679> many<00:02:01.710> touchdowns<00:02:01.979> but

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.080 
don't remember how many touchdowns but
it's<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:04.130> three<00:02:05.130> touchdowns<00:02:05.610> i'm<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:05.909> sure

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it's like three touchdowns i'm not sure

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's like three touchdowns i'm not sure
if<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.360> count<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.910> i'm<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.030> sure<00:02:09.090> if

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
if they count it as it i'm not sure if

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.449 
if they count it as it i'm not sure if
they<00:02:09.479> count<00:02:09.750> passing<00:02:10.170> touchdowns<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.400> i'm

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
they count passing touchdowns so i'm

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.770 
they count passing touchdowns so i'm
just<00:02:11.519> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:11.910> three<00:02:12.150> straight<00:02:12.390> rushing

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.130 
just going to get three straight rushing
touchdowns<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:13.530> fast<00:02:14.870> because<00:02:15.870> i'm<00:02:15.959> not

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
touchdowns pretty fast because i'm not

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.110 
touchdowns pretty fast because i'm not
sure<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.769> physically<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.610> score<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.000> or

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
sure you physically have to score it or

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:32.380 
sure you physically have to score it or
it's<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:19.500> team<00:02:19.769> has<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.250> score

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.040 

so<00:02:33.460> that<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.700> didn't<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.420> great<00:02:35.810> that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
so that I didn't get it great that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:03:02.830
