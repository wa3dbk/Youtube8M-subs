00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
momentum with we're not an unbeaten run

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
momentum with we're not an unbeaten run
and<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.450> wins<00:02:09.630> if<00:02:09.750> possible<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.709> do

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and some wins if possible and if you do

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.199 
and some wins if possible and if you do
change<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.310> two<00:02:11.489> senior<00:02:11.790> players<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
gives that's coming in the chance to

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.590 
gives that's coming in the chance to
perhaps<00:02:13.890> stake<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> claim<00:02:14.519> if<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
perhaps stake a claim if not for the

difficult<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.370> play<00:03:11.489> against<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.329> how

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
difficult to play against and how

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.140 
difficult to play against and how
important<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.870> view<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.079> cup<00:03:13.319> run<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.650> mean

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
important do you view a cup run I mean

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.580 
important do you view a cup run I mean
so<00:03:14.269> I'm<00:03:14.329> had<00:03:14.510> one<00:03:14.659> for<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.840> number<00:03:14.959> years<00:03:15.079> before

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
so I'm had one for a number years before

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.289 
so I'm had one for a number years before
your<00:03:15.739> time<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.189> it<00:03:16.280> something<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.640> can<00:03:16.939> go

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
your time is it something that can go

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.610 
your time is it something that can go
hand<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.629> hand<00:03:17.689> with<00:03:17.870> success<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.409> the<00:03:18.470> league

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.080 
hand in hand with success in the league
I<00:03:18.769> think<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.099> is<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.250> think<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.730> we<00:03:19.849> should<00:03:19.879> be

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
I think it is I think that we should be

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.699 
I think it is I think that we should be
settled<00:03:20.360> enough<00:03:20.629> now<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.870> change<00:03:21.200> one<00:03:21.470> or<00:03:21.500> two

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
settled enough now to change one or two

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.289 
settled enough now to change one or two
