00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello I hope you are very well I am 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.510
 dani and in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.040
 do a craft with a technique 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.990
 much different from the materials 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 different also and how I'm from 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.919
 vacation with my family I said to force 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.140
 I have to do video because you know 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.060
 I do two turns a week and then 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.539
 this video is a bit short it is a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 little bit simpleton but I still hope so 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.970
 that you like it a lot and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.399
 how is it 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.680
 the first thing you need is a proofreader 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.590
 for pens or liquid paper or I do not know how 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.199
 you tell him you also water a brush 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.210
 and a container with water is now going to 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.980
 take you sketchbook wipe where 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.570
 you want to do this drawing and you're going to 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.820
 start to trace the figure that you 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.699
 want me as always you already know that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.110
 I make mandalas is not angular but you 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.760
 you can do what you want any 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.430
 true type of drawing will look 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.500
 incredible or well he also writes a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.180
 phrase that you really like a word 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.860
 some name whatever whatever it is of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.920
 true this serves with whatever it is that 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.930
 you want and because my intention was to fill 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.500
 the whole sheet of mandalas but the truth 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.390
 is that I had an accident I do not know what happened 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.880
 but well I do know what happened what happened 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.530
 it was that my liquid paper was over and so 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.479
 I can not do it 13 but good now 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.790
 Take your watercolors, since it is dry 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.409
 liquid paper takes all its watercolors and 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.299
 start painting as you want you can 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.920
 be a single color of many colors 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.700
 I wanted it to be many colors 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.579
 so that it will still stand out a lot more 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.820
 this is the effect that gives imaxe that looks 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.219
 incredible although this second idea is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.570
 with a crayon called dixon that 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.460
 I remember that was what my 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.939
 teachers qualified me when I went in 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.069
 primary and then again the same thing you have 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.220
 to go drawing as you want, I did 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:53.130
 a mandala like in half and I filled almost 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.259
 the whole sheet and then when it's over 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 I did exactly what it was with 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729
 my watercolors began to paint like me 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.590
 I wanted and heard if you encourage to do 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 some of these drawings know that I 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.569
 can share can upload your photo 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.549
 instagram and write good write 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.280
 write my name if you want or carve 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.870
 me or label me and teach me how 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 do you also for twitter me 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 can you write on twitter teach me 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.230
 I would love to see how you 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.420
 is any of these drawings are very 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.280
 easy to make 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.410
 you have to have like patience 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840
 the layout and you're going to see what's going to 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.480
 Be amazing, it will also relax you 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.860
 very much is going to clear your mind and the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 I really love drawing when 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.060
 I'm a little stressed out as 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.620
 Anguished my family and my friends know 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.750
 that when I'm sad when I'm 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.260
 angry I get to draw points is what 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.260
 only I do 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.210
 I hope you liked this idea of 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.240
 making mandalas is a very technical 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.370
