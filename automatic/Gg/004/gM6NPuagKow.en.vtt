not<00:00:00.210> long<00:00:00.420> ago<00:00:00.570> I<00:00:00.719> I<00:00:01.230> talked<00:00:01.530> with<00:00:01.650> Neil

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
not long ago I I talked with Neil

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.550 
not long ago I I talked with Neil
Armstrong<00:00:02.460> about<00:00:02.820> basically<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.899> dream<00:00:04.200> that

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
Armstrong about basically the dream that

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.650 
Armstrong about basically the dream that
will<00:00:04.710> climax<00:00:05.069> with<00:00:05.520> Apollo<00:00:05.850> 11<00:00:11.660> you're

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
will climax with Apollo 11 you're

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.410 
will climax with Apollo 11 you're
supposed<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.590> are<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> pilot<00:00:14.340> not<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
supposed to be and you are a pilot not a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.900 
supposed to be and you are a pilot not a
philosopher<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
philosopher but you are going to be the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
philosopher but you are going to be the
first<00:00:18.090> man<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.390> land<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> moon<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.650> must

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
first man to land on the moon you must

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.439 
first man to land on the moon you must
have<00:00:19.980> thought<00:00:20.160> well<00:00:20.430> beyond<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.970> technical

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
have thought well beyond the technical

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
have thought well beyond the technical
purely<00:00:22.109> scientific<00:00:22.320> aspects<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> this

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
purely scientific aspects of this

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.609 
purely scientific aspects of this
mission<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> ask<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
mission so I want to ask you really a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.140 
mission so I want to ask you really a
kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.070> impossible<00:00:26.609> question<00:00:26.730> but

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
kind of an impossible question but

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.120 
kind of an impossible question but
you're<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> man<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.960> give<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> answers<00:00:28.560> what

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you're the man to give the answers what

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.290 
you're the man to give the answers what
do<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> think<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.580> mission<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:30.090> tell<00:00:30.269> us

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
do you think this mission will tell us

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
do you think this mission will tell us
about<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.929> Batman<00:00:33.140> police<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.890> successfully

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
about the Batman police are successfully

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850 
about the Batman police are successfully
able<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> execute<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.660> touchdown<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.230> return

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
able to execute a touchdown in return

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.690 
able to execute a touchdown in return
it's<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> give<00:00:39.120> us<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:40.700> unmeasurable

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's going to give us the unmeasurable

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.119 
it's going to give us the unmeasurable
amount<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> confidence<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.020> guess<00:00:43.920> probably

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
amount of confidence I guess probably

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.330

the<00:00:44.460> greatest<00:00:44.640> result<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> flight<00:00:46.410> it's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the greatest result of the flight it's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.540 
the greatest result of the flight it's
going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.230> assure<00:00:49.230> those<00:00:49.469> those<00:00:50.010> people<00:00:50.430> who

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
going to assure those those people who

kind of a program and find ways to apply
those<00:02:01.760> approaches<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.540> two<00:02:03.170> other<00:02:03.380> problems<00:02:03.980> I

those approaches to two other problems I

those approaches to two other problems I
don't<00:02:07.220> necessarily<00:02:07.370> agree<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:09.429> just

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
don't necessarily agree that just

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.600 
don't necessarily agree that just
because<00:02:10.820> these<00:02:11.330> people<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:12.080> been<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:13.370> this

in this approach have been successful

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.830 
in this approach have been successful
that<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:18.230> should<00:02:19.100> take<00:02:19.910> their<00:02:20.090> resources<00:02:20.600> away

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that we should take their resources away

that we should take their resources away
from<00:02:20.990> them<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.650> give<00:02:21.800> them<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.980> some<00:02:22.910> other

people living less accessible in their
endeavors<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:26.950> got<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> impression<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.400> think

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
endeavors I got the impression you think

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.060 
endeavors I got the impression you think
we<00:02:28.730> might<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:28.910> able<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.150> do<00:02:29.300> both<00:02:30.040> well<00:02:31.040> I

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
we might be able to do both well I
