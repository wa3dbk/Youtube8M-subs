elements that help enhance that he'll
lock<00:00:54.440> for<00:00:55.039> example<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.519> first<00:00:55.729> one<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.059> the

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
lock for example the first one is the

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.270 
lock for example the first one is the
pump<00:00:56.390> technology<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:57.769> way<00:00:57.920> we've<00:00:58.100> designed

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
pump technology the way we've designed

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.069 
pump technology the way we've designed
the<00:00:58.640> pump<00:00:58.879> we<00:00:59.030> move<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.390> pump<00:00:59.629> ball<00:00:59.809> back

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
the pump we move the pump ball back

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.379 
the pump we move the pump ball back
about<00:01:00.409> a<00:01:00.469> half<00:01:00.769> an<00:01:00.979> inch<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.429> within<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
about a half an inch and within the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.360 
about a half an inch and within the
construction<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.289> skate<00:01:03.589> when<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.129> pump

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
construction of skate when the pump

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.789 
construction of skate when the pump
bladders<00:01:04.760> inflate<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.780> really<00:01:06.110> locks<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.560> heal

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
bladders inflate it really locks to heal

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.190 
bladders inflate it really locks to heal
in<00:01:06.950> place<00:01:07.189> well<00:01:07.460> that's<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.689> second<00:01:09.079> element

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
in place well that's the second element

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.280 
in place well that's the second element
we've<00:01:09.500> got<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> dual<00:01:10.670> zone<00:01:10.909> liner<00:01:11.240> here<00:01:11.659> where

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
we've got a dual zone liner here where

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.980 
we've got a dual zone liner here where
the<00:01:12.469> back<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:13.159> attacking<00:01:13.790> ash<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:14.869> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
the back is attacking ash and what the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.190 
the back is attacking ash and what the
tacking<00:01:15.409> ash<00:01:15.590> does<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.610> allows<00:01:16.969> that<00:01:17.329> sock<00:01:17.869> and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
tacking ash does it allows that sock and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.080 
tacking ash does it allows that sock and
that<00:01:18.439> flourished<00:01:18.799> foot<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.369> really<00:01:19.640> lock<00:01:19.850> in

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
that flourished foot to really lock in

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.730 
that flourished foot to really lock in
wall<00:01:20.329> when<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.719> players<00:01:20.960> fit<00:01:21.259> inside<00:01:21.409> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
wall when the players fit inside the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.010 
wall when the players fit inside the
boot<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.789> we've<00:01:23.090> really<00:01:23.360> done<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.539> few<00:01:23.750> elements

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
boot so we've really done a few elements

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.440 
boot so we've really done a few elements
to<00:01:24.380> lock<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.979> skate<00:01:25.219> in<00:01:25.369> place<00:01:25.579> and<00:01:25.880> also<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
to lock the skate in place and also the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.029 
to lock the skate in place and also the
the<00:01:26.719> pump<00:01:26.960> feature<00:01:27.170> has<00:01:27.409> changed<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.890> little

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
the pump feature has changed a little

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.260 
the pump feature has changed a little
bit<00:01:28.159> on<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.399> guy<00:01:28.579> as<00:01:28.700> well<00:01:28.729> right<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.210> mean

to<00:01:32.659> do<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.259> enhance<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.829> pump<00:01:34.100> by

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
to do is really enhance the pump by

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.399 
to do is really enhance the pump by
making<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.969> little<00:01:35.119> bit<00:01:35.299> lower<00:01:35.450> profile<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.320> it

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
making a little bit lower profile so it

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.620 
making a little bit lower profile so it
sticks<00:01:36.619> out<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.859> little<00:01:36.950> less<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.060> at<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.420> same

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
sticks out a little less but at the same

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.539 
sticks out a little less but at the same
time<00:01:38.840> increase<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.469> air<00:01:39.590> flow<00:01:39.619> within<00:01:40.250> the

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
time increase the air flow within the

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.999 
time increase the air flow within the
skate<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:41.719> by<00:01:41.869> moving<00:01:42.079> it<00:01:42.350> back<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.590> playing

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
skate so by moving it back and playing

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.230 
skate so by moving it back and playing
with<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.280> air<00:01:43.399> bladders<00:01:43.789> a<00:01:43.820> little<00:01:44.119> bit

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
with the air bladders a little bit

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.669 
with the air bladders a little bit
you're<00:01:44.329> gonna<00:01:44.450> get<00:01:44.659> greater<00:01:44.930> airflow<00:01:45.409> inside

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
you're gonna get greater airflow inside

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.370 
you're gonna get greater airflow inside
the<00:01:46.009> pump<00:01:46.219> okay<00:01:46.759> great<00:01:47.210> um<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.109> then<00:01:48.200> also

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
the pump okay great um and then also

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.980 
the pump okay great um and then also
under<00:01:48.740> tell<00:01:48.979> us<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.159> little<00:01:49.310> bit<00:01:49.460> about<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.869> new

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
under tell us a little bit about the new

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.349 
under tell us a little bit about the new
quarter<00:01:51.289> package<00:01:51.679> here<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.100> side<00:01:52.359> well

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
quarter package here on the side well

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.260 
quarter package here on the side well
another<00:01:53.810> innovation<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.280> had<00:01:55.490> over<00:01:56.240> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
another innovation that we had over the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.300 
another innovation that we had over the
years<00:01:56.359> we've<00:01:56.869> been

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
years we've been

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.350 
years we've been
creating<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.370> skate<00:01:58.640> were<00:01:58.760> many<00:01:58.970> different

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
creating a skate were many different

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.690 
creating a skate were many different
layers<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.840> reinforcements<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.220> what<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:01.550> did

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
layers of reinforcements so what we did

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.100 
layers of reinforcements so what we did
we<00:02:01.910> were<00:02:02.030> able<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.330> find<00:02:02.570> this<00:02:02.660> great<00:02:02.960> new

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
we were able to find this great new

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.110 
we were able to find this great new
competent<00:02:03.710> material<00:02:04.100> easily<00:02:04.520> understandable

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
competent material easily understandable

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.200 
competent material easily understandable
by<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.420> consumer<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.770> reinforces<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.850> skate

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
by the consumer that reinforces a skate

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.749 
by the consumer that reinforces a skate
in<00:02:08.330> three<00:02:08.540> specific<00:02:08.780> areas<00:02:09.259> in<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.250> forefoot

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
in three specific areas in the forefoot

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.640 
in three specific areas in the forefoot
the<00:02:11.180> great<00:02:11.390> part<00:02:11.660> about<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:11.990> comp<00:02:12.260> said<00:02:12.500> it's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the great part about this comp said it's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.250 
the great part about this comp said it's
also<00:02:12.830> thermal<00:02:13.520> formal<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.180> then<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
also thermal formal and then we have the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.170 
also thermal formal and then we have the
embedded<00:02:15.710> Compeyson<00:02:16.130> area<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.640> deflection

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
embedded Compeyson area the deflection

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.540 
embedded Compeyson area the deflection
zone<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.380> back<00:02:18.560> tendon<00:02:18.980> area<00:02:19.280> which

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
zone and the back tendon area which

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.610 
zone and the back tendon area which
allows<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.360> increase<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.810> flexion<00:02:21.140> profile

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
allows to increase the flexion profile

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.800 
allows to increase the flexion profile
great<00:02:22.220> yeah<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.730> mean<00:02:23.000> definitely<00:02:23.240> has<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.600> nice

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
great yeah I mean definitely has a nice

great yeah I mean definitely has a nice
nice<00:02:24.140> look<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:25.490> what<00:02:25.670> you've<00:02:25.790> done<00:02:25.820> on

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
nice look to it like what you've done on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.090 
nice look to it like what you've done on
it<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.960> then<00:02:27.260> also<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.530> believe<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.860> guys<00:02:27.950> are

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
it and then also I believe you guys are

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.770 
it and then also I believe you guys are
also<00:02:28.250> coming<00:02:28.700> out<00:02:28.880> with<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> new<00:02:29.240> size

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
also coming out with a new size

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.480 
also coming out with a new size
available<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> 11th<00:02:30.800> k<00:02:30.890> as<00:02:30.980> well<00:02:31.160> that's

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
available for the 11th k as well that's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.790 
available for the 11th k as well that's
right<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.970> enhance<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.630> he'll<00:02:32.959> lock<00:02:33.170> well

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
right to enhance that he'll lock well

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.740 
right to enhance that he'll lock well
we've<00:02:33.980> created<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.459> new<00:02:34.550> size<00:02:34.970> which<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.480> d

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
we've created a new size which is a d

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.840 
we've created a new size which is a d
double<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:36.920> we've<00:02:37.100> added<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.760> our

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
double a so we've added that to our

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.430 
double a so we've added that to our
skate<00:02:38.120> line<00:02:38.330> which<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> heel<00:02:39.170> that's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
skate line which is a heel that's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.080 
skate line which is a heel that's
approximately<00:02:39.709> two<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.340> half<00:02:40.490> millimeters

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
approximately two and a half millimeters

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.940 
approximately two and a half millimeters
narrower<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.440> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:42.860> is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
narrower and what that's going to do is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.230 
narrower and what that's going to do is
for<00:02:43.100> those<00:02:43.190> people<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.670> narrower<00:02:43.940> he'll

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
for those people with a narrower he'll

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.120 
for those people with a narrower he'll
really<00:02:44.780> help<00:02:45.020> lock<00:02:45.260> them<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.560> better<00:02:45.770> inside

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
really help lock them in better inside

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.160 
really help lock them in better inside
to<00:02:46.280> skate<00:02:46.520> yeah<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.090> think<00:02:47.420> umm<00:02:47.630> yeah<00:02:48.140> I'm

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
to skate yeah I think umm yeah I'm

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.570 
to skate yeah I think umm yeah I'm
excited<00:02:48.320> about<00:02:48.620> trying<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.040> excited<00:02:49.520> a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
excited about trying that excited a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.550 
excited about trying that excited a
little<00:02:49.700> bit<00:02:49.910> narrower<00:02:50.209> myself<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
little bit narrower myself so I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.050 
little bit narrower myself so I
definitely<00:02:51.680> want<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.010> check<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.400> well

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
definitely want to check that out well

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.850 
definitely want to check that out well
things<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.570> for<00:02:53.810> something<00:02:54.050> by<00:02:54.230> I'm<00:02:54.500> once
