00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.740
 in 2013 the bmw r 12 cents rt was 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.580
 still there I was preferred French 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.710
 just in front of the yamaha fjr pressing and 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.050
 bmw was quick to react 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.270
 a year a little bit after the arrival of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.430
 the new era 12 100 gs here is bmw 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.580
 we present here in Corsica the new 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.140
 sweet era in rt this news 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.059
 generation of rt and well we're going to 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.309
 easily recognize if the bike 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.879
 previous had evolved a little bit 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.309
 over the years 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.690
 in recent years is well one 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.640
 it really is a clean slate and we 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.830
 recognize it immediately it's thanks 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.660
 at this brand new front fairing that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.220
 resumes the aesthetics of the case is this 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.659
 sense I was then some will say 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.460
 that the rt loses some identity 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.960
 okay but at least she wins in 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.030
 dynamism this will allow him 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.800
 to welcome a brand new 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.020
 technology in lighting 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.120
 with notably diode daytime running lights 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.220
 we will also note the arrival of a 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.950
 all new bubble and side protection 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.150
 rather make sure one of the points 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.440
 important that characterizes this 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.220
 new generation of rtc of course 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.010
 engine evolution 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.600
 she inherits the engine from the always gs 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.909
 a flat twin of a ten engine 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.409
 boxers cooled by air and by or even 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.329
 if you see small fins and 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.950
 Well, it's normal because the air plays 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.450
 always a role of cooling and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.539
 we find small radiators just 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.880
 behind this imposing fairing he evolves 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.100
 for 2014 he wants to be more powerful 125 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.570
 horses in free version and more than 100 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.390
 newtons-cut meters on the most 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.310
 wide part of the diet range 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.610
 the fresh air in rt adopts two series the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.670
 drop 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.590
 of course but also the traction control and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.329
 that's all this is delivered in series and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.530
 coupled with both modes of driving 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.530
 road and rain 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.739
 after a few tens of kilometers 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.549
 gone on the handlebars of this new rt 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.260
 2014 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.150
 well we have good news which 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.950
 liked the rt 2013 should probably 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.689
 loved this new generation of rt 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.459
 2014 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.170
 first of all comfort it is really 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.790
 very good bmw went down every 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.709
 orders which price and which ones have 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.209
 2 cm is no longer in the bike but 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.010
 she remains very comfortable and very 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.390
 finally adapted to the average size 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.390
 the big jigs them who have 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.560
 maybe people born german folded 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.849
 the arrival of new orders at 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.109
 dashboard that may not be okay 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.769
 please no longer open and it will have to 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.510
 that they get used 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.739
 for example for the handles 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.319
 heating must navigate the menus 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.569
 with the pole is good it's to see if we 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.500
 likes we do not like the same user 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.299
 for the retro ones now they are 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340
 collapsible okay very good to park 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.099
 of alert is better but the surface 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.329
 glazed she seems a little lower you 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.530
 will you confirm it for example in 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.359
 the maxitest 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.549
 for the rest this rt retains a 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.379
 really punchy motor that vibrates - so 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.780
 it's very nice orders 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.519
 flexible adjustable all is very nice 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.680
 also also the selection progresses 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.569
 but there is still to note the arrival 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.669
 of the shifter pro that allows to mount and 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.120
 to go down the gears without touching 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.180
 the clutch 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.409
 so that's a point that we have 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.370
 left a bit puzzled we do not have 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.319
 found a lot of pleasure in 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.280
 the use of this system is necessary 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.019
 to be really high in the towers 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.819
 be really on the right diet the good 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.829
 legacy lego to see the gas tightly closed 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.419
 to get in gear good it was 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.940
 not very convincing to use us 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.030
 will check during a test 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.160
 more complete and she keeps the awesome 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.890
 compromise that she has since 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.110
 several generations between stability 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.700
 high speed heading and agility 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.200
 there on the Corsican roads that 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.790
 tournicotent is a treat is the 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.280
 place as we want and she absorbs 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.780
 all the irregularities thanks to his 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.250
 suspensions that works very very well 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.620
 in depreciation so it's really 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.010
 well comfort passenger pilot that's it 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.630
 the top 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.910
 and that's what really makes the force 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.920
 rt still in 2014 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.180
 Here is the complete test on motorcycle 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.180
 station.com and I'll see you soon
