 Hey guys! So today I'm going to do a tutorial based on the "Scream" mask, so if you do 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.099
 guys like this type of video, if you think this came out pretty cool, i thought 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.939
 I have a good job on this one to be honest, don't forget to give me a thumbs up! 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.980
 So the first thing you want to do is outline where you go for the eye holes and 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.360
 the mouth. I want to start with a white body paint and then if you need to make any changes to you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.299
 can only use to clear makeup. For me, that was the easier way to do this. You can do it with 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:45.309
 Instead of black personal preference - but me, I got a white one. You don't have to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.769
 To use the greatest brush you own use this. It will probably save you a headache. 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.140
 And then when you start painting your face, just make sure the white is as opaque as you 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.729
 can get it. You don't want any irregular spots because I don't think it's very scary ... 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 moody spots on your mask. I don't know, it's just me. Then when you're down, you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.310
 can start working on the black eye holes and then the mouth and nose. I'll use it 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 a smaller brush for this one just so you don't mess up the white you've already done 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.740
 for it will fix the greatest pain in the beef butt. I have to do this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:02:13.920
 before ... not fun. Then, when you paint is your mouth, try really hard not to get it 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.170
 paint in your mouth because it really is not good taste. Also don't forget to do your ears 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.980
 when you do this. It will look rather odd If your whole face and chest are painted and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:53.780
 your ears are just colored people. Then for my favorite part of this video, is 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.530
 the shadow! I don't think it was gramatically correct, anywhoo! For this, I would just look 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.420
 on a photo of a real mask, or if you are one with you- I don't know why you would 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.680
 the paint becomes your face like this if you are one, but whatever. Just choose a team you like 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.349
 go out for the kight and make sure shade very well on the other side 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:24.569
 To give you lots of shade to bring the depth and definition into this look. I'll have to 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.310
 A link to the picture I use in my blog will have a link if you want to watch guys 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.310
 that out. And just for the record, it's about 4 times I've tried to do this voice 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.400
 about, thanks technology issues. So! If you guys like this video, don't forget to give me one 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.430
 thumbs up, write to see what comes out of my channel next! and let me know you 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.019
