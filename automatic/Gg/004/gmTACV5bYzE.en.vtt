00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
have to have a diagnosis and and and so

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.689 
have to have a diagnosis and and and so
they<00:00:25.990> start<00:00:26.829> thinking<00:00:27.039> there's<00:00:27.460> something

wrong with them
and<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:31.119> me<00:00:31.239> that<00:00:31.269> principles<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.290> my<00:00:32.500> saving

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
and for me that principles is my saving

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.370 
and for me that principles is my saving
grace<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.340> their<00:00:33.850> saving<00:00:34.360> grace<00:00:34.570> because<00:00:35.079> I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
grace and their saving grace because I

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.820 
grace and their saving grace because I
know<00:00:35.890> I<00:00:36.730> know<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:38.440> within<00:00:39.400> them<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:41.680> are

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
know I know that within them they are

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.170 
know I know that within them they are
something<00:00:42.130> more<00:00:42.340> than<00:00:44.610> whatever<00:00:45.610> state<00:00:46.060> of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
something more than whatever state of

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.120 
something more than whatever state of
mind<00:00:46.450> they're<00:00:46.900> in<00:00:47.080> that's<00:00:47.290> got<00:00:47.560> them<00:00:47.800> that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
mind they're in that's got them that

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.750 
mind they're in that's got them that
diagnosis<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:49.150> know<00:00:49.510> within<00:00:50.080> them<00:00:50.530> they<00:00:51.340> hold

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
diagnosis I know within them they hold

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.890 
diagnosis I know within them they hold
the<00:00:52.030> knowledge<00:00:52.270> of<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.840> principles<00:00:53.470> they<00:00:54.190> may

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
the knowledge of the principles they may

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.630 
the knowledge of the principles they may
they<00:00:55.900> may<00:00:55.930> at<00:00:56.260> some<00:00:56.290> time<00:00:56.680> in<00:00:56.860> their<00:00:56.980> life<00:00:57.160> see

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
they may at some time in their life see

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.940 
they may at some time in their life see
the<00:00:57.850> principles<00:00:58.330> way<00:00:58.480> beyond<00:00:58.900> me<00:00:59.230> because

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
the principles way beyond me because

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.590 
the principles way beyond me because
they<00:01:00.670> were<00:01:01.600> born<00:01:01.900> with<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.650> same<00:01:03.600> connection

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
they were born with the same connection

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.920 
they were born with the same connection
to<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.110> principles<00:01:05.650> as<00:01:05.799> I<00:01:06.009> was<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.869> were

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
to the principles as I was they were

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.320 
to the principles as I was they were
born<00:01:08.380> in<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.650> same<00:01:08.979> feeling<00:01:09.640> state<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
born in the same feeling state of the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.750 
born in the same feeling state of the
principle<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:10.990> violence<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.890> that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
principle of the violence and that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.840 
principle of the violence and that
doesn't<00:01:13.360> get<00:01:13.540> affected<00:01:13.690> by<00:01:14.670> whatever<00:01:15.670> has

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
doesn't get affected by whatever has

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.580 
doesn't get affected by whatever has
happened<00:01:15.880> in<00:01:16.390> terms<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.690> contaminating

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
happened in terms of contaminating

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.100 
happened in terms of contaminating
people's<00:01:18.010> thinking<00:01:18.280> that's<00:01:19.030> still<00:01:19.420> there<00:01:19.690> so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
people's thinking that's still there so

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.100 
people's thinking that's still there so
for<00:01:20.920> me<00:01:21.100> that's<00:01:21.340> been<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.810> powerful<00:01:22.810> thing<00:01:23.050> to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
for me that's been a powerful thing to

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.740 
for me that's been a powerful thing to
be<00:01:23.560> able<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.950> sit<00:01:24.280> with<00:01:24.490> people<00:01:24.700> no<00:01:25.540> matter

that understanding themselves but people

will<00:02:03.310> resonate<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.600> someone<00:02:05.500> really<00:02:05.979> knowing

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
will resonate to someone really knowing

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
will resonate to someone really knowing
that

they have health within them and that
within<00:02:09.210> them<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.140> knowledge

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
within them they have this knowledge

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.090 
within them they have this knowledge
because<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.360> times<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.500> bet<00:02:13.830> any

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
because there are times in I bet any

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.910 
because there are times in I bet any
relationship<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.880> know<00:02:14.940> they're<00:02:15.210> been<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.540> mind

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
relationship I know they're been in mind

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440 
relationship I know they're been in mind
then<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> got<00:02:17.310> caught<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.880> way<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> thinking

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
then I got caught in a way of thinking

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.150 
then I got caught in a way of thinking
that<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.600> thought<00:02:18.870> my<00:02:19.050> wife<00:02:19.260> was<00:02:19.470> broken<00:02:20.010> you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that I thought my wife was broken you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.950 
that I thought my wife was broken you
know<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.750> light

know or like you know not the light

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.510 
know or like you know not the light
person<00:02:22.320> or<00:02:22.650> there's<00:02:22.860> something<00:02:23.070> wrong<00:02:23.250> with

that they are completely healthy we're

that they are completely healthy we're
at<00:02:55.290> not<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.940> kind<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.420> thinking<00:02:57.780> they<00:02:58.709> get

at not for the kind of thinking they get

at not for the kind of thinking they get
into<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.520> bit<00:02:59.820> early<00:03:00.180> they'd<00:03:00.570> be<00:03:00.630> fine

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
into a bit early they'd be fine

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.220 
into a bit early they'd be fine
it<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.860> truly<00:03:02.400> about<00:03:03.060> having<00:03:04.050> an

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
it is truly about having an

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.090 
it is truly about having an
understanding<00:03:05.030> rather<00:03:06.030> than<00:03:06.840> having<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.530> do

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.979 

because<00:03:11.100> it's<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.780> understanding

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
because it's the understanding

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.060 
because it's the understanding
it's<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.940> click<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.180> people<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.140> AHA<00:03:16.739> in

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
it's that click in people that AHA in

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.930 
it's that click in people that AHA in
people<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.959> realization<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.860> people<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.850> you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
people the realization in people and you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.780 
people the realization in people and you
talk<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.299> them<00:03:21.690> about<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.230> principles<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.640> I

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
talk to them about the principles and I

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.020 
talk to them about the principles and I
don't<00:03:23.850> really<00:03:24.360> know<00:03:24.920> what<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.100> realization

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
don't really know what the realization

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.380 
don't really know what the realization
is<00:03:27.590> I'm<00:03:28.590> talking<00:03:29.280> about<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.790> principles

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
is I'm talking about the principles

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.990 
is I'm talking about the principles
their<00:03:30.989> realization<00:03:31.890> seems<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.549> be<00:03:32.700> something

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
their realization seems to be something

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.630 
their realization seems to be something
about<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.600> principles<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.350> think<00:03:34.769> it's

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
about the principles but I think it's

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.199 
about the principles but I think it's
really<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.390> they<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.930> heard<00:03:37.350> from<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
really that they just heard from a

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.690 
really that they just heard from a
deeper<00:03:39.209> intelligence<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:41.040> lined<00:03:41.430> up

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
deeper intelligence and it it lined up

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.580 
deeper intelligence and it it lined up
their<00:03:41.970> thinking<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.720> they<00:03:42.810> saw<00:03:43.049> something

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
their thinking and they saw something

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.250 
their thinking and they saw something
beyond<00:03:44.040> their<00:03:44.850> usual<00:03:45.120> way<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.630> thinking<00:03:46.170> and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
beyond their usual way of thinking and

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.979 
beyond their usual way of thinking and
then<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.560> forms<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:47.220> forms<00:03:48.209> from<00:03:48.420> thought<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
then it forms it forms from thought the

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.080 
then it forms it forms from thought the
same<00:03:49.260> way<00:03:49.470> as<00:03:49.680> all<00:03:49.920> their<00:03:50.100> other<00:03:50.280> thinking<00:03:50.880> and

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
same way as all their other thinking and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.710 
same way as all their other thinking and
they<00:03:51.720> say<00:03:51.959> oh<00:03:52.140> yeah<00:03:52.590> look<00:03:53.250> at<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.720> when

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
they say oh yeah look at this when

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.699 
they say oh yeah look at this when
people<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.680> understanding<00:03:56.180> that

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
people have that understanding that

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.250 
people have that understanding that
doing<00:03:58.709> follows<00:03:59.420> that's<00:04:00.420> why<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.720> don't<00:04:00.989> have

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
doing follows that's why you don't have

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.490 
doing follows that's why you don't have
to<00:04:01.860> do<00:04:02.100> anything<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.600> minute<00:04:04.049> you

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
to do anything because the minute you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.319 
to do anything because the minute you
have<00:04:04.680> an<00:04:04.890> understanding<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.790> nature<00:04:05.970> of

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
have an understanding the nature of

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.960 
have an understanding the nature of
thought<00:04:07.170> your<00:04:07.739> thought<00:04:08.070> changes<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.880> then

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
thought your thought changes and then

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.670 
thought your thought changes and then
everything<00:04:09.420> else<00:04:09.540> about<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.110> follows

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
everything else about you follows

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.509 
everything else about you follows
now<00:04:13.680> if<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.280> focus<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.360> Dewey<00:04:16.519> you're

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
now if you focus on the Dewey you're

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.140 
now if you focus on the Dewey you're
missing<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.329> whole<00:04:19.070> aspect<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.370> people<00:04:20.790> because

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
missing a whole aspect of people because

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.350 
missing a whole aspect of people because
now<00:04:21.690> you're<00:04:22.049> working<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:23.670> trying<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.210> help

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
now you're working and trying to help

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.150 
now you're working and trying to help
them<00:04:24.540> with<00:04:24.720> what<00:04:25.080> they've<00:04:25.230> already<00:04:25.440> formed

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
them with what they've already formed

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.000 
them with what they've already formed
you<00:04:26.400> see<00:04:26.700> they've<00:04:27.390> already<00:04:27.600> formed<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.500> kind<00:04:28.740> of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
you see they've already formed a kind of

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.030 
you see they've already formed a kind of
thinking<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.580> they're<00:04:29.700> saying<00:04:30.860> teach<00:04:31.860> me

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
thinking and they're saying teach me

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.180 
thinking and they're saying teach me
something<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.580> do<00:04:32.760> about<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.360> thinking<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:33.990> do

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
something to do about this thinking I do

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.520 
something to do about this thinking I do
like<00:04:35.190> how<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.790> stop<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.450> or<00:04:36.990> how<00:04:37.200> can<00:04:37.410> I

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
like how can I stop it or how can I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.580 
like how can I stop it or how can I
change<00:04:37.830> think<00:04:38.280> more<00:04:38.460> positively<00:04:39.150> or<00:04:39.540> how<00:04:40.320> can

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
change think more positively or how can

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
change think more positively or how can
I<00:04:40.710> feel<00:04:41.550> better<00:04:41.880> think<00:04:42.300> better<00:04:42.450> about<00:04:42.630> myself

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
I feel better think better about myself

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.360 
I feel better think better about myself
well<00:04:44.610> one<00:04:44.790> thing<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.440> people<00:04:46.440> already<00:04:46.860> could

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
well one thing that people already could

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.720 
well one thing that people already could
do<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.640> they<00:04:47.820> would<00:04:47.970> do<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:49.400> let<00:04:50.400> me<00:04:50.520> tell

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
do it they would do it and let me tell

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.150 
do it they would do it and let me tell
you<00:04:50.910> every<00:04:51.270> technique<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.990> gave<00:04:52.260> people<00:04:52.530> before

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
you every technique I gave people before

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.920 
you every technique I gave people before
I<00:04:53.190> have<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:53.610> understanding<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.420> principles

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
I have this understanding the principles

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.880 
I have this understanding the principles
worked<00:04:55.770> about<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.370> week<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:57.020> then<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.440> didn't

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
worked about a week and then it didn't

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.050 
worked about a week and then it didn't
work<00:04:58.920> anymore<00:04:59.340> why<00:04:59.850> they<00:05:00.420> did<00:05:00.750> not<00:05:01.050> understand

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
work anymore why they did not understand

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.640 
work anymore why they did not understand
where<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.390> thinking<00:05:03.930> came<00:05:04.200> from<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.620> the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
where the thinking came from in the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.030 
where the thinking came from in the
first<00:05:04.770> place<00:05:05.660> it's<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.870> understanding<00:05:07.260> that

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
first place it's the understanding that

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.880 
first place it's the understanding that
people<00:05:08.280> get<00:05:08.790> their<00:05:09.240> own<00:05:09.450> glimmer<00:05:09.960> as<00:05:10.440> Kathy

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
people get their own glimmer as Kathy

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.740 
people get their own glimmer as Kathy
Casey<00:05:11.130> says<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.520> lot<00:05:11.760> we<00:05:11.880> just<00:05:12.120> get<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> glimmer

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
Casey says a lot we just get a glimmer

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.370 
Casey says a lot we just get a glimmer
of<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:14.220> principles<00:05:14.880> but<00:05:15.419> that's<00:05:15.630> enough<00:05:16.080> for

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
of the principles but that's enough for

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.220 
of the principles but that's enough for
people<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.770> change<00:05:16.980> their<00:05:17.280> whole<00:05:17.400> world

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
people to change their whole world

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.200 
people to change their whole world
it's<00:05:19.230> enough<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:19.590> people<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.190> fall<00:05:20.640> in<00:05:20.970> love

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
it's enough for people to fall in love

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.159 
it's enough for people to fall in love
again<00:05:21.390> with<00:05:21.570> their<00:05:22.050> partner<00:05:23.810> it's<00:05:24.810> it's

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
again with their partner it's it's

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.840 
again with their partner it's it's
enough<00:05:25.560> for<00:05:25.740> people<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.070> no<00:05:26.340> longer<00:05:26.520> be

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
enough for people to no longer be

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.560 
enough for people to no longer be
depressed<00:05:27.330> or<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:28.320> know<00:05:28.470> how<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.850> handle<00:05:29.850> low

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
depressed or to know how to handle low

depressed or to know how to handle low
moods<00:05:30.930> or<00:05:31.320> their<00:05:31.740> difficulties<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:32.850> just

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
moods or their difficulties it's just

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.860 
moods or their difficulties it's just
enough<00:05:33.479> without<00:05:34.410> that<00:05:34.970> people<00:05:35.970> need<00:05:36.150> more<00:05:36.450> of

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
enough without that people need more of

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.590 
enough without that people need more of
good<00:05:37.260> thoughts<00:05:37.640> don't<00:05:38.640> need<00:05:38.820> more<00:05:39.030> techniques

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
good thoughts don't need more techniques

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.330 
good thoughts don't need more techniques
on<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.140> on<00:05:40.260> on<00:05:40.470> they<00:05:40.650> keep<00:05:40.830> looking<00:05:41.160> for

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
on and on on they keep looking for

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.980 
on and on on they keep looking for
technique<00:05:41.760> keep<00:05:42.060> looking<00:05:42.360> for<00:05:42.540> techniques

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
technique keep looking for techniques

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.810 
technique keep looking for techniques
because<00:05:43.200> they<00:05:43.320> think<00:05:43.380> it's<00:05:44.130> coming<00:05:44.430> from<00:05:44.580> the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
because they think it's coming from the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.360 
because they think it's coming from the
outside<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.570> rather<00:05:46.470> than<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:46.979> they<00:05:47.130> hold

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
outside in rather than that they hold

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.480 
outside in rather than that they hold
within<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.270> answer<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:48.930> all<00:05:48.960> their

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
within and the answer to all their

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.990 
within and the answer to all their
troubled<00:05:50.490> questions<00:05:51.410> so<00:05:52.410> so<00:05:53.040> it<00:05:53.220> is<00:05:53.250> it's<00:05:53.669> just

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
troubled questions so so it is it's just

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.950 
troubled questions so so it is it's just
with<00:05:54.630> your<00:05:54.810> own<00:05:54.990> certainty<00:05:55.860> that

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
with your own certainty that

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.750 
with your own certainty that
understanding<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:58.140> what<00:05:58.500> what<00:05:59.160> changes

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
understanding is what what changes

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.409 
understanding is what what changes
people<00:06:00.440> if<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.770> know<00:06:02.010> that<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.790> just<00:06:02.820> keep<00:06:03.210> at

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
people if you know that you just keep at

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.360 
people if you know that you just keep at
it<00:06:03.450> with<00:06:03.750> people<00:06:04.050> of<00:06:04.140> course<00:06:04.440> you<00:06:04.979> do<00:06:05.190> it

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
it with people of course you do it

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.990 
it with people of course you do it
kindly<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.210> with<00:06:06.270> caring<00:06:06.960> and<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:08.340> so<00:06:08.640> forth

but you're always you're always about to

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.980 
but you're always you're always about to
wrapping<00:06:11.700> them<00:06:11.850> to<00:06:12.150> get<00:06:12.570> their<00:06:12.840> own

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
wrapping them to get their own

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.590 
wrapping them to get their own
understanding<00:06:13.710> from<00:06:14.640> within<00:06:14.940> they're<00:06:15.450> off

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
understanding from within they're off

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.950 
understanding from within they're off
within<00:06:16.310> themselves

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
within themselves

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.340 
within themselves
that's<00:06:18.410> where<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.100> power<00:06:19.340> lies<00:06:20.199> to<00:06:21.199> do

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
that's where the power lies to do

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.210 
that's where the power lies to do
anything<00:06:21.710> else

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
anything else

don't<00:06:22.820> you<00:06:22.910> see<00:06:23.120> let's<00:06:23.539> sell<00:06:23.810> them<00:06:24.050> short<00:06:24.190> you

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
don't you see let's sell them short you

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.800 
don't you see let's sell them short you
would<00:06:25.370> say<00:06:25.550> you<00:06:25.610> don't<00:06:25.820> have<00:06:26.090> it<00:06:26.240> so<00:06:26.389> let<00:06:26.750> me

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
would say you don't have it so let me

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.450 
would say you don't have it so let me
give<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.110> a<00:06:27.199> technique<00:06:27.770> I've<00:06:28.009> got<00:06:28.310> the

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
give you a technique I've got the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.490 
give you a technique I've got the
technique<00:06:28.910> for<00:06:29.210> you<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.990> see

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
technique for you you see

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.670 
technique for you you see
well<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:32.360> anytime<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.229> come<00:06:33.410> up<00:06:33.530> with<00:06:33.650> a

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
well the anytime you come up with a

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.830 
well the anytime you come up with a
technique<00:06:34.190> for<00:06:34.430> somebody<00:06:34.789> they're<00:06:35.389> getting<00:06:35.750> a

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
technique for somebody they're getting a

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.879 
technique for somebody they're getting a
sense<00:06:36.320> of<00:06:36.500> oh<00:06:36.590> I<00:06:36.650> don't<00:06:36.740> have<00:06:36.949> it<00:06:37.009> in<00:06:37.250> me<00:06:37.660> got<00:06:38.660> it

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
sense of oh I don't have it in me got it

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.409 
sense of oh I don't have it in me got it
well<00:06:39.889> what<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.550> people<00:06:41.000> who<00:06:41.090> teach<00:06:41.300> the

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
well what the people who teach the

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.390 
well what the people who teach the
principles<00:06:41.810> are<00:06:41.900> saying<00:06:42.110> no<00:06:42.259> no<00:06:42.440> no<00:06:42.590> you<00:06:43.280> don't

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
principles are saying no no no you don't

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.490 
principles are saying no no no you don't
want<00:06:43.610> to<00:06:43.639> settle<00:06:43.910> for<00:06:44.030> a<00:06:44.240> technique<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:45.259> want

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
want to settle for a technique you want

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.640 
want to settle for a technique you want
to<00:06:45.620> get<00:06:45.889> what<00:06:46.220> you<00:06:46.400> have<00:06:46.430> in<00:06:46.940> you<00:06:47.330> you<00:06:48.289> want<00:06:48.530> to

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
to get what you have in you you want to

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.120 
to get what you have in you you want to
hear<00:06:48.949> from<00:06:49.340> that<00:06:49.850> so<00:06:50.840> I'm<00:06:51.139> always<00:06:51.349> going<00:06:51.770> for

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
go going to help them gain and

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.860 
go going to help them gain and
understanding<00:06:56.330> bringing<00:06:57.020> it<00:06:57.169> out<00:06:57.320> of<00:06:57.620> them
