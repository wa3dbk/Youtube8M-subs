00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
that it moves all the way into the homes

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
that it moves all the way into the homes
position<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.590> you'll<00:01:57.800> know<00:01:58.010> that<00:01:58.360> it's<00:01:59.360> all

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
position and you'll know that it's all

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.230 
position and you'll know that it's all
the<00:01:59.750> way<00:01:59.870> forward<00:02:00.220> if<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.550> can<00:02:01.730> turn<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
the way forward if you can turn the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.840 
the way forward if you can turn the
slotted<00:02:02.690> screw<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.200> back<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.550> locked

slotted screw in the back to the locked

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.050 
slotted screw in the back to the locked
position<00:02:05.800> if<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:07.040> can't<00:02:07.310> turn<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:07.910> means

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
position if you can't turn it it means

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.520 
position if you can't turn it it means
that<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.450> binding<00:02:08.810> needs<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.170> go<00:02:09.290> farther

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
that the binding needs to go farther

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.480 
that the binding needs to go farther
forward<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.380> last<00:02:12.590> step<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.160> adjust

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
forward and the last step is to adjust

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.630 
forward and the last step is to adjust
the<00:02:13.880> heel<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:14.990> case<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.470> put<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:15.800> toe<00:02:16.490> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the heel in this case we put this toe of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.910 
the heel in this case we put this toe of
the<00:02:16.670> binding<00:02:17.150> toe<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.050> boot<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.710> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the binding toe of the boot in the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.370 
the binding toe of the boot in the
binding<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:21.140> test<00:02:21.470> fit<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:24.260> it

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
binding and we test fit it and if it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.830 
binding and we test fit it and if it
needs<00:02:24.590> adjustment<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.160> use<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.840> screw

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
needs adjustment then we use this screw

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.050 
needs adjustment then we use this screw
right<00:02:30.050> here<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:31.310> bring<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.700> binding

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
right here to bring the binding

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.640 
right here to bring the binding
backwards<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:33.680> forward<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.830> that's<00:02:37.430> it
