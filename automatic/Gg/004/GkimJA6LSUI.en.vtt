00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
down a size what matters most is the fit

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
down a size what matters most is the fit
and<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.030> fill<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> garment<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and the fill of the garment and how I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.999 
and the fill of the garment and how I
fill<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> garments<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.590> number<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
fill in the garments so the number on

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.179 
fill in the garments so the number on
the<00:01:47.159> tag<00:01:47.399> doesn't<00:01:48.030> mean<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.540> thing<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the tag doesn't mean a thing and it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
the tag doesn't mean a thing and it
shouldn't<00:01:50.460> mean<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
shouldn't mean a thing because it's just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.080 
shouldn't mean a thing because it's just
a<00:01:52.290> number<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> number<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.000> the
