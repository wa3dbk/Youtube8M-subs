 illy d'alloro expresses the execution of curves conducted with motor actions 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.519
 states that they exploit the characteristics of the 3 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.630
 make the change of the corners in translation and extension eng modular 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.660
 ligament angle until the earth closes 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 to achieve this technical goal the student must develop the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.110
 first the screw execute courbet sequences maintaining the centrality 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.579
 the result of all the forces acting on the ricadi trail vv 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 inside the foot support base 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.640
 start the curve with addressing 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 continue conducting by modulating angle folding 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.430
 the bust collaborates in maintaining balance by confessing towards 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 the outside 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.409
 perform sequences of curves conducted with different stick positions 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 adapt a sequence of curves conducted by particular situations of slopes 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.920
 run sequences of curves improving coordination he won 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.410
 safe support sequences conducted 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.950
 sequences with double internal support. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 choreographic sequences 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.680
 sequences with internal upper arm in external hand on the experienced knee 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.759
 improving the adaptive life different bridge equity changes me 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.839
 perform sequences of hazzard conducted curves compressed on average slope 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.569
 perform sequences of curves conducted on an ancient arch on a medium-rich slope 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:11.069
 perform sequences of curves conducted on a medium liquid slope on a medium arc 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.369
 perform sequences of curves conducted on a very rigid slope
