00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.130
 Hi, I'm Mariana and this time 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.860
 I'm going to show the books that I bought in 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.640
 the month of July the first book I asked 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.700
 It was one that I was not very excited about 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.279
 that they brought him to Mexico because 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.740
 I had seen on youtube channels you're 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.509
 from the USA and it was like I need it 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.019
 then and I was also very excited 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.779
 that they left the original cover has a 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.019
 slight change but it's still the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.949
 original and it is prohibitive lloyd of a 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.519
 skin of them who has only read one 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.920
 book I think it's ignore the truth by 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.929
 please is this and the truth is that I 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 I really liked it, I highly recommend it 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.780
 persons aged 13 to 17 years they will 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.039
 love if I'm not wrong I think the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.320
 book is no longer with this 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.480
 cover has another one here I'm going to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.789
 leave to be seen and well 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.019
 I continue realistically and I'm hardly 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.969
 reading and the truth is that it is 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.269
 liking a lot is about a guy who 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.519
 When I was little, he was in a reality show 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.780
 then the truth did things 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.030
 many people obviously saw and like that the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.490
 consoled conflict now that she is a 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.159
 young adult 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.200
 and well, this one I do not tell you anymore 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.960
 because I do not know much about the book either 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.710
 because I have only about 60 pages but 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.920
 the truth is that I'm liking 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.979
 quite and without a doubt the super 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.259
 I recommend the following book is threat 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.619
 from michelle camp nou of the editorial 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.189
 destination but this is the second part the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.110
 first part is an alliance that has not yet 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.360
 I read but the truth is that seeing that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.060
 I had in my hands the second said I have 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.439
 to read first then I like it a lot 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.210
 because he talks about a girl who is 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.790
 hacker if I'm not wrong 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 says says the back cover that is a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.140
 lonely effector a conspiracy the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 threatens an alliance that supports the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.710
 truth is that it sounds super interesting what 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.060
 he started reading and he caught me but 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.890
 unfortunately he can not continue because 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.830
 I had other books pending but 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.909
 I hope to finish these two in August on 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.770
 next balance that came to me 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.420
 He also made me a lot but a lot 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.459
 illusion that in fact I already finished 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 read but he talks to them in more detail in 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.720
 another video and it is and if we are like 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.310
 friends of elizabeth to see see the only 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.380
 book that this author's idea is the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.700
 club of lonely hearts and 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.830
 many of you already know that I 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.470
 love that book then when you 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.710
 It's in my hands I said I'll love it 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.650
 but but I do not doubt the discount that I 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.310
 it seemed for the time being this is already 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.810
 I have and if you liked the blog of the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.550
 lonely courses I'm sure of 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.510
 that you are going to like this book finally 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.580
 I finally have dreams of gods and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.110
 monsters of the elite gold is the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.820
 third book and check nothing else this 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.750
 huge I do not know what I'm going to do with it 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.450
 the first one is the daughter of very bone 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.540
 preciousness that I read it I think that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.410
 two years ago I do not know if I read it two years ago 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.140
 years 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.800
 last year two years and the truth is 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.800
 I liked it a lot 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.060
 and last year I bought days of blood 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.040
 and glow that is the second part of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.910
 but I have not read it 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.980
 because I do not know I felt like I needed 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.750
 the first one again to have fresh all 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.760
 the events 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.710
 but later I found out that I was going to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.380
 get the third one then I said better me 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.790
 I wait and I launch with all the technology 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.420
 so what I plan to do now that 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.420
 I have 3 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.510
 and they look beautiful they look beautiful is the 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.900
 true 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.239
 I am very promoted and I do not know about you 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.640
 already read I made a very thick and also 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.099
 I asked for the doors of the perception of 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.099
 aldous huxley jon klein 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:00.680
 also help something like this this 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.650
 author wrote a happy world book that 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.980
 I still do not read but I'm dying to read and I already 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.520
 I have and the whole thing but well I do not know in 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.630
 Where am I do not know where I'm finally am 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.040
 the truth is that it seemed very 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.870
 interesting that the doors of the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.310
 perception so I asked and waited for 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.040
 read it soon because you really are 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.980
 super delgadito gÃ¡lvez relevant to a 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.990
 happy world the next or maicon me 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.020
 I say the mark of having that is the third 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.020
 in 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.900
 which is the third that the first is the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.460
 lost hero and the second is the son of 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.069
 Neptune 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.740
 and the truth is that I do not read everything 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.710
 because I have to read the saga first 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.470
 percy jackson and I go in the fourth book 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.190
 so I need to finish them and then 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.060
 I read this second room super interesting 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.990
 the truth is that it is delicious is more 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.990
 good that percy jackson 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.430
 They say that I will not regret reading 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.440
 this and these books so I hope 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.419
 I hope to see you soon my plan is also 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.460
 end percy jackson in august to 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.460
 can read these also in August 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.310
 I sincerely believe that I need to anoint 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.310
 weather 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.060
 and finally I got hell of 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.000
 francisco con kim with this editorial 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.730
 montena and honestly I do not know what 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.860
 try this book I do not know you see 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.750
 interesting because it says songs of the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.480
 divided lands I imagine it is a 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.060
 saga 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.430
 says an overwhelming love story a 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.009
 wild world and an impossible struggle like that 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.900
 what 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.729
 It sounds very interesting and I hope to read it in 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.349
 August and good super all the books 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.699

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.169
 I would like very much that they put me in 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.349
 the comments that books bought 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.539

 then in another video there is this one 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.849

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.090
