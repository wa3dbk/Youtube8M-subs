around<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.969> body<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.930> move<00:00:43.200> from<00:00:43.379> elbow

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
around your body as we move from elbow

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
around your body as we move from elbow
to<00:00:43.950> elbow<00:00:44.210> anchor<00:00:45.210> positioning<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.840> also

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to elbow anchor positioning is also

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.869 
to elbow anchor positioning is also
going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> important<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> setup<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
going to be important in the setup this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
going to be important in the setup this
drill<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.750> need<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> stretch<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.500> anchor

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
drill we need to stretch out the anchor

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.439 
drill we need to stretch out the anchor
and<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.489> safety<00:00:51.120> harness

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and really use that safety harness

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
and really use that safety harness
around<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:51.899> wrist<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.680> sure<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> we

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
around our wrist to be sure that we

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
around our wrist to be sure that we
never<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> chance<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.390> let<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
never have that chance to let go of the

rag stretch for now as the athletes are

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.389 
rag stretch for now as the athletes are
ready<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> move<00:00:58.590> anchors<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.190> go

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ready to move anchors we're gonna go

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.160 
ready to move anchors we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.609> pull<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.149> making<00:01:00.660> sure<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
