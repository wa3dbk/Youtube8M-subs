my<00:00:02.280> stupid<00:00:02.580> annoying<00:00:03.000> sometimes<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:03.990> there

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
my stupid annoying sometimes but there

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.110 
my stupid annoying sometimes but there
are<00:00:04.589> something<00:00:04.920> interesting<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:05.940> can

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
are something interesting that we can

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:19.550 
are something interesting that we can
learn<00:00:06.270> from<00:00:06.480> them<00:00:06.720> as<00:00:06.930> well<00:00:18.439> there<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
learn from them as well there is a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.380 
learn from them as well there is a
common<00:00:19.890> misconception<00:00:19.920> about<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.060> way

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
common misconception about the way

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.420 
common misconception about the way
people<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> fly<00:00:22.710> sees<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> world

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
people think that the fly sees the world

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.089 
people think that the fly sees the world
many<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.410> image<00:00:25.590> looks

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
many think that the image looks

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.910 
many think that the image looks
something<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.910> when<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.960> fact<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
something like this when in fact the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.640 
something like this when in fact the
image<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.369> much<00:00:29.789> more<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:31.470> is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
image is much more like this which is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
image is much more like this which is
basically<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.399> single<00:00:32.940> image<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> has<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
basically a single image that it has a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.580 
basically a single image that it has a
quite<00:00:34.770> low<00:00:35.190> resolution<00:00:36.410> obviously<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
quite low resolution obviously the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.190 
quite low resolution obviously the
question<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> how<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.930> image

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
question then is how is this image

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.510 
question then is how is this image
formed<00:00:41.390> well<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.290> would<00:00:43.410> zoom<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
formed well if we would zoom in and in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
formed well if we would zoom in and in
into<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> eye<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> fly<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:46.739> notice

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
into the eye of the fly we would notice

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.209 
into the eye of the fly we would notice
that<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.430> made<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.059> many<00:00:48.420> small<00:00:48.809> faces<00:00:49.219> each

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that it is made of many small faces each

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
that it is made of many small faces each
face<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.090> fact<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> part<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
face it in fact is a part of a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.270 
face it in fact is a part of a
rod-shaped<00:00:52.949> structure<00:00:53.820> called<00:00:54.239> ommatidia

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
rod-shaped structure called ommatidia

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
rod-shaped structure called ommatidia
each<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.550> material<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.210> made<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.960> two<00:00:58.199> parts

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
each a material is made of two parts

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.490 
each a material is made of two parts
one<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.640> captures<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> light<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
one that captures the light and one that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
one that captures the light and one that
absorbs<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> light<00:01:02.390> when<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> light<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
absorbs the light when the light is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.469 
absorbs the light when the light is
reflected<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.799> object<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.400> enters<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
reflected from an object it enters the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
reflected from an object it enters the
light<00:01:06.659> capturing<00:01:07.320> part<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.640> part

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
light capturing part and in that part

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990 
light capturing part and in that part
there<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.540> lens<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.979> lens<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.430> focuses

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
there is lens and the lens then focuses

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
there is lens and the lens then focuses
the<00:01:12.180> light<00:01:12.360> onto<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> photoreceptor<00:01:13.350> cells

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the light onto the photoreceptor cells

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.999 
the light onto the photoreceptor cells
in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.970> light<00:01:15.290> absorbing<00:01:16.290> part<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
in the light absorbing part of the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
in the light absorbing part of the
ommatidia<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.600> photoreceptor<00:01:19.530> cells

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
ommatidia in these photoreceptor cells

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
ommatidia in these photoreceptor cells
there<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.520> many<00:01:20.850> different<00:01:21.330> pigments<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
there are many different pigments that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
there are many different pigments that
can<00:01:22.409> absorb<00:01:22.590> light<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.280> different<00:01:23.640> wavelength

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
can absorb light of different wavelength

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
can absorb light of different wavelength
when<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> pigment<00:01:25.770> absorbs<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> light<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
when the pigment absorbs the light a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.850 
when the pigment absorbs the light a
signal<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.509> sent<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> brains<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> fly

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
signal is sent to the brains of the fly

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.069 
signal is sent to the brains of the fly
which<00:01:29.520> processes<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> image<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> basically

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
which processes the image and basically

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.679 
which processes the image and basically
tell<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> fly<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> sees<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.820> thing<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
tell the fly what it sees a thing to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
tell the fly what it sees a thing to
note<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> image<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.250> formed

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
note about the way the image is formed

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.179 
note about the way the image is formed
is<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.479> each<00:01:36.689> omote<00:01:37.079> idiom<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> eye<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
is that each omote idiom in the eye of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
is that each omote idiom in the eye of
the<00:01:38.340> fly<00:01:38.460> acts<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.360> an<00:01:39.509> isolated<00:01:40.259> structure

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the fly acts as an isolated structure

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.960 
the fly acts as an isolated structure
that<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> each<00:01:42.420> material<00:01:43.759> gives<00:01:44.759> information

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that is each material gives information

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
that is each material gives information
about<00:01:45.899> only<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.619> certain<00:01:47.340> piece<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.600> whole

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
about only a certain piece of the whole

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.219 
about only a certain piece of the whole
image<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
image you can think of it

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.330 
image you can think of it
you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.439> think<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> puzzle

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
you can think about it as as a puzzle

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
you can think about it as as a puzzle
each<00:01:56.340> piece<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.479> puzzle<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.680> as

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
each piece of the puzzle is the same as

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.030 
each piece of the puzzle is the same as
each<00:01:59.310> material<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> only<00:02:01.259> when<00:02:01.469> all<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
each material and only when all of the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.350 
each material and only when all of the
pieces<00:02:02.280> come<00:02:02.700> together

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
pieces come together

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
pieces come together
the<00:02:03.659> full<00:02:03.869> image<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.469> formed<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.850> fly<00:02:06.030> would

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the full image is formed if a fly would

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.749 
the full image is formed if a fly would
lack<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.899> few<00:02:07.350> pieces<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> puzzle<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.459> is

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
lack a few pieces of the puzzle that is

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.710 
lack a few pieces of the puzzle that is
it<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.179> lack<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> few<00:02:09.720> ommatidia<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
it would lack a few ommatidia then the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.080 
it would lack a few ommatidia then the
you<00:02:11.870> would<00:02:11.960> not<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.350> full<00:02:12.700> another<00:02:13.700> thing<00:02:13.940> to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
you would not be full another thing to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.250 
you would not be full another thing to
note<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:15.320> number<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.890> materia<00:02:16.700> per<00:02:16.970> I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
note is that the number of materia per I

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
yourself that is it is quite hard to

yourself that is it is quite hard to
catch<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.970> fly<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.980> usually<00:03:00.980> flies<00:03:01.220> away<00:03:01.550> faster

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
catch a fly it usually flies away faster

can<00:03:05.000> detect<00:03:05.330> movements<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:05.990> well<00:03:06.230> because

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
can detect movements so well because

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.820 
can detect movements so well because
they<00:03:07.190> act<00:03:07.580> at<00:03:07.970> higher<00:03:08.630> frames<00:03:09.140> per<00:03:09.410> second

and that's all good for human eye to
fuse<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.830> form<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:19.519> single<00:03:19.880> moving<00:03:20.060> image<00:03:20.600> but

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
fuse and form a single moving image but

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.820 
fuse and form a single moving image but
for<00:03:21.680> fly<00:03:21.950> movies<00:03:22.850> should<00:03:23.060> be<00:03:23.209> made<00:03:23.390> at<00:03:23.600> least

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
for fly movies should be made at least

for fly movies should be made at least
300<00:03:24.830> frames<00:03:25.040> per<00:03:25.310> second<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.180> achieve<00:03:26.450> the

300 frames per second to achieve the

same thing the 24 frames per second

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.500 
same thing the 24 frames per second
movie<00:03:30.230> would<00:03:30.830> look<00:03:31.430> for<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.730> fly<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.330> as<00:03:32.480> a

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
movie would look for a fly just as a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.320 
movie would look for a fly just as a
single<00:03:32.900> frame<00:03:33.650> splashing<00:03:34.400> by<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:34.790> by<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
single frame splashing by and by and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.080 
single frame splashing by and by and
that's<00:03:36.260> basically<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.010> way<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.580> eyes<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
that's basically the way the eyes of the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.120 
that's basically the way the eyes of the
fly<00:03:38.269> work<00:03:38.570> I<00:03:38.840> hope<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.380> enjoyed<00:03:39.709> this<00:03:39.830> video
