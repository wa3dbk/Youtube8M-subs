00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
come out intermittent fasting that's

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.220 
come out intermittent fasting that's
basically<00:03:20.609> eating<00:03:20.879> two<00:03:21.120> meals<00:03:21.329> in<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.810> 24-hour

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
basically eating two meals in a 24-hour

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.900 
basically eating two meals in a 24-hour
period<00:03:22.290> some<00:03:23.010> people<00:03:23.220> switch<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.579> some<00:03:23.790> do

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
period some people switch it up some do

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.099 
period some people switch it up some do
like<00:03:23.940> two<00:03:24.180> mules<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> nine<00:03:24.690> hour<00:03:24.810> period

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
like two mules and a nine hour period

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.720 
like two mules and a nine hour period
some<00:03:25.260> people<00:03:25.590> go<00:03:25.680> like<00:03:25.829> crazy<00:03:26.129> amount<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.579> time

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
some people go like crazy amount of time

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.580 
some people go like crazy amount of time
but<00:03:27.209> whatever<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.629> point<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.019> it's<00:03:28.349> almost

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
but whatever the point is it's almost

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.960 
but whatever the point is it's almost
like<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.799> version<00:03:29.129> of<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> Warriors<00:03:29.699> diet

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
