00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.610
 I have not downloaded it yet but I 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 I played a little bit I played one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.070
 bit it's like this is you take one 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.229
 gun and you have to kill zombie it's over but 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.409
 enter that is useful is the last the Swiss team 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 in principle it is named after the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:51.930
 own code even maps us 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:53.790
 with a weapon that is this is this is not 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.049
 more just that you do not have money 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.090
 You need money, you have to kill the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.200
 monster and will give a little fear 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.490
 A few hours listening to the noise 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 if you are seeing up there 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.659
 Gang a zombie craft he'll have the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.800
 I lower it to show when I hear that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.310
 you are 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.160
 To the wave that you are is how much the furniture 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.580
 while the monsters will turn good the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.380
 points is how many points the west sup 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.880
 zombie kill is as you already killed 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.160
 science is a small minor 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.860
 look there this property is leaving 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.780
 decision for those who want to download it is 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.130
 very easy to salon but if you have any 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 You're just talking to me between the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.330
 teaching 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.840
 there our graphic very beautiful is not acting 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.320
 old is not very useful, it's cool, it 's very 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.350
 Good old man. It 's so much fun. 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.060
 I think it ended in the first round 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.810
 It turned out he was in the area and not yet 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.810
 And you saw that it kills but my god that the law 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.010
 It's a little scary because it's kind of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.990
 boss do not do not come blue I never passed 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.610
 the third network because type begins to 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.220
 appear out of nowhere and gives a little fear 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.270
 There you get a new one we already had. 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.130
 a rifle is nra old and orkut to 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.780
 fucking old I found that graphic type 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.350
 It's cute until the sub became more 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.350
 cute little 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.200
 look here cat 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.140
 My God, my God, in the woods, do you kill woods? 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.920
 our old time that the zombie blood 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.920
 his is green, right? 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:41.140
 Robson 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:44.290
 there the dollar in the galley was worth the boot 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.350
 So, she's the one 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.480
 this mold does not require much given alone 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.640
 your computer because it is very 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.680
 easy to download it is very 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.930
 his file is very small so one 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.239
 face even gives you the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.300
 When the end is on, it turns 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.230
 still very soft 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.050
 It's pretty cool right now and multiplayer should be 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.700
 much cooler, right? 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.260
 I think it gives multiplayer this 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.430
 here guy I do not know the type size of 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.100
