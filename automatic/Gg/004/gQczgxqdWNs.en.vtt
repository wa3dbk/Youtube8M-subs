got to be careful glue no on how you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.750 
got to be careful glue no on how you

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
define it right here and then I usually

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.340 
define it right here and then I usually
do<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.030> layer<00:02:02.300> around<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.250> bars<00:02:05.350> this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
do a layer around it to on the bars this

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.780 
do a layer around it to on the bars this
won't<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:06.800> matter<00:02:07.010> at<00:02:07.310> all<00:02:07.400> because<00:02:07.550> you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
won't really matter at all because you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.219 
won't really matter at all because you
can<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.030> scrape<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.420> away<00:02:08.600> if<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.930> really

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
can just scrape it away if you really

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.460 
can just scrape it away if you really

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
it so now we move to this one over here

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.629
