00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.380
 that goes all because we are here 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.330
 a new destination video 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.450
 Today I will be showing you a new guide 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.670
 this guide is about how to get money 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.900
 fast the fastest way that has been 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.660
 discovered so far from getting 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 money first of all I must tell you that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.090
 for this way you need to be level 12 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.470
 at least level 12 I would recommend them 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 that are a little above the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.960
 level 12 I tell you from experience I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.300
 I'm level 16 for level 16 it's pretty 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.789
 easy 9 but good if you're still not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.980
 level 12 below in the description I'm going 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.379
 to leave the link of a video that we upload 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.449
 We did about two months ago how 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 get money fast being a level 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.699
 5 or level 4 is pretty easy is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.060
 pretty father so well good without 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.250
 more let's start 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.350
 and good this new way to win 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.300
 money is on the moon there 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.220
 we are seeing is exactly where 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.160
 flame fire of phoenix and you have in 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.630
 english here the only little detail is that what 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 you have to change to the difficulty what 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.590
 you have to put in difficulty level 12 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.440
 you can put it higher up but 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.390
 basically it does not make sense since the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.760
 they are the same monsters so you will be 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.140
 easier if they are level 12 so good 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.090
 all you have to do is follow 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.310
 in the mission until you get to this 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.950
 part of the tunnels is like a minute 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.229
 after you start the part of the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.660
 darkness so the only thing you have 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.400
 what to do is divert the equipment you removed 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.229
 just if you did not pay attention to what 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.060
 parties simply returns a little bit the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.240
 video and what we are going to be doing is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.910
 kill these 8 or 9 there are no monsters that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.790
 they have as we say that the yellow life 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.430
 it means they are like voices and they go 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.440
 to give gamer for each one that you kill like that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.330
 which is a pretty easy way to 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.240
 get money we are seeing how much 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.490
 gamers I'm getting and still 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 there is a way to still get 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 more money just with this in ones 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.680
 I'll be with you right now 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.259
 but first of all I want to tell you that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.540
 this is also a pretty good place 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.489
 but pretty good to raise level there 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.890
 in the bar below you can see how much 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.319
 how much experience do they give me for each 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.780
 one that killed and is pretty fast 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.569
 very fast less than one minute per lap 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.489
 so it's a super but super way 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.440
 quickly and just right now in the 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.100
 screen we are watching the black watch 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.920
 idol this is is the other way that they 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.140
 was counting a way to duplicate 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.420
 the profits the only thing that you have to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.069
 to do is to get those that in fact you 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 they will throw it often with these 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.500
 here I got 11 in 15 minutes like this 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 that you practically earn one per lap 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.970
 you could say and the only thing you have 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.130
 what to do is go to the menu to the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.319
 inventory and consumables and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.750
 active is what is going to do this and is 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.319
 that is going to give you an extra gamer bonus 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
 for each hype that you kill hype are the 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.180
 races that we are attacking in 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.310
 these moments 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.689
 right now I do not have it activated so 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.140
 what are you seeing from helimer I'm 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:15.920
 winning is without the black wax idol and there 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.439
 we could see as the the silken codex that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.329
 I just got these much eye with 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.250
 this at the end of the video I'm going to 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.379
 show how to redeem the and where 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.989
 exchange the each one that you earn what 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.239
 you can redeem for 200 the glimmers is 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.450
 a super but super good way to 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.010
 make money simply activate it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.099
 leaving the square pressed as well as 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.220
 are watching me active in this 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.599
 part I did not realize I was not active 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.970
 but good the only thing they have to do 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.819
 that's going to last you 10 minutes so 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.549
 you practically need two or three to 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.069
 get 20,000 coins that is a 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.389
 huge amount good I say coins 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.760
 because I'm used to games 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.579
 but really good fencing but it 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.139
 It does not understand and well, these 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.719
 monsters are also going to be pulling 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.189
 ammunition of all kinds so also if 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.790
 you have a certain huevón I you 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.170
 I would recommend that the heavy weapon I 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.480
 I would recommend 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.280
 He changed it to one more chingón or one 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.770
 machine gun there we see that also 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.079
 rise the level goes up to level 17 as 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.150
 I was telling you is a very 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.520
 but very good to level up too 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.320
 so it's not only getting first 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.710
 get money or get coins 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.260
 but it is even training and even 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.950
 a lot of experience there we saw that also 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.470
 got an improvement or a serious one so 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.360
 let's say it 's a very orthodox way 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.800
 to do everything you want is a 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.500
 train very orthodox 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.229
 while you win helimer while the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.510
 coins to get weapons even 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.120
 you will also find many drops or 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.010
 they are going to throw you many very good things 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.169
 the monsters so you just have 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.370
 that go collecting them to me they threw me 3 or 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.270
 4 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.770
 green encrypted things so to the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.850
 end of the video I'm going to show you everything 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.560
 this and well then now let's go to the 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.270
 tower was what I was telling you 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.419
 from the beginning of the video I'm going to 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.030
 teach where we exchange all those 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.130
 things that we got I got 10 there 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.350
 let's see how to exchange them or just 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.410
 we go to the tower and we go to the 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.060
 right with the person that we 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.400
 decrypts weapons and armor 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.350
 there we are going to see I am decrypted 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.110
 the ones that I got, they also give me 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.350
 gamers that's why it's really a way 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.940
 amazing to get everything you 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.949
 want to get if you want to get 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.139
 experience does this way if you want 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.419
 get money olive trees in this way 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.300
 if you want to do challenges that is just 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.220
 to the part that we're going to go in some 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.190
 I will teach you a way 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.020
 of getting twice as much experience 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.050
 to which you get is simply 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.240
 we have to go with the bondi master or with 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.340
 the person who gives us this kind of 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.110
 challenges that surely these will already know 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.070
 challenges that are multiplayer or are not 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.960
 multiplayer 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.300
 let's choose those that are like more 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.980
 gray or blue that are the ones that are not 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.410
 for multiplayer and we're going to look 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.440
 some like this that asks us to kill 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.210
 hype or kill greater height or whatever 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.850
 which are the monsters that 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.620
 we were killing in all the video and 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.060
 Well then this is the way 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.060
 get money and get 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.680
 fastest experience that has been 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.540
 found so far at destination as well 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.820
 Well then, if you liked it please 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.320
 subscribe let's go uploading content 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.720
 of destination and as this one we go up 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.820
 glitches and we went up guides and it's my 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.250
 monster this kind of thing so so 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.080
 good if you liked the video dale I like 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.160

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.160
 next bye
