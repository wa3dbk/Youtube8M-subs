need<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:40.209> sacrifice<00:02:40.510> more<00:02:41.140> highlights

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
need to sacrifice more highlights

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.820 
need to sacrifice more highlights
therefore<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.150> love<00:02:43.660> being<00:02:44.019> able<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.379> recover

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
therefore I love being able to recover

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.400 
therefore I love being able to recover
some<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.489> them<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.750> give<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.080> demonstration

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
some of them to give you a demonstration

some of them to give you a demonstration
you<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.580> here<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:48.879> I<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.209> exposed

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
you can see here that I have exposed

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.290 
you can see here that I have exposed
four<00:02:50.170> gunpowder's<00:02:50.860> face<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.760> there<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.090> some

tsipras on her white patch on the
stomach<00:02:55.050> normally<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.080> wouldn't<00:02:56.470> care<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:57.160> now

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
stomach normally I wouldn't care but now

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.479 
stomach normally I wouldn't care but now
it's<00:02:57.550> easy<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:58.030> me<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.480> make<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.780> look<00:02:58.959> good

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.069 

of<00:03:04.489> course<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.939> highlight<00:03:05.269> recovery<00:03:05.810> can't

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
of course the highlight recovery can't

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.099 
of course the highlight recovery can't
always<00:03:06.349> save<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.310> better<00:03:08.090> than<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.629> find<00:03:08.840> some

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
always save you better than to find some

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.399 
always save you better than to find some
sort<00:03:09.379> of<00:03:09.409> compromise<00:03:10.540> now<00:03:11.540> after<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:12.079> are<00:03:12.109> done

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
sort of compromise now after we are done

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.860 
sort of compromise now after we are done
in<00:03:12.650> after-effects<00:03:13.370> we<00:03:13.640> just<00:03:13.939> add<00:03:14.180> them<00:03:14.420> all<00:03:14.629> to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
in after-effects we just add them all to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.199 
in after-effects we just add them all to
the<00:03:14.989> new<00:03:15.140> compass<00:03:15.680> usual<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.519> render<00:03:16.790> out<00:03:16.969> the

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
the new compass usual and render out the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.809 
the new compass usual and render out the
pro<00:03:17.420> res<00:03:17.629> files<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.890> can<00:03:19.099> take<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.340> while<00:03:19.579> so

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
pro res files this can take a while so

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.179 
pro res files this can take a while so
plan<00:03:20.209> ahead<00:03:20.359> I<00:03:20.689> simply<00:03:21.260> let<00:03:21.409> it<00:03:21.470> render<00:03:21.799> while

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
plan ahead I simply let it render while

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.360 
plan ahead I simply let it render while
I<00:03:22.220> have<00:03:22.609> better<00:03:22.939> things<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.480> do<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:24.709> Premiere

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
I have better things to do in Premiere

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.880 
I have better things to do in Premiere
they<00:03:25.670> act<00:03:25.879> just<00:03:26.299> like<00:03:26.420> regular<00:03:26.870> progress<00:03:27.650> and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
they act just like regular progress and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.550 
they act just like regular progress and
if<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.640> have<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.819> pocket<00:03:29.299> camera<00:03:29.510> or<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.930> cinema

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
if you have a pocket camera or a cinema

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.709 
if you have a pocket camera or a cinema
camera<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.159> progress<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.909> progress<00:03:32.480> made

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:32.719 
camera the progress and progress made

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.229 
camera the progress and progress made
from<00:03:33.019> raw<00:03:33.319> will<00:03:33.889> look<00:03:34.099> pretty<00:03:34.549> much<00:03:34.670> identical

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.759 

unfortunately<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.480> me<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.079> production

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
unfortunately for me the production

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.920 
unfortunately for me the production
cameras<00:03:40.189> lock<00:03:40.459> footage<00:03:40.879> looks<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.480> little<00:03:41.659> bit

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
cameras lock footage looks a little bit

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.140 
cameras lock footage looks a little bit
different<00:03:42.439> so<00:03:42.859> I<00:03:42.919> will<00:03:43.129> need<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.400> correct<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.970> a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
different so I will need to correct it a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.420 
different so I will need to correct it a
tad<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:45.319> I<00:03:45.349> have<00:03:45.560> found<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.010> example

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
tad but I have found that for example

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.030 
tad but I have found that for example
when<00:03:46.760> using<00:03:47.239> film<00:03:47.569> convert<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.829> use

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
when using film convert I can just use

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.300 
when using film convert I can just use
the<00:03:49.189> preset<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.150> 2.5<00:03:51.019> k<00:03:51.349> camera<00:03:51.769> instead

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
the preset for the 2.5 k camera instead

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.520 
the preset for the 2.5 k camera instead
and<00:03:52.579> lower<00:03:52.939> the<00:03:53.269> temperature<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> bit<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.319> then

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
and lower the temperature a bit and then

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.480 
and lower the temperature a bit and then
they<00:03:54.980> are<00:03:55.099> already<00:03:55.609> very<00:03:56.150> intercapital
