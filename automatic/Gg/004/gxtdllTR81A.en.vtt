00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.500
 let's present the main 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.630
 concepts related to surveillance 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 epidemiological 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.470
 first of all we define vigilance 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
 epidemiological as the set of 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.610
 research will perform 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
 systematic way over a certain 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 population of animals the goal is 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 detect the presence of one or several 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.790
 diseases through tests 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.220
 Diagnostics must be taken into account that 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.090
 he hears you consider sometimes in place 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.820
 of diseases 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.529
 infections with or without symptoms is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.529
 say the presence of the pathogen 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.580
 the reason for performing the surveillance 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.410
 epidemiological is the early control of 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.150
 disease outbreaks that can produce 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.220
 epidemics in the population and entail 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.020
 important economic losses and 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.600
 ecological and sometimes 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 they can also produce important 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 impact on human public health by 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.000
 that reason the world organization of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.950
 It approved a series of trade agreements 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.720
 sanitary and phytosanitary measures will 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.000
 regulate international trade and 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.590
 avoid this kind of impact 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.750
 in the case of animal diseases 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.540
 it was the world health organization 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.950
 animal the oie the one in charge of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.220
 develop the regulations in the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.350
 protocols to follow and implemented them 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 through its codes the health 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 aquatic animals and animals 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.040
 therefore the goal of these 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.080
 surveillance systems is first 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.020
 place to try to demonstrate the absence of 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.330
 illness once achieved should be 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740
 continue to continue with these programs 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.869
 of epidemiological surveillance for 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.940
 keep the status of free of said 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.680
 disease in the event that the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.020
 disease was detected in the population 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.119
 it is important to conduct studies 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.670
 specific to know how to 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.210
 distributed in the population said 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.210
 disease 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.130
 according to that the different systems of 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.750
 epidemiological surveillance can be 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.600
 first place surveillance systems 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.360
 passive based on a notification 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.119
 immediate and mandatory before any 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.819
 outbreak or suspicion of the disease or 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.220
 an unexplained mortality increase in 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.750
 those cases it is necessary to make a 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.000
 epidemiological investigation for 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.000
 clarify the causes of said problem 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.069
 a more advanced and more complete system 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.400
 it consists in complementing the measures 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.560
 previous with an active search of 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.569
 clinical disease in the population is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.730
 say when we find animals 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.129
 sick or with symptoms compatible with 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.110
 the disease studied we should take 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.440
 samples to diagnose in the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.440
 laboratory 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.019
 the last level would correspond to a 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.209
 directed or specific surveillance is 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.459
 tries to combine the measures of the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.769
 passive and active systems with a take 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.659
 of samples required to search the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.989
 infection by diagnostic method 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.940
 reference laboratory on 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.069
 samples of sick animals when 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.049
 said sick animals is not found 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.709
 the population we will take a sample of 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.709
 healthy animals 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.510
 therefore epidemiology is going to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.849
 provide the answer to a series of 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.380
 important questions that are asked 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.450
 when we work in a system of 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.370
 epidemiological surveillance the first of 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.310
 is to know if the disease was the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.489
 pathogen is absent or present in the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.110
 certain population this corresponds to 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.760
 detection methodology 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.250
 disease that we will see in this first 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.980
 block and that allows us to perform 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.230
 surveillance programs to find and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.269
 to declare 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.909
 of disease-free status or 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.769
 carry out eradication programs 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.989
 however when the disease is 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.420
 demonstrated in a population is necessary 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.430
 know how many patients there is to say 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.989
 will correspond to the methodology of 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.460
 prevalence calculation that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.560
 corresponds to the module of this one 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.780
 and it is usual in the reality of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 control programs to validate your 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.350
 justification is also important 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.940
 perform another type of studies to 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.280
 know what variables are involved 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.110
 in this variability and presentation of 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.490
 the disease and corresponds to the 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.650
 methodology of evaluation of factors of 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.740
 risk that will be seen in more courses 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.740
 advanced 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.260
 therefore the elements that we are going to 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.100
 have to take into account when performing 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.120
 this series of epidemiological studies 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.670
 surveillance are on one side of the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.920
 Sampling must be taken into account within 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.530
 of sampling both the methodology for 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.610
 collect and select the sample as the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.730
 number of individuals that have to 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.010
 sample ie the sample size 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.200
 On the other hand it is important to know the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.060
 diagnostic reliability of the test that 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.130
 we are using and we will also have 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.420
 consider some aspects related 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.560
 with the calculation of the results 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.040
 obtained from said data 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.040
 provided by study 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.670
 The main differences 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.230
 methodologies between the two methods of 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.720
 disease detection and calculation of 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.820
 prevalence are in terms of the method of 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.830
 sampling in the detection of disease 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.660
 we know a probabilistic method based 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.920
 on objective criteria in order to 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.050
 increase the probability of finding a 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.190
 sick or infected animal while 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.510
 in the calculation of trying on cya is 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.340
 mandatory to use a method 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.790
 probabilistic either random or 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.320
 systematic 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.270
 in the size of samples 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.340
 they use different formulas in the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 first case it is important to have in 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.940
 account the minimum possible prevalence and 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.250
 the size of the population while 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.350
 in the second case it is important to estimate 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.480
 an expected prevalence in the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.040
 population and establish a level of 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.900
 precision to the extent that we're going to 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.030
 perform and in terms of reliability 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.770
 diagnosis to detect the disease 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.090
 it is important to work with tests 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.100
 Diagnostics of maximum sensitivity 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.290
 possible while calculating 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.540
 prevalence what we need is 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.820
 know the sensitivity and specialty 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.990
 to be able to make the appropriate adjustments 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.990
 thank you very much for your attention
