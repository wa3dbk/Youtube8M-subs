00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.630
 hi to all and same time for a 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.950
 third tutorial but today like 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.660
 you could see in the inscriptions 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.720
 we are going to make cannons finally a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.750
 canoe to tnt so that's gone we get 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.570
 found on the map 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.269
 that's it and so for that you a block 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.150
 any one so not on it has 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:43.300
 then of course tnt and a 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.090
 upstream lighter and finally ladders 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.770
 finally a scale more exactly so 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.440
 the block does not care which one does not care 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:56.559
 you take it and you put like those 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.219
 ci of 3,4 so one two three four and 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.469
 a fifth here 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.250
 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.649
 here I forgot to say that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.020
 also deure excuse me so we take 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.200
 water now we put the water 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.310
 here it's going to run we take to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.610
 the ladder to stop the water we have 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.860
 asked here like this now we're going 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.170
 prepare other channels we put the TNT 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.740
 here and here like those whose call side 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.329
 of the ladder and on the ladder the canoe 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.490
 tnt is ready now they were 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.729
 used so many situations it's 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.880
 quite simple you take a lighter we have 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.250
 had the first tnt first brick 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.649
 and we wait until it lights up six times 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.820
 to see the flash six times and 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.799
 we see the flash six times we have 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.659
 even the second the second phase has 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:54.600
 projected by the first and will explode 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:58.840
 at the end I show you so 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.729
 but here is a little shifted 1 so we 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:11.759
 try to do them if you want that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:11.759
 I am better 12.4 6 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.709
 it's not quite that we'll try 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:32.820
 to do with the reds are in europe 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:34.740
 it's gone again it's more or 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.840
 less here it is I showed you how 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.130
 to make an athena canon to subscribe to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.580
 put a sudden buzz that always 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.630
 pleasure 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.630
 goodbye and see you soon
