00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.230
 under my name is him and there she is 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.320
 One Weekly Risk Trade Up Series 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 today it gets damn interesting me 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.510
 have here 10x m14 train based this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 state all in natural means like us 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.940
 have the chance on an ak-47 wales 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.780
 the rebellious and should be the fn too 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.690
 then we have about 50 euro profit 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.239
 if not then we have one 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.640
 loss and should we do that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 haiti 2004 we got emmental 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.870
 really a problem and then that is 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.399
 loss is 15 euros big and that's it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.929
 yes, that's stupid 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.820
 we say it so if we waste and 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:48.120
 Revel got what should actually 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.280
 Only 50 50 should have chance then 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.909
 we also have a damn high chance of that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.679
 the fn is one can not but 100 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.899
 say percent because my world is yes 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.719
 nothing whatsoever 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.670
 is constant and therefore is airways 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.700
 picture really too open because that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.620
 can go really well but also stop 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.680
 right one must actually say 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.960
 yes make the maximum loss over 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.689
 It could be loss of about 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.790
 15 euros maybe 20 and that's it 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.460
 Definitely worth it for one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.310
 so great chance for a huge profit 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.259
 I mean that 's actually 50 50 here 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.789
 So with it's a 50 50 chance 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.289
 Officially this is exactly what is white 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.740
 Of course no one but I just say 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.320
 times 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.850
 We can contract on two items and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.229
 each of these old should be a 50 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.789
 say I do not know 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 if that is so, but I'll go away once 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.560
 should look like and therefore it applies now 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.890
 to really hope that this is here 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 Well , because that's me 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.370
 So make the 20 euro loss 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.020
 Could be there in any case 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.540
 say in time that is now such a 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.140
 bit as possible is a bit 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.550
 yes our choir had connected like 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.390
 one in such an orange signature here 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.190
 we have to do that somehow now 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 I can not do anything when I'm in that way 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.240
 a graffiti but i can not get graffiti 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.780
 I used to be that kind of 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.850
 because of 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.330
 I do not care how it stands there 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.380
 So the gangster sign 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.410
 shit i can not do a graffiti look 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 but no matter that it had something like that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.130
 be painted out 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.180
 I will not quite do it yet 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.190
 have to wait a little longer 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.370
 To see the weapon I have it 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.080
 a bit more exciting overall yes me 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.569
 I can already picture it is not quite so 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.470
 is my strength bit above normal 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.660
 but everything in the green area 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.519
 So if we can do the most now 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.200
 get and that's really really fm 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.530
 then we really had risk 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.819
 if the amaryllis then we have directly 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.450
 So that's not right anymore 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.010
 Cool and say the chances are good 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.250
 that signature is always 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.010
 really quiet and up here that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.630
 everything is also messy 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.019
 messy from what is a chain 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.880
 weapon 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.150
 It has to be right, he has to 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.989
 as if scratched by 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.910
 any funny scenes without that 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.000
 because of the very tough people in store 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.040
 a court did not look that way 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.110
 now with comeback I'm curious 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.410
 it can, as I said, run really well 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.269
 but also it can only really be correct 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.260
 Good to walk properly in the pants go that 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.290
 now to see relatively 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.549
 but I am good things now because of me 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.959
 think we have signed well 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.820
 That's something you can be proud of 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.820
 and now it's bidding and 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:44.070
 at least they are yes well, yes 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.620
 not for nothing as a risk game 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.600
 but I probably thought at some point 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.340
 not voted any detail 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.130
 not true 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.790
 it was a shame that it would have been so good for me 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.920
 us 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.960
 well you can not do anything thank you 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.060
 but watch it for yourself how are it 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.120
 then on today in livestream yes from 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.130
 20 o'clock is meeting point ev / cinemas who 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.690
 then definitely not me 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.620
 already disappointed because the signature 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.290
 which in any case has the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.860
 actually fit 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.860
 until the next video
