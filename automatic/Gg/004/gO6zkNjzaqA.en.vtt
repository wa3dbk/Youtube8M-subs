this<00:00:13.980> works<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.370> now<00:00:14.730> you're<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.540> are<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
this works right now you're here are the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.390 
this works right now you're here are the
settings<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.650> extraction<00:00:17.220> mode

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
settings you have the extraction mode

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.220 
settings you have the extraction mode
for<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> PDF<00:00:18.119> see<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> minimum<00:00:18.779> image

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
for the PDF see at the minimum image

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.130 
for the PDF see at the minimum image
size<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.820> set<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.810> only

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
size you can actually set this to only

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.109 
size you can actually set this to only
capture<00:00:22.560> images<00:00:22.949> which<00:00:23.400> meet<00:00:23.699> these

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
capture images which meet these

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.300 
capture images which meet these
requirements<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.439> image<00:00:26.070> size<00:00:26.279> has

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
requirements here so the image size has

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.000 
requirements here so the image size has
to<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.000> least<00:00:27.029> 100<00:00:27.449> pixels<00:00:28.019> either<00:00:28.349> with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
to be at least 100 pixels either with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
to be at least 100 pixels either with
width<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.849> height<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.420> both<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.109> choose<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
width or height or both if you choose to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.440 
width or height or both if you choose to
set<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> label

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
set it like that then you have the label

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.819 
set it like that then you have the label
fade-out<00:00:33.840> delay<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> viewer

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
fade-out delay you have the viewer

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.799 
fade-out delay you have the viewer
background<00:00:35.430> textures<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.540> viewer

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
background textures the viewer

background white label these are

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.560 
background white label these are
basically<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:40.010> aesthetic<00:00:41.570> functions

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
basically just more aesthetic functions

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.670

functionality<00:00:44.930> difference<00:00:45.930> when<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.559> comes

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
functionality difference when it comes

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
functionality difference when it comes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
here if like I said if it meets the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
here if like I said if it meets the
minimum<00:01:10.670> image<00:01:11.670> size<00:01:12.030> requirement<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.810> it's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
minimum image size requirement then it's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
minimum image size requirement then it's
going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> pull<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.530> those<00:01:13.680> images<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.340> on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
going to pull up all those images now on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.999 
going to pull up all those images now on
idb<00:01:15.630> all<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> images<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.740> small

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
idb all of the images are really small

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.590 
idb all of the images are really small
because<00:01:17.280> we're<00:01:17.430> using<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.729> mobile<00:01:17.939> view<00:01:18.360> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
because we're using a mobile view so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.120 
because we're using a mobile view so
you're<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> find<00:01:19.530> many<00:01:19.770> images

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you're not going to find many images

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
you're not going to find many images
here<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.850> meet<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> criteria<00:01:21.180> notice

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
here that meet the criteria notice

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
here that meet the criteria notice
there's<00:01:22.380> only<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.710> image<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.130> there's
