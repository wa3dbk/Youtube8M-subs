00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
to know from you for this video

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.140 
to know from you for this video
particularly<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.370> retirin<00:00:14.730> settings

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
particularly is is my retirin settings

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.320 
particularly is is my retirin settings
ok<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.809> mean<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:17.100> good<00:00:17.310> enough<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.300> only

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
ok I mean are they good enough the only

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.269 
ok I mean are they good enough the only
reason<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.439> render<00:00:19.770> settings<00:00:20.160> at

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
reason I have these render settings at

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.210 
reason I have these render settings at
this<00:00:20.640> rate<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.930> takes<00:00:22.350> me<00:00:22.590> longer<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
this rate because it takes me longer to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.790 
this rate because it takes me longer to
upload<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.240> internet<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.439> would<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
upload with my internet then it would to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.859 
upload with my internet then it would to
render<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.090> seems<00:00:27.300> crazy<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
render and I know it seems crazy for a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
render and I know it seems crazy for a
lot<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.260> guys<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:29.220> my<00:00:29.369> laptop<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.029> my

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
lot of you guys but my laptop or my

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.620 
lot of you guys but my laptop or my
mom's<00:00:30.449> laptop<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.700> really<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.910> bad<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mom's laptop is really not that bad of a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.889 
mom's laptop is really not that bad of a
laptop<00:00:34.460> it's<00:00:35.460> ok<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> best<00:00:36.660> but

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
laptop it's ok it's not the best but

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.619 
laptop it's ok it's not the best but
it's<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.800> pretty<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.300> my

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it's it's pretty good I think in my

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's it's pretty good I think in my
personal<00:00:40.110> opinions<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:42.649> my<00:00:43.649> Internet's<00:00:44.070> bad

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
personal opinions and my Internet's bad

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340 
personal opinions and my Internet's bad
so<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.030> two<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> make<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so the two of them kind of make it that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.709 
so the two of them kind of make it that
takes<00:00:47.280> me<00:00:47.430> longer<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.879> render<00:00:48.030> than<00:00:48.329> upload

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
takes me longer to render than upload

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.770 
takes me longer to render than upload
but<00:00:49.910> no<00:00:50.910> actually<00:00:51.270> takes<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.480> longer<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
but no actually takes me longer to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
but no actually takes me longer to
upload<00:00:51.899> than<00:00:52.230> render<00:00:52.730> my<00:00:53.730> bad<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:55.489> yeah<00:00:56.489> that's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
upload than render my bad so yeah that's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.279 
upload than render my bad so yeah that's
why<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.149> render<00:00:57.449> settings<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
why my render settings like that but I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.689 
why my render settings like that but I
think<00:00:58.320> they're<00:00:58.649> ok<00:00:58.949> especially<00:00:59.190> since<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
think they're ok especially since I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.189 
think they're ok especially since I
turned<00:00:59.760> up<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.809> 1080i<00:01:02.690> but<00:01:03.690> yeah<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
turned up it to 1080i but yeah and I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.070 
turned up it to 1080i but yeah and I
know<00:01:04.260> an<00:01:04.470> HD<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> guys<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.549> watch<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.909> HD

know an HD if you guys can watch in HD

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.030 
know an HD if you guys can watch in HD

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it'll be a lot better now since we're

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.789 
it'll be a lot better now since we're
done<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.840> I'm<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:13.049> talk<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.260> this

bigger harder tails 12 you will not like
this<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.520> probably<00:01:41.820> because<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.590> it's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this one probably because it's it's

open-world<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.030> slow<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.780> to

open-world and it's slow and you have to
be<00:01:45.990> stealthy<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.710> awesome<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
be stealthy and it's awesome and as you

realistic<00:03:44.940> as<00:03:45.419> the<00:03:45.569> hunter<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.139> it's<00:03:46.349> more

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
realistic as the hunter but it's more

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.220 
realistic as the hunter but it's more
realistic<00:03:47.250> than<00:03:47.639> any<00:03:47.940> Cabela's<00:03:48.359> game<00:03:48.540> ever

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
realistic than any Cabela's game ever

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.809 
realistic than any Cabela's game ever
and<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.919> lot<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.160> people<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.609> old

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and I know a lot of people like the old

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.289 
and I know a lot of people like the old
ones<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.680> begging<00:03:52.680> pottery<00:03:52.949> 2004<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.849> older

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
ones like begging pottery 2004 the older

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.259 
ones like begging pottery 2004 the older
ones<00:03:54.660> early<00:03:55.410> 2000s<00:03:56.069> this<00:03:56.699> is<00:03:56.819> one<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.000> think<00:03:57.060> is

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
ones early 2000s this is one I think is

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.520 
ones early 2000s this is one I think is
even<00:03:57.389> better<00:03:57.660> because<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.049> has<00:03:58.079> great

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
even better because it has great

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.780 
even better because it has great
graphics<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.190> stuff

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
graphics and stuff

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.909 
graphics and stuff
I<00:03:59.819> think<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.810> has<00:04:00.900> better<00:04:01.139> graphics<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.709> call

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
I think it has better graphics and call

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.140 
I think it has better graphics and call
of<00:04:02.010> duty<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.459> an<00:04:02.609> open-world<00:04:03.090> game<00:04:03.389> but

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
of duty and it's an open-world game but

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.640 
of duty and it's an open-world game but
