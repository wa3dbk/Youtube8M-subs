really important to train up your
training<00:00:57.129> or<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:58.840> change<00:00:58.870> up<00:00:59.770> your<00:00:59.800> training<00:01:00.309> a

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
training or to change up your training a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.660 
training or to change up your training a
little<00:01:01.210> bit<00:01:01.329> because<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.859> do<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.160> same<00:01:03.399> thing

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
little bit because you do the same thing

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.130 
little bit because you do the same thing
over<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.030> over<00:01:04.210> again<00:01:04.390> it's<00:01:04.720> going<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.050> get

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
over and over again it's going to get

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.190 
over and over again it's going to get
boring<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.460> that's<00:01:07.180> why<00:01:07.420> if<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.750> have<00:01:07.930> sharp

level<00:01:50.110> 1<00:01:50.290> 20<00:01:50.590> before<00:01:51.030> LHC<00:01:52.030> came<00:01:52.270> out<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:52.780> some

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
level 1 20 before LHC came out so some

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.380 
level 1 20 before LHC came out so some
things<00:01:53.470> might<00:01:53.890> have<00:01:54.010> changed<00:01:54.040> but<00:01:54.550> what<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.180> did

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
things might have changed but what I did

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.180 
things might have changed but what I did
I<00:01:55.570> think<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:55.990> might<00:01:56.080> still<00:01:56.350> be<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.530> same<00:01:56.560> just

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
I think it might still be the same just

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.150 
I think it might still be the same just
hearing<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:57.940> out<00:01:58.210> sharp<00:01:59.050> eyes<00:01:59.230> I'm<00:01:59.500> Max's

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
hearing this out sharp eyes I'm Max's

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.920 
hearing this out sharp eyes I'm Max's
first<00:02:00.370> it's<00:02:00.730> pretty<00:02:00.940> important<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.570> probably

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
first it's pretty important and probably

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.930 
first it's pretty important and probably
pretty<00:02:02.140> important<00:02:02.590> now<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.770> see<00:02:03.100> because<00:02:03.640> it's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
pretty important now I see because it's

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.820 
pretty important now I see because it's
a<00:02:04.000> party<00:02:04.330> skill<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.810> everyone<00:02:05.170> wants<00:02:05.530> sharp

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
a party skill and everyone wants sharp

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
eyes so I maxed out sharp eyes and then

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.550

maxing<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.549> little<00:02:37.670> bit<00:02:37.849> late<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.269> that's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
maxing it a little bit late but that's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.959 
maxing it a little bit late but that's
what<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> did<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.439> just<00:02:40.010> held<00:02:40.310> off<00:02:40.459> with<00:02:40.670> level

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
what I did I just held off with level

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
one while the robust maybe because I

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.000 
one while the robust maybe because I
wasn't<00:02:44.569> training<00:02:44.930> at<00:02:45.019> LHC<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.709> i'm<00:02:45.829> not<00:02:45.950> sure

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
wasn't training at LHC but i'm not sure

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.110 
wasn't training at LHC but i'm not sure
you<00:02:46.250> might<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.549> check<00:02:46.579> that<00:02:46.790> out<00:02:46.849> guys

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
you might want to check that out guys

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.379 
you might want to check that out guys

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.860 
wild instinct because again enemy
defense<00:02:54.230> ignored<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.310> twenty<00:02:56.090> percent<00:02:56.480> so

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
defense ignored is twenty percent so

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.690 
defense ignored is twenty percent so
really<00:02:57.169> stabilizes<00:02:57.799> your<00:02:57.829> damage<00:02:58.250> again<00:02:58.459> and

is<00:03:02.120> probably<00:03:02.599> one<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.840> my<00:03:02.959> favorite<00:03:03.620> skills

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
is probably one of my favorite skills

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.849 
is probably one of my favorite skills
being<00:03:05.150> maxed<00:03:05.689> now<00:03:05.900> check<00:03:06.169> this<00:03:06.319> out<00:03:06.530> guys<00:03:07.180> so

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
being maxed now check this out guys so

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.830 
being maxed now check this out guys so
my<00:03:09.859> damaged<00:03:10.250> range<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:11.409> 24,000<00:03:12.409> about<00:03:12.790> highest

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
my damaged range is 24,000 about highest

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.809 
my damaged range is 24,000 about highest
alright<00:03:14.840> that's<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.200> kind<00:03:15.409> of<00:03:15.469> was<00:03:16.159> just<00:03:16.340> MW

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
alright that's this kind of was just MW

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.949 
alright that's this kind of was just MW
there<00:03:17.000> as<00:03:17.150> well<00:03:17.389> and<00:03:17.599> then<00:03:18.379> I<00:03:18.739> will<00:03:19.419> pop<00:03:20.419> on<00:03:20.629> few

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
there as well and then I will pop on few

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.240 
there as well and then I will pop on few
on<00:03:21.109> desert<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:22.159> will<00:03:22.280> go<00:03:22.459> up<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:23.680> 32,000<00:03:24.680> so

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
on desert and it will go up to 32,000 so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.250 
on desert and it will go up to 32,000 so
that's<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.549> pretty<00:03:25.970> big<00:03:26.299> difference<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:26.930> so

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
that's a pretty big difference there so

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.259 
that's a pretty big difference there so
it<00:03:27.889> really<00:03:28.280> helps<00:03:28.579> out<00:03:28.699> your<00:03:28.879> training<00:03:29.120> range

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
it really helps out your training range

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.500 
it really helps out your training range
plus<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.799> cooldown<00:03:31.220> time<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.639> about<00:03:31.939> 120

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
plus the the cooldown time is about 120

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.089 
plus the the cooldown time is about 120
seconds<00:03:33.010> yeah<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.189> it's<00:03:34.310> 120<00:03:34.790> seconds<00:03:35.120> because

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
seconds yeah so it's 120 seconds because

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.539 
seconds yeah so it's 120 seconds because
the<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.760> duration<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.359> 120<00:03:38.989> seconds<00:03:39.379> and<00:03:39.590> it's

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
the the duration is 120 seconds and it's

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.610 
the the duration is 120 seconds and it's
normal<00:03:41.299> cooldown<00:03:41.689> rate<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.079> about<00:03:42.260> four

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
normal cooldown rate is about four

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.089 
normal cooldown rate is about four
minutes<00:03:42.829> which<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.419> 240<00:03:44.419> seconds<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.169> when<00:03:45.979> you

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
minutes which is 240 seconds so when you

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.749 
minutes which is 240 seconds so when you
use<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.370> 420<00:03:47.120> seconds<00:03:47.629> it'll<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.870> cooling<00:03:48.349> down

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
use it 420 seconds it'll be cooling down

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.039 
use it 420 seconds it'll be cooling down
also<00:03:49.759> at<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.939> same<00:03:49.970> time<00:03:50.359> so<00:03:50.659> that's<00:03:50.840> great

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
also at the same time so that's great

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.309 
also at the same time so that's great
training<00:03:51.439> half<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.859> time<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.329> after<00:03:53.329> i<00:03:53.780> maxed

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
in chi nghia is about 400 mil right now

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.400 
in chi nghia is about 400 mil right now
which<00:04:26.659> is<00:04:26.690> pretty

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
which is pretty

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.060 
which is pretty
noxious<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:28.040> got<00:04:28.700> mine<00:04:28.910> for<00:04:29.150> 60<00:04:29.600> mil<00:04:29.950> seven<00:04:30.950> of

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
noxious I got mine for 60 mil seven of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.560 
noxious I got mine for 60 mil seven of
them<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.760> thought<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.120> was<00:04:32.300> pretty

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
them and I thought that was pretty

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.960 
them and I thought that was pretty
pricey<00:04:32.960> but<00:04:33.320> apparently<00:04:34.070> they<00:04:34.190> went<00:04:34.400> up<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.640> lot

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
pricey but apparently they went up a lot

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.450 
pricey but apparently they went up a lot
last<00:04:35.750> time<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.110> needed<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:36.470> wild<00:04:36.680> Arab<00:04:36.950> last<00:04:37.130> 30

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
last time I needed a wild Arab last 30

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.690 
last time I needed a wild Arab last 30
so<00:04:37.850> if<00:04:38.180> it's<00:04:38.420> pricey<00:04:39.160> skill<00:04:40.160> book<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.460> pricing

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
so if it's pricey skill book is pricing

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.550 
so if it's pricey skill book is pricing
you<00:04:40.910> can't<00:04:41.180> afford<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.630> skill<00:04:41.900> right<00:04:42.230> away

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
you can't afford the skill right away

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.640 
you can't afford the skill right away

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
20 and then move on to the next

important skill that you need to max

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.040 
important skill that you need to max
because<00:04:51.460> it's<00:04:52.460> some<00:04:52.790> your<00:04:53.330> training<00:04:53.780> all

those points being saved up they could

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.530 
those points being saved up they could
be<00:04:55.550> going<00:04:55.760> into<00:04:55.910> something<00:04:56.060> else<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.480> know

people<00:04:56.840> really<00:04:57.260> want<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:58.010> save<00:04:58.250> points

people really want you to save points

people really want you to save points
and<00:04:58.880> it's<00:04:59.000> good<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.210> save<00:04:59.450> points<00:04:59.810> but<00:05:00.020> if<00:05:00.290> you

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
and it's good to save points but if you

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.710 
and it's good to save points but if you
can<00:05:01.100> increase<00:05:01.310> another<00:05:01.580> skill<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.000> boost

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
can increase another skill that boost

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.320 
can increase another skill that boost
your<00:05:02.900> attack<00:05:03.320> range<00:05:03.620> you'll<00:05:04.610> be<00:05:05.060> getting<00:05:05.270> a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
your attack range you'll be getting a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.410 
your attack range you'll be getting a
lot<00:05:05.480> more<00:05:05.510> exp<00:05:06.080> you'll<00:05:06.710> be<00:05:06.860> training<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.520> lot

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
lot more exp you'll be training a lot

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.780 
lot more exp you'll be training a lot
faster<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:09.020> more<00:05:09.140> efficiently<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.370> it<00:05:10.640> might

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
faster and more efficiently so it might

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.580 
faster and more efficiently so it might
just<00:05:10.970> be<00:05:11.150> worth<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.600> put<00:05:11.900> those<00:05:12.080> points<00:05:12.470> and

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
just be worth it to put those points and

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.780 
just be worth it to put those points and
that<00:05:12.680> you're<00:05:12.800> saving<00:05:12.980> into<00:05:13.250> something<00:05:13.640> else

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
that you're saving into something else

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.750 
that you're saving into something else
so<00:05:14.120> if<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.360> can<00:05:14.570> only<00:05:14.690> get<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.960> SC<00:05:15.350> 2<00:05:15.500> 20<00:05:15.800> do<00:05:16.610> not
