00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
learned to wear my shop claws when I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.189 
learned to wear my shop claws when I
take<00:04:23.610> these<00:04:23.789> blanks<00:04:24.180> off<00:04:24.360> because<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.960> edge

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
take these blanks off because this edge

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.880 
take these blanks off because this edge
can<00:04:25.470> get<00:04:25.620> pretty<00:04:25.860> sharp<00:04:27.169> now<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.200> can<00:04:28.530> open<00:04:28.800> the

drawers up and remove the woodworm

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.490 
drawers up and remove the woodworm
then<00:04:32.000> I'll<00:04:32.120> close<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.510> draws<00:04:32.720> up<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.110> little<00:04:33.260> bit

then I'll close it draws up a little bit

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.900 
then I'll close it draws up a little bit
to<00:04:33.680> make<00:04:33.830> sure<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.130> they<00:04:34.310> fit<00:04:34.550> into<00:04:34.730> the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.380 
blank if you cut the recess to the right
depth<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:39.920> set<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.370> over<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.730> jaws<00:04:41.000> and

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
depth you can set it over to jaws and

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.390 
depth you can set it over to jaws and
it'll<00:04:41.780> stop<00:04:42.080> before<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.650> actually<00:04:42.800> hits<00:04:43.130> the
