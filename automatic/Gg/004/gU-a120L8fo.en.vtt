ingredients so you can see everything

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.030 
ingredients so you can see everything
that<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:35.060> within<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.630> meal<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:36.830> see

that is in within the meal and I can see
right<00:02:37.220> away<00:02:37.340> apple<00:02:37.820> juice<00:02:38.000> concentrate<00:02:38.030> right

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
right away apple juice concentrate right

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.220 
right away apple juice concentrate right
here<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.890> lot<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.160> corn<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> lot<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.230> oats

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
here but a lot of corn and a lot of oats

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.860 
here but a lot of corn and a lot of oats
and<00:02:42.620> all<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.040> stuff<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.700> there<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.360> good

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and all that stuff so there is a good

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.680 
and all that stuff so there is a good
variety<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.239> does<00:02:47.420> come

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
variety in this because it does come

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.470 
variety in this because it does come
with<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.900> lot<00:02:48.200> more<00:02:48.470> smaller<00:02:48.860> seeds<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.640> all

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
with a lot more smaller seeds and all

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.590 
with a lot more smaller seeds and all
that<00:02:50.720> stuff<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.190> then<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> bottom<00:02:53.269> it

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
that stuff and then on the bottom it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.650 
that stuff and then on the bottom it
just<00:02:53.780> has<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.230> guaranteed<00:02:54.769> analysis<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
just has the guaranteed analysis and the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.310 
just has the guaranteed analysis and the
crude<00:02:56.959> protein<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.890> 16<00:02:58.370> percent<00:02:58.750> fat<00:02:59.750> is<00:03:00.050> 3

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
crude protein is 16 percent fat is 3

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.030 
crude protein is 16 percent fat is 3
percent<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:00.950> fiber<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.580> 10<00:03:01.940> percent<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.650> do

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
percent and fiber is 10 percent so I do

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.479 
percent and fiber is 10 percent so I do
feel<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:05.180> food<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.560> bit<00:03:06.950> low<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
feel like this food is a bit low in the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.780 
feel like this food is a bit low in the
protein<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.300> in<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> fat<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:09.920> definitely

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
protein and in the fat so I definitely

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.860 
protein and in the fat so I definitely
would<00:03:11.660> recommend<00:03:11.739> mixing<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:13.100> in<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:14.239> your

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
would recommend mixing this in with your

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.850 
would recommend mixing this in with your
other<00:03:14.900> main<00:03:15.739> mix<00:03:16.070> food<00:03:16.430> because<00:03:17.239> this<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
other main mix food because this is a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.080 
other main mix food because this is a
bit<00:03:19.160> low<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.760> protein<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:21.260> fat<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.340> I

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
bit low on the protein and the fat and I

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.770 
bit low on the protein and the fat and I
would<00:03:23.299> not<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:24.620> give<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.070> as<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:26.299> main

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
would not just give this as the main

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.949 
would not just give this as the main
base<00:03:27.140> meal<00:03:27.500> for<00:03:28.100> your<00:03:28.220> hamster's<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.720> is

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
base meal for your hamster's this is

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.770 
base meal for your hamster's this is
made<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.470> USA<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.360> right<00:03:32.360> here<00:03:32.570> this

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
made in the USA and right here this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.380 
made in the USA and right here this
shows<00:03:33.049> their<00:03:34.010> website<00:03:34.579> and<00:03:34.790> all<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.299> I'm

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
shows their website and all that so I'm

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.420 
shows their website and all that so I'm
not<00:03:35.450> sure<00:03:35.600> like<00:03:36.079> if<00:03:36.620> other<00:03:37.010> people<00:03:37.280> from

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
not sure like if other people from

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.420 
not sure like if other people from
different<00:03:37.640> countries<00:03:38.739> have<00:03:39.739> issues<00:03:40.160> getting

different countries have issues getting

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.300 
different countries have issues getting
this<00:03:40.700> but<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.060> sure<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.390> can<00:03:41.450> get<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.870> on

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
this but I'm sure you can get it on

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.360 
this but I'm sure you can get it on
Amazon<00:03:43.310> eBay<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.299> other<00:03:44.870> websites<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:45.860> that

Amazon eBay and other websites but that

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.400

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
smart end it does have an airtight seal

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.750 
smart end it does have an airtight seal
which<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.650> great<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.190> don't<00:04:01.280> want<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.579> have

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
which is great you don't want to have

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.690 
which is great you don't want to have
any<00:04:02.299> tiny<00:04:02.810> little<00:04:03.049> bugs<00:04:03.320> or<00:04:03.560> any<00:04:03.739> ants<00:04:04.250> answer

any tiny little bugs or any ants answer

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.810 
any tiny little bugs or any ants answer
probably<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.420> worst<00:04:05.600> thing<00:04:05.959> possible<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:07.519> get

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
probably the worst thing possible to get

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.420 
probably the worst thing possible to get
into<00:04:08.060> food<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.450> stuff<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.260> definitely<00:04:10.100> am

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
into food and stuff so I definitely am

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.180 
into food and stuff so I definitely am
using<00:04:11.209> an<00:04:11.329> airtight<00:04:11.780> seal<00:04:11.829> container<00:04:12.829> and

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
using an airtight seal container and

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.700 
using an airtight seal container and
this<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.299> just<00:04:14.600> what<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
this is just what the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.080 
this is just what the
it<00:04:15.860> mix<00:04:16.310> looks<00:04:16.610> like<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.770> has<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.910> body

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
it mix looks like it just has the body

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.180 
it mix looks like it just has the body
craft<00:04:20.450> enhancing<00:04:20.930> hamster<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.620> together<00:04:21.740> and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
craft enhancing hamster and together and

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.730 
craft enhancing hamster and together and
I've<00:04:22.310> been<00:04:22.460> mixing<00:04:22.640> this<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.380> slowly<00:04:24.380> over<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
I've been mixing this in slowly over the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.810
