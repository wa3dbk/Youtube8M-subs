so<00:01:07.040> we're<00:01:07.250> going<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.490> see<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> future<00:01:08.180> very

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
so we're going to see a future very

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.899 
so we're going to see a future very
shortly<00:01:09.380> where<00:01:10.280> diabetes<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.840> norm<00:01:12.909> where

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
shortly where diabetes is the norm where

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.109 
shortly where diabetes is the norm where
everybody<00:01:14.869> here<00:01:15.380> today<00:01:15.850> everybody<00:01:16.850> who<00:01:17.000> say

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
everybody here today everybody who say

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.450 
everybody here today everybody who say
to<00:01:17.180> California<00:01:17.840> will<00:01:18.020> have<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> direct<00:01:18.460> family

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
to California will have a direct family

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.350 
to California will have a direct family
member<00:01:19.750> with<00:01:20.750> diabetes<00:01:21.850> one<00:01:22.850> thing<00:01:23.090> we<00:01:23.240> know

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
member with diabetes one thing we know

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.969 
member with diabetes one thing we know
about<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.720> demographics<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:24.440> California

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
about the demographics in California

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.639 
about the demographics in California
California<00:01:25.670> is<00:01:26.090> getting<00:01:26.360> browner<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.990> it's

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
California is getting browner and it's

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.279 
California is getting browner and it's
getting<00:01:27.799> older<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:29.299> rate<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.539> diabetes<00:01:29.720> is

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
getting older the rate of diabetes is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.800 
getting older the rate of diabetes is
highest<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.860> those<00:01:31.039> over<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.490> age<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.759> 60<00:01:32.210> so

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
highest in those over the age of 60 so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.429 
highest in those over the age of 60 so
we<00:01:32.960> can<00:01:33.140> say<00:01:33.320> for<00:01:33.380> sure<00:01:33.649> today<00:01:35.229> diabetes<00:01:36.229> is

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
we can say for sure today diabetes is

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.130 
we can say for sure today diabetes is
going<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.920> continue<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.369> grow<00:01:37.759> rapidly<00:01:38.420> in
