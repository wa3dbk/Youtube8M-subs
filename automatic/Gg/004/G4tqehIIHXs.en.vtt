00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.870
 well we are here in another test 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.849
 speed and good because this time is a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.699
 unusual test since good we're going to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.230
 face two vehicles a little 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.269
 different because they are two vehicles of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.429
 different categories and well then this 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.869
 Once he accompanies me to see what happens in vais a 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.689
 see, let's go there 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 we have here the cow the cow 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.030
 tiger there yellow and black etc and good 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 so let's compare it against this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 against this car that is the ampa date 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.940
 helmet that is a new car that is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 unlocks making robberies to banks 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 which is a classic sports car and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.179
 obviously the back is a super car 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.949
 and you will say, my mother, is going to 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.899
 win the cow for a beating 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.160
 awesome because we are not going to see it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 the truth is that the athletic ran 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 very much so good let's do it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.839
 ok or gay good to the three of you have 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.519
 mother always but I'm ready come 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.030
 let's see we are here the lines well 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:08.760
 perfect 1/7 stick one 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.760
 3 as salt and perfect 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'm hanging out 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 I mean, what do you have to do with this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.319
 lad and lukaku the hand is not a plane or 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.000
 it is a free plane 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.920
 It is fair to say that also the two cars 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.799
 both attached to the maximum 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.049
 butt that is not missing pieces 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.909
 or nothing is all to the maximum but is that 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.429
 it is exaggerated the best is that they are 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 sports mother of mine asking 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.259
 After that, we are going to make one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.099
 skidding like this already in plan to finish 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.099
 so cool 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.100
 and afternoon 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.810
 this this straight has a curve to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.640
 background this notice just in case 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.530
 well now I throw the rest of weights 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.690
 audio let's see the challenge to the end 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 ok let's go to those who call a little 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.840
 of wheel here so pipe to the three 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.970
 we released the area law 123 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.410
 a saline one thousandth before you 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.680
 but it's the same 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.680
 my mother a second line 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 no no no no flip sign of peace not of 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:46.129
 peace are not angular exaggerated 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.950
 what madness that crazy madness scolding 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.319
 and it is known that grabs more you know if not 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.459
 no no 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.910
 comes out with more strength is that it is 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.380
 exaggeration the truth is that good the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.170
 car we could say that he runs a lot 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.060
 a lot but a lot 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.310
 apart from having a sound the truth is 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.310
 that very cool also sounds 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.430
 it's supposed to be an Italian car but 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.569
 he has a sleepwalker there as if he were 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.720
 American there the monkey is a car this 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.000
 It's American and well the truth is that it has 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.160
 been a ts that good I expected that 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 out to win the backup by quite 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.360
 although good we wanted to try it 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.190
 because we were running here to vÃ©lez 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.799
 and today we are going to try it because it runs 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.569
 quite and we have tried with elba that 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.180
 obviously with translates environment one of 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.489
 Obviously not not worth it 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.190
 because we are doing there is color but 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.290
 against this car that is a super but 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.640
 of the ones a little lower to say it 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.700
 somehow the truth is that it runs 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.769
 practically the same and it is also that 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.319
 over the second when I have the 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.480
 second pass and then already when to have 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.060
 thrown a lot or in a long march 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.060
 makes another shot more you know or is it something 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.769
 that is going very well so good guys 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.750

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.000
 this test if you want to propose masters 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.830
 what do you want us to do 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.630
 with other vehicles or for example with 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.310
 this vehicle is the practices against 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.079
 another so you say good this can 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.060
 be equal because you can leave me 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.680
