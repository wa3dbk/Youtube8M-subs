00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
once the cars lost in the deck it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.190 
once the cars lost in the deck it
becomes<00:01:34.789> more<00:01:34.969> challenging<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:35.960> four

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
bit and if we place the four kings on

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.809 
bit and if we place the four kings on
top<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.369> deck<00:01:46.520> just<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.119> just<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.749> wave

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
top of the deck just like so just a wave
