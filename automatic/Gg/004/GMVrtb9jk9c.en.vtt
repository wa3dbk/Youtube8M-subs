there are quite a few cause I'm

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
there are quite a few cause I'm
undercover<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> thought<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.890> cover<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
undercover but I thought I just cover a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
undercover but I thought I just cover a
few<00:00:29.519> were<00:00:29.670> forest<00:00:30.179> once<00:00:30.449> today<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:31.140> it'll

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
few were forest once today because it'll

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.490 
few were forest once today because it'll
quite<00:00:31.590> exciting<00:00:32.570> show<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.719> first<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.260> got

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
quite exciting show up first we've got

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
quite exciting show up first we've got
Lars<00:00:34.800> eldric<00:00:35.430> who<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.270> signed<00:00:36.600> from<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.989> he

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
Lars eldric who we signed from it he

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
Lars eldric who we signed from it he
really<00:00:37.800> said<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.399> transfer<00:00:38.760> window<00:00:38.790> it'll

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
really said this transfer window it'll

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
really said this transfer window it'll
think<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> transfers<00:00:40.110> fields<00:00:40.559> around<00:00:40.710> final

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
think the transfers fields around final

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
think the transfers fields around final
decay<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.180> could<00:00:42.329> rise<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.840> 1.5

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
decay but it could rise to about 1.5

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.040 
decay but it could rise to about 1.5
million<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> sure<00:00:45.360> he's<00:00:45.570> gonna<00:00:45.750> be

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
million and I'm not sure he's gonna be

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.020 
million and I'm not sure he's gonna be
definite<00:00:46.710> first<00:00:46.920> team<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.399> season<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
definite first team this season but

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
definite first team this season but
hopefully<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.660> put<00:00:49.379> his<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.649> into<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> front

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
hopefully can put his way into the front

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
hopefully can put his way into the front
first<00:00:50.489> team<00:00:50.789> she<00:00:51.390> looked<00:00:51.570> quite<00:00:51.719> exciting

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
first team she looked quite exciting

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
division and he's a big strong man so he

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.429 
division and he's a big strong man so he
should<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.940> very<00:01:03.180> nice<00:01:03.420> card<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:04.170> on

should be a very nice card to use on

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
should be a very nice card to use on
foot<00:01:04.890> alone<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.640> his<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.150> probably

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
foot alone with his you know probably

have<00:01:06.630> around<00:01:06.720> 90<00:01:07.290> strength<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:07.979> gonna<00:01:08.070> be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
have around 90 strength so it's gonna be

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
have around 90 strength so it's gonna be
a<00:01:08.280> big<00:01:08.520> target<00:01:08.760> run<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> target<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.289 
we'll have to hope he does well I maybe
get<00:01:12.600> himself<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.439> couple<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> goals<00:01:14.100> over<00:01:14.310> think

Hamburg<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:18.450> Michael<00:01:18.840> mansions<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
Hamburg now Michael mansions a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310 
Hamburg now Michael mansions a
centre-back<00:01:19.979> he's<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> rare<00:01:20.990> which<00:01:21.990> he<00:01:22.170> was

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
few open down by one but he should be a
