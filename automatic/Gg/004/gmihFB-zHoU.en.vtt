difficult you have to cut it all off

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.040 
difficult you have to cut it all off
because<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.970> all<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.330> piece<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:22.870> was

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
because it's all one piece this was

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.720 
because it's all one piece this was
quite<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.290> fiasco<00:02:23.590> between<00:02:24.190> all<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.520> the
