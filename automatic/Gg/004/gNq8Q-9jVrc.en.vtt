00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
alright here I'm using something I'm

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.860 
alright here I'm using something I'm
calling<00:00:40.519> dub<00:00:40.789> delay<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:41.329> really<00:00:41.600> like<00:00:41.750> that

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
calling dub delay I really like that

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.410 
calling dub delay I really like that
kind<00:00:42.019> of<00:00:42.140> reggae<00:00:42.559> stuff<00:00:43.489> where<00:00:43.730> they<00:00:43.760> really

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
kind of reggae stuff where they really

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.569 
kind of reggae stuff where they really
take<00:00:44.960> advantage<00:00:45.110> of<00:00:45.769> those<00:00:45.920> delays<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.519> the

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
take advantage of those delays and the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.270 
take advantage of those delays and the
big<00:00:46.820> reverb<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:48.199> is<00:00:48.320> kind<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.589> fun<00:00:48.860> I<00:00:49.100> like

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
big reverb so this is kind of fun I like

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.360 
big reverb so this is kind of fun I like
to<00:00:49.370> use<00:00:49.519> this<00:00:49.780> when<00:00:50.780> I'm<00:00:50.899> playing<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.620> big<00:00:52.129> long

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
to use this when I'm playing a big long

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.740 
to use this when I'm playing a big long
set<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.909> know<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.089> can<00:00:53.239> kind<00:00:53.360> of<00:00:53.420> mix<00:00:53.570> this

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
set you know you can kind of mix this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.959 
set you know you can kind of mix this
stuff<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.110> really<00:00:54.409> mix<00:00:55.159> up<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.489> night<00:00:55.670> and

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
stuff in really mix up the night and

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.000 
stuff in really mix up the night and
here's<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.269> great<00:00:56.479> way<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.719> do<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.680> add<00:00:57.799> in<00:00:57.920> a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
here's a great way to do it to add in a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.819 
here's a great way to do it to add in a
fun<00:00:58.309> way<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.519> use<00:00:58.670> delay<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.570> reverb<00:00:59.839> now<00:01:00.769> the

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
fun way to use delay and reverb now the

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.240 
fun way to use delay and reverb now the
trick<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:01.549> is<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.379> baste<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.979> kind<00:01:04.159> of

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
trick here is to baste it to kind of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.660 
trick here is to baste it to kind of
play<00:01:04.729> off<00:01:04.759> of<00:01:04.970> your<00:01:05.810> delay<00:01:06.170> rhythmically

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.639 

got<00:01:10.670> good<00:01:11.030> gun<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:12.050> good<00:01:12.380> tech<00:01:12.590> good<00:01:17.649> setting

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
got good gun to good tech good setting

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.120 
got good gun to good tech good setting
here<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.890> jumps<00:01:19.159> architect<00:01:20.020> get<00:01:21.159> that

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
here the jumps architect get that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.120 
here the jumps architect get that
triplets<00:01:25.130> right<00:01:25.190> papa<00:01:25.819> got<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.110> does<00:01:27.350> my<00:01:27.500> my

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
triplets right papa got that does my my

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.340 
triplets right papa got that does my my
delay<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.759> triplets<00:01:29.479> now<00:01:29.659> on<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:29.990> number<00:01:30.289> of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
delay is triplets now on a number of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.620 
delay is triplets now on a number of
delays<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.890> could<00:01:31.429> just<00:01:31.670> dial<00:01:31.909> in<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.240> triplet

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
delays I could just dial in a triplet

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.609 
delays I could just dial in a triplet
and<00:01:32.720> tap<00:01:32.929> it<00:01:33.110> in<00:01:34.450> that's<00:01:35.450> that's<00:01:36.259> cool<00:01:36.440> if<00:01:36.560> you

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
and tap it in that's that's cool if you

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.859 
and tap it in that's that's cool if you
have<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> triplet<00:01:37.159> on<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.549> your<00:01:37.700> delay<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.330> lot<00:01:38.750> of

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
have a triplet on on your delay a lot of

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.139 
have a triplet on on your delay a lot of
delays<00:01:39.140> don't<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.009> you're<00:01:40.729> going<00:01:40.879> to<00:01:40.910> try<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
delays don't so you're going to try to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.520 
delays don't so you're going to try to
do<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> little<00:01:41.450> by<00:01:41.629> ear<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.229> actually

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
do it a little by ear and it's actually

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.960 
do it a little by ear and it's actually
not<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.649> hard<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.129> just<00:01:43.220> want<00:01:43.459> to<00:01:43.489> go<00:01:43.610> hit

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
not that hard you just want to go hit

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.949 
not that hard you just want to go hit
the<00:01:44.090> note<00:01:45.489> right<00:01:46.489> dot<00:01:46.789> dot<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.599> can<00:01:47.780> base

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
the note right dot dot and you can base

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.540 
the note right dot dot and you can base
it<00:01:48.170> off<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.289> that<00:01:48.649> hearing<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.160> one<00:01:49.310> two

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
it off of that hearing just one two

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.210 
it off of that hearing just one two
three<00:01:49.910> two<00:01:50.149> two<00:01:50.179> two<00:01:50.720> two<00:01:50.750> two<00:01:51.050> three<00:01:51.560> four<00:01:51.979> two

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
three two two two two two three four two

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.770 
three two two two two two three four two
three<00:01:54.160> right<00:01:55.160> so<00:01:55.459> if<00:01:55.819> your<00:01:56.239> trip<00:01:56.479> if<00:01:56.629> your

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
three right so if your trip if your

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.419 
three right so if your trip if your
delay<00:01:57.110> doesn't<00:01:57.319> have<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> triplet<00:01:57.920> you're<00:01:58.190> not

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
delay doesn't have a triplet you're not

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.550 
delay doesn't have a triplet you're not
out<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.759> luck<00:01:59.179> it's<00:01:59.390> it's<00:01:59.750> uh<00:01:59.959> it's<00:01:59.989> easier<00:02:00.470> if

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
out of luck it's it's uh it's easier if

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.839 
out of luck it's it's uh it's easier if
it<00:02:00.590> does<00:02:00.770> but<00:02:00.979> if<00:02:01.069> it<00:02:01.160> doesn't<00:02:01.310> like<00:02:01.610> most

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
it does but if it doesn't like most

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.130 
it does but if it doesn't like most
don't<00:02:02.119> we're<00:02:02.509> good<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.810> go

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
don't we're good to go

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.499 
don't we're good to go
alright<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.009> I'm<00:02:04.250> using<00:02:04.489> once<00:02:05.060> again<00:02:05.360> I'm

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
alright so I'm using once again I'm

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.240 
alright so I'm using once again I'm
using<00:02:05.539> an<00:02:05.840> overdrive<00:02:06.289> just<00:02:06.590> because<00:02:06.860> that's

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
using an overdrive just because that's

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.889 
using an overdrive just because that's
that<00:02:07.459> kind<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.759> guitar<00:02:07.879> sound<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.420> little<00:02:08.509> dirty

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
that kind of guitar sound a little dirty

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.710 
that kind of guitar sound a little dirty
now<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.679> could<00:02:10.039> just<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:10.429> away<00:02:10.489> with<00:02:10.729> using<00:02:10.879> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
now I could just get away with using the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.780 
now I could just get away with using the
reverb<00:02:12.170> sort<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.709> delay<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.430> add<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
reverb sort of delay but if I add in the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.490 
reverb sort of delay but if I add in the
reverb<00:02:14.060> gives<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> definitely<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.080> wet

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
reverb gives it definitely that wet

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.550 
reverb gives it definitely that wet
sound<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.190> make<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:17.319> had<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.410> off

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
sound that you make and I had that off

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.520 
sound that you make and I had that off
there<00:02:18.709> numbered<00:02:19.900> see<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.019> if<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.200> turn<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
there numbered see now if I turn the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:32.110 
there numbered see now if I turn the
reverb<00:02:21.680> off<00:02:23.019> it's<00:02:24.019> not<00:02:24.290> as<00:02:24.440> cool<00:02:24.620> right

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.789 

okay<00:02:33.120> now<00:02:33.299> put<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.540> reverb<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.019> I've<00:02:34.319> got<00:02:34.769> a

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
okay now put that reverb on I've got a

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.350 
okay now put that reverb on I've got a
plate<00:02:35.159> I've<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> pretty<00:02:35.879> wet<00:02:36.060> let<00:02:36.209> me<00:02:36.269> turn

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
plate I've got a pretty wet let me turn

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.259 
plate I've got a pretty wet let me turn
off<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.480> play<00:02:37.640> there's<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.700> lot<00:02:38.849> there<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.090> could

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
off the play there's a lot there I could

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.850 
off the play there's a lot there I could
even<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.569> crazy<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.319> if<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.530> wanted

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
even go more crazy with that if I wanted

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.000 
even go more crazy with that if I wanted
to<00:02:41.480> okay<00:02:42.480> these<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.049> all<00:02:43.079> really<00:02:43.440> warm<00:02:43.680> sound

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
to okay these are all really warm sound

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.319 
to okay these are all really warm sound
so<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.220> don't<00:02:44.370> want<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.610> delay<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.879> be<00:02:45.030> really

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
so I don't want the delay to be really

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:45.830 
so I don't want the delay to be really
bright

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
bright

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.330 
bright
a<00:02:45.870> lot<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.379> sound<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:46.920> reggae<00:02:47.129> and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
a lot of that sound of that reggae and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:59.300 
a lot of that sound of that reggae and
dub<00:02:47.670> stuff<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.590> dark<00:02:50.299> so<00:02:58.040> if<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> look<00:02:59.280> at

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
dub stuff is a dark so if you look at

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.160 
dub stuff is a dark so if you look at
the<00:02:59.400> schematic<00:02:59.609> let's<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.450> delay<00:03:00.780> I'm

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the schematic let's have the delay I'm

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.740 
the schematic let's have the delay I'm
sorry<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.470> reverb<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:01.980> pretty<00:03:02.790> wet<00:03:03.000> I've<00:03:03.599> got

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
sorry the reverb on pretty wet I've got

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.839 
sorry the reverb on pretty wet I've got
that<00:03:03.900> delay<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.680> triplet<00:03:05.040> feel<00:03:05.549> I

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
that delay with that triplet feel I

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.970 
that delay with that triplet feel I
could<00:03:06.420> dial<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.140> wanted<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.680> it's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
could dial in if I wanted to but it's

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.979 
could dial in if I wanted to but it's
something<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.280> had<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> kind<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.700> ear<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.239> if

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
something you had a kind of ear and if

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.289 
something you had a kind of ear and if
you're<00:03:10.109> doing<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.440> tune<00:03:10.680> gig<00:03:11.579> sometimes<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.239> you

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
you're doing a tune gig sometimes if you

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.000 
you're doing a tune gig sometimes if you
don't<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.810> triplet<00:03:13.170> setting<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.650> would

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
don't have the triplet setting I would

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.099 
don't have the triplet setting I would
maybe<00:03:14.280> put<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.579> little<00:03:14.730> piece<00:03:14.909> of<00:03:15.150> tape<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.900> your

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
maybe put a little piece of tape on your

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.740 
maybe put a little piece of tape on your
delay<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.890> help<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.159> got<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.750> guesstimate

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
delay to help you got a guesstimate

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.089 
delay to help you got a guesstimate
where<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.200> going<00:03:19.379> to<00:03:19.470> be<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.799> then<00:03:19.890> if<00:03:20.010> you

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
where it's going to be and then if you

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.979 
where it's going to be and then if you
have<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> tap<00:03:20.459> delay<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:21.000> come<00:03:21.629> dial<00:03:21.870> in

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
have a tap delay you can come dial in

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.110 
have a tap delay you can come dial in
with<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> drummer<00:03:22.530> okay<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.909> of<00:03:24.000> my

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
with the drummer okay so and of my

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.830 
with the drummer okay so and of my
overdrive

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
overdrive

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.190 
overdrive
just<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.590> light<00:03:25.769> breakup<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.970> schematic<00:03:27.870> really

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
just a light breakup so schematic really

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.339 
just a light breakup so schematic really
obvious<00:03:28.620> overdrive<00:03:29.129> delay<00:03:29.819> reverb<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
obvious overdrive delay reverb and the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.449 
obvious overdrive delay reverb and the
trick<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.799> really<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.130> fun<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.430> a

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
trick you can really have fun as a

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.290 
trick you can really have fun as a
guitar<00:03:32.700> player<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.970> play<00:03:33.209> off<00:03:33.419> of<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.840> rhythm
