00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.420 
do use this as a smudge brush or like a
small<00:02:11.209> precision<00:02:11.599> precision<00:02:12.230> brush<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.099> i

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
small precision precision brush and i

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.930 
small precision precision brush and i
will<00:02:13.670> say<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.299> it's<00:02:15.140> about<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> same<00:02:15.799> as<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
will say that it's about the same as the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.839 
will say that it's about the same as the
precision<00:02:17.480> brush<00:02:17.720> or<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:19.220> studio<00:02:19.489> line

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
precision brush or one the studio line

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.340 
precision brush or one the studio line
is<00:02:20.150> actually<00:02:20.660> almost<00:02:21.849> identical

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
is actually almost identical

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.590 
is actually almost identical
if<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.920> see<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.190> too<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:25.150> almost<00:02:25.420> identical

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
if you see you too it's almost identical

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.280 
if you see you too it's almost identical
so<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.620> mean<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.220> don't<00:02:27.550> know<00:02:27.670> how<00:02:28.630> they<00:02:29.260> think

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
so I mean I don't know how they think

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.340 
so I mean I don't know how they think
that<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.950> concealer<00:02:30.490> brush<00:02:31.170> next<00:02:32.170> on

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
that this is a concealer brush next on

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.370 
that this is a concealer brush next on
to<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.710> studio<00:02:33.160> time<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.780> far<00:02:35.020> we<00:02:35.200> had

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
to the studio time this is so far we had

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.150 
to the studio time this is so far we had
that<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.920> precision<00:02:36.250> brush<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
that this is the precision brush if you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.320 
that this is the precision brush if you
see<00:02:39.570> it's<00:02:40.570> great<00:02:40.870> for<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:41.260> defining<00:02:42.330> right

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
see it's great for like defining right

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.490 
see it's great for like defining right
there<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.750> getting<00:02:44.710> in<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> corners<00:02:46.410> next<00:02:47.410> is

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
there and getting in the corners next is

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.360 
there and getting in the corners next is
the<00:02:47.530> angled<00:02:48.070> eyeliner<00:02:48.280> brush<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:51.190> this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
the angled eyeliner brush I like this

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.710 
the angled eyeliner brush I like this
brush<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.790> when<00:02:55.330> you're<00:02:55.480> doing<00:02:55.690> your

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
brush because when you're doing your

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.440 
brush because when you're doing your
eyeline<00:02:56.290> if<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.530> don't<00:02:56.680> want<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:57.040> like

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
eyeline if you don't want to be like

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.060 
eyeline if you don't want to be like
with<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.480> one<00:02:58.930> it's<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.590> doesn't<00:02:59.770> get

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
with this one it's just it doesn't get

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.250 
with this one it's just it doesn't get
right<00:03:00.340> because<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.120> keep<00:03:01.810> straight

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
right because you have to keep straight

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.310 
right because you have to keep straight
but<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.160> has<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> little<00:03:04.080> pointed<00:03:05.080> in

but this has like a little pointed in

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.200 
but this has like a little pointed in
that<00:03:05.680> makes<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.250> little<00:03:06.400> easy<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
that makes it a little easy this is the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.820 
that makes it a little easy this is the
eye<00:03:10.450> eye<00:03:10.930> shadow<00:03:11.620> see<00:03:11.980> brush<00:03:12.280> now<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.830> helped

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
often getting this for a long time

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.720 
often getting this for a long time
because<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.320> thought<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.250> will<00:03:18.490> be<00:03:18.520> no

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
because I thought that this will be no

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.010 
because I thought that this will be no
different<00:03:18.940> than<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> regular<00:03:19.660> eyeshadow
