00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.269
 so here is the machine the cargo ships that 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.779
 comes from the city hall of the company 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.090
 American 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:20.690
 it's a project and to develop the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.360
 mighty lavalin who actually turned out 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.190
 ian is so develop in 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.030
 different countries like France that are 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.320
 agree the principle 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.060
 for China is to print 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.650
 3d objects by wearing two matches 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.130
 friendly 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.460
 robert duverne 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.620
 and go 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 good two different plastics 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.900
 welcome 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.490
 finally my 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.740
 in fact it is in the form of a roll 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.780
 celebrated a crisis so it's exactly here 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.980
 we have a coil of postigo life so we 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.080
 will get in the head and we will 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.340
 to make him take the head now he's going 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.260
 allow layers to be deposited 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.260
 successively there are two plastics 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.660
 different there are cheaper and more 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 use the pl a way that makes it a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 pastic based starch starch 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 corn but it's a plastic that's going to be 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 brittle that is to say he will kill 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 that of exactly that one if by 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.679
 example we want to inflict 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.789
 as said aim a video in a term 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.250
 may break more easily 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.710
 Russian second plastic 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.060
 then it's the ds that makes it a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 petroleum-based plastic this 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.560
 family that has properties so 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.200
 different you to be a little son or 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.150
 little of the blow that ready to receive in fact 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.690
 zones and mechanics 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.290
 the encounter a little resistance 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.990
 different 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.180
 that's why you have to know that there are two 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.560
 machines the scene the girl called 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.390
 is coming late two models who knew 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.820
 not necessarily dubai above that 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.070
 is called 2x investigators who actually 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.909
 the head roja therefore to print 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.259
 two colors on the same object and the one 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.479
 it does not allow it to print from the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.799
 city ​​this time she close it but that's 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 very complicated because the decline 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.130
 there is a need for a tray and if that 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.390
 plateau there yes it needs it to be 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.769
 hot francs because here are not 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.630
 shocking of the decline will contract 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.230
 and there we will see a risk of having 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.230
 some problems 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170
 we 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.410
 m 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 on the other hand assange brewed him 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.810
 makes special properties it's 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.570
 in peace there precisely of the institute and 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.540
 that she seems but it was finally done 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.940
 model in a way by an artist who 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.500
 it has properties 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.960
 actually been sets etc we can 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 even in the return of recipes 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:13.870
 when she first wins 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.550
 savannahs there are also recently there are 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.570
 voice coils what came out in 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.670
 France so we can print courage 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.360
 it's about 60% you stick and well 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.060
 duty but to touch and smell that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.770
 without seeing it 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.700
 I love you 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.780
 a casting so the availability and price 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.120
 with 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.950
 so for this important France to 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.970
 gone through that she solves for a 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.280
 machine bought then in France 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.200
 it's going through a denecker partner 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.870
 boots or example we can have these 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.670
 cables these frames that guarantees 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.890
 the French carrier printers 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.209
 for a year for fans agree 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.090
 unlike baker botts and 30 days 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.530
 what is said also unable to send 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.260
 the printer in the usa a real internship and the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.190
 delay 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.450
 the same purpose analysis that initially what 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.569
 not me 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.599
 which can take a good and 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.100
 and that's the principle it's good 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.739
 thought that there are tools that are 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.049
 free logis 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.569
 nor by saint cloud that allow 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.740
 estimated for example that makes interesting 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.539
 which allows to estimate the time of a 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.650
 print okay so before you 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.389
 disassemble by a weird being 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.229
 ronaldinho 30 years old it can take you 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.639
 directly on the computer right click 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.639
 updated to analyze after noon 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:44.099
 example also ensures the sale of 

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:44.099
 finally popular 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.729
 the price then for a machine like 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.810
 that one is about 1800 euros 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.310
 who have tempered the axes the model that 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.449
 is above which contains two heads in 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.810
 fact that allows the cost of a price 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.840
 but they have two legal of the decline is 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.720
 of color was a bit more expensive near 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.290
 from 3500 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.310
 litigation and apple that's it for 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.800
 do we realize that we are approaching 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.460
 more and more of the particular at the level 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.200
 open design like that 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.400
 green for access to the room 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.510
 to success the second is here a 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.760
 closure because we fight and 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.610
 heated for it will have to see if 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.000
 the attraction of the bible agree but 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.000
 they are easy to remove
