you know this is our least expensive
carbon<00:02:01.460> frame<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.300> start<00:02:02.570> RS<00:02:02.930> frame

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
carbon frame so it's a start RS frame

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.020 
carbon frame so it's a start RS frame
the<00:02:03.920> only<00:02:04.100> thing<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.430> brake<00:02:04.610> bridge<00:02:04.820> is<00:02:05.000> a

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
the only thing is the brake bridge is a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.490 
the only thing is the brake bridge is a
little<00:02:05.240> bit<00:02:05.330> higher<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:05.930> have<00:02:06.050> nice<00:02:06.230> tire

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
little bit higher so we have nice tire

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.870 
little bit higher so we have nice tire
clearance<00:02:06.860> with<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.640> long<00:02:07.790> reach<00:02:08.000> brakes<00:02:09.880> you

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880
