00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.560
 With a feeling to every ball, hitting and defense have been working on the practice with all my strength 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.560
 Okiya agricultural high school 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:23.590
 Twenty-four members have grown up while working hard on one another 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:27.160
 Although it is a young team mainly based on 12th graders because there are few 3rd graders 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:35.110
 One goal is to set one goal 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.920
 Each one went always that let's you play with responsibility for 1 ball 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:44.120
 Because 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 Well I think that a good team was created in total to the same head of consciousness 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:54.490
 The third grader pulls the juniors with a play that is comfortable with a small number of people 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 It has also supported the manager player from him him also of Sanrense 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:02.960
 Since both players and managers have worked hard together so far, everyone is in baseball 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.930
 I want to win 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.390
 Focus on throwing practice to be Japan there are many 12th grade I is less Heike in practice 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.729
 We have to strengthen the defense 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.840
 The pitcher united three people around the back mountain which returned from injury in March this year 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.840
 I will head towards the other party 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.720
 The team in the spring of tournament 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:31.200
 The play which left a strong number with 30% is still strong 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.360
 Instead of aiming for a big one shot 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.070
 Members will aim to tie found in hit 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.480
 After all we shake the bat so that we shake well as it is the life of batting 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.560
 To go 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.150
 Today is support 0 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.920
 First of all, you have to fight the game in front of you 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.990
 One battle one battle 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:00.260
 Go anyway doing baseball you do not go and lose to win 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:06.320
 I think that it is not in it anymore and qualifying Kana cane 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.929
 I do not want to lose in the game I feel strongly that I want to play a game that will lead to tomorrow 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.069
 I will fight 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.069
 Because it was open
