transformation is lightly the the same

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.960 
transformation is lightly the the same
as<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.630> g1<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> now<00:02:36.100> we're<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.489> start

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
as the g1 and now we're going to start

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.430 
as the g1 and now we're going to start
transformation<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.840> first<00:02:38.140> thing<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.410> have

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
transformation the first thing we have

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.060 
transformation the first thing we have
to<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.980> split<00:02:39.160> here<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.330> tail<00:02:40.480> here

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
to do is to split here and the tail here

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.920 
to do is to split here and the tail here
into<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.040> then<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:46.330> have<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.690> bring

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
into like so and then I have to bring

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:58.860 
into like so and then I have to bring
this<00:02:47.140> whole<00:02:47.769> panel<00:02:49.410> pull<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:51.130> there<00:02:57.870> hi

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
this whole panel pull it down there hi

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.390 
this whole panel pull it down there hi
these<00:02:59.140> two<00:02:59.290> panels<00:02:59.620> going<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.130> become<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
these two panels going to become the
