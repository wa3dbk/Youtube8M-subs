00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
software rolling so he's even more up to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
software rolling so he's even more up to
date<00:01:49.290> than<00:01:49.590> teletraan<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.340> who<00:01:50.520> suffers

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
date than teletraan one who suffers

through<00:01:51.270> host<00:01:51.570> migration<00:01:51.840> sometimes<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
through host migration sometimes if you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.289 
through host migration sometimes if you
know<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.729> talking<00:01:54.060> about

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
using the orbital pistol as you see me

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.810 
using the orbital pistol as you see me
mark<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> Titan<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
mark that Titan there and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.970 
mark that Titan there and
getting<00:02:03.090> his<00:02:03.750> whirlwind<00:02:04.260> on<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.770> just

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
getting his whirlwind on and I just

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.850 
getting his whirlwind on and I just
threw<00:02:05.130> down<00:02:05.160> pussy<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> she<00:02:06.660> is<00:02:06.810> also<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.350> gal

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.859 
threw down pussy and she is also a gal
of<00:02:08.070> science<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> thought<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> would<00:02:09.509> use<00:02:09.660> her

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
of science so I thought I would use her

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.450 
of science so I thought I would use her

not the best scientist weapon anymore I
would<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.320> said<00:02:58.980> before<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.459> couple<00:02:59.640> patches

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120

much<00:04:58.950> especially<00:04:59.280> on<00:04:59.639> this<00:04:59.820> map<00:05:00.210> because<00:05:00.660> in

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
much especially on this map because in

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.469 
much especially on this map because in
this<00:05:01.200> map<00:05:01.440> when<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.680> do<00:05:01.860> get<00:05:02.280> chased<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.820> tend<00:05:03.389> to

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
this map when I do get chased I tend to

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.480 
this map when I do get chased I tend to
run<00:05:03.810> them<00:05:03.900> into<00:05:04.320> my<00:05:04.590> entire<00:05:04.830> team<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.400> then
