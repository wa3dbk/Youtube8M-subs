for<00:00:27.180> developers<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.980> give<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
for developers what they do is give you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.630 
for developers what they do is give you
a<00:00:29.699> small<00:00:30.570> provision<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.410> their<00:00:31.710> servers<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
applications distillation is the best

website to set up a site of your own if

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.190 
website to set up a site of your own if
you<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.219> lot<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.910> traffic<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:43.079> is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you have a lot of traffic this is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
you have a lot of traffic this is
because<00:00:43.500> VPS<00:00:44.160> hosting<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.730> much<00:00:45.000> faster<00:00:45.239> than

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because VPS hosting is much faster than

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.049 
because VPS hosting is much faster than
shared<00:00:46.320> hosting<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.039> particularly<00:00:47.789> because

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
shared hosting and particularly because

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.180 
shared hosting and particularly because
these<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.629> SSDs<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.620> reckoned<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> be

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
these are on SSDs it is reckoned to be

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.680 
these are on SSDs it is reckoned to be
about<00:00:50.550> three<00:00:50.820> times<00:00:51.000> quicker<00:00:51.300> than<00:00:51.480> shared

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
about three times quicker than shared

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.600 
about three times quicker than shared
hosting<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.739> each<00:00:52.890> plan<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.550> based<00:00:54.360> hourly<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
hosting so each plan is based hourly and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.220 
hosting so each plan is based hourly and
also<00:00:56.610> you'll<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.789> charged<00:00:57.180> per<00:00:57.390> hour<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
also you'll be charged per hour up to a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.819 
also you'll be charged per hour up to a
monthly<00:00:58.680> cap<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.210> example<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.649> switch

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
monthly cap so for example if we switch

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.000 
monthly cap so for example if we switch
to<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> hourly<00:01:02.309> mode<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to the hourly mode we can see that it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.380 
to the hourly mode we can see that it
costs<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.909> point<00:01:06.210> naught<00:01:06.420> naught<00:01:06.630> 7<00:01:07.080> per<00:01:08.070> hour

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
costs not point naught naught 7 per hour

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.390 
costs not point naught naught 7 per hour
to<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.250> basic<00:01:11.750> SSD<00:01:12.750> VPS<00:01:13.140> set<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
to have a basic SSD VPS set up and that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
to have a basic SSD VPS set up and that
will<00:01:14.490> give<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.790> 512<00:01:15.390> Meg<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> memory<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:17.040> core

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
will give you 512 Meg of memory one core

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
will give you 512 Meg of memory one core
CPU<00:01:17.850> 20<00:01:18.840> gig<00:01:18.960> SSD<00:01:19.110> disk<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> terabyte

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
CPU 20 gig SSD disk and a terabyte

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.880 
CPU 20 gig SSD disk and a terabyte
transfer<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.990> most<00:01:22.080> people<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.650> more

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
transfer which for most people is more

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
transfer which for most people is more
than<00:01:23.009> enough<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.850> costs<00:01:24.360> five<00:01:24.930> dollars<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
than enough that costs five dollars a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.010 
than enough that costs five dollars a
month<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> way<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> obviously<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
month and the way that obviously it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.260 
month and the way that obviously it
works<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.520> charge<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.909> per<00:01:30.119> hour

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
works is that they charge you per hour

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
works is that they charge you per hour
up<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.470> monthly<00:01:31.680> cap<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.430> delete

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
up to a monthly cap so if you delete

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.980 
up to a monthly cap so if you delete
your<00:01:34.040> VPS<00:01:35.040> after<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.850> week<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.689> only<00:01:36.720> be

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
your VPS after a week you only be

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
your VPS after a week you only be
charged<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> amount<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.189> hours<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
charged for the amount of hours that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.170 
charged for the amount of hours that
you've<00:01:38.640> used<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you've used it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
you've used it
however<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.079> other<00:01:40.290> plans<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.770> well

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
transfer also your additional transfer

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.339 
transfer also your additional transfer
is<00:02:18.200> only<00:02:18.890> 2<00:02:19.340> cents<00:02:19.730> per<00:02:19.760> gigabyte<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:21.110> if<00:02:21.230> you

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
is only 2 cents per gigabyte so if you

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.790 
is only 2 cents per gigabyte so if you
go<00:02:21.500> over<00:02:21.700> by<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:23.000> few<00:02:23.330> gigabytes<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:24.680> only

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
go over by a few gigabytes that's only

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.710 
go over by a few gigabytes that's only
going<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.040> cost<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.430> few<00:02:25.610> more<00:02:25.700> cents<00:02:26.000> there

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
going to cost you a few more cents there

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
going to cost you a few more cents there
are<00:02:26.810> several<00:02:26.959> other<00:02:27.200> features<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:27.860> well<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
are several other features as well and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.930 
are several other features as well and
to<00:02:28.849> do<00:02:28.970> with<00:02:29.090> distillation<00:02:29.510> for<00:02:30.440> example<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
to do with distillation for example you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.030 
to do with distillation for example you

which<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.760> pretty<00:02:34.910> quick<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:36.290> means<00:02:36.560> that

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
which is pretty quick that means that

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.460 
which is pretty quick that means that

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
that you use service like this because

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.860 
that you use service like this because
it<00:03:16.190> can<00:03:16.310> serve<00:03:16.519> webpages<00:03:16.940> quicker<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.540> they

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
it can serve webpages quicker and they

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.370 
it can serve webpages quicker and they
also<00:03:17.989> run<00:03:18.320> their<00:03:18.650> servers<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.280> hexa<00:03:20.180> core

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
also run their servers on hexa core

we also offer shared private networking
so<00:03:27.109> one<00:03:27.799> droplet<00:03:28.069> is<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.549> virtual<00:03:29.299> machine<00:03:29.420> one

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
so one droplet is a virtual machine one

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.259 
so one droplet is a virtual machine one
droplet<00:03:30.530> can<00:03:30.829> talk<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.160> another<00:03:31.220> droplet<00:03:31.730> so

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
droplet can talk to another droplet so

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.509 
droplet can talk to another droplet so
that's<00:03:32.630> within<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.200> data<00:03:33.380> center<00:03:33.470> your<00:03:34.250> two

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
that's within the data center your two

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.250 
that's within the data center your two
droplets<00:03:34.819> can<00:03:35.180> talk<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.840> each<00:03:35.900> other<00:03:36.109> and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
droplets can talk to each other and

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.289 
droplets can talk to each other and
communicate<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.950> also<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.400> means<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.970> any

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
communicate and also that means that any

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.199 
communicate and also that means that any
data<00:03:38.840> transferred<00:03:39.410> do<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:40.190> get<00:03:40.730> counted<00:03:41.120> in

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
data transferred do not get counted in

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.180 
data transferred do not get counted in
the<00:03:41.420> transfer<00:03:41.959> costs<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.829> now<00:03:42.950> I'm<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.130> to

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
the transfer costs so now I'm going to
