00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.589
 I announced in the video I have 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.809
 released a couple of days ago from 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 title matches classified divisions e 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.469

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.619
 season of ranked matches 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.140

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060

 all the various regulations and so on 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 that I had explained in this video 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.900
 so if you missed it, go to it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.849
 see then for all the restrictions e 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 regulations in detail there is precisely the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.079
 community the summer games forum 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.890
 for all the information but let's go to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.530
 make us a match in the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 ranking in the ranked match 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 season 1 win matches against i 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.530
 top level players for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 advance in divisions and obtain 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 exclusive content by playing with rules 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.510
 and modes and sports then we go 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.600
 let's see if some find me right away 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.730
 nice match 50 potential matches 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.680
 found in the operating settings 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.020
 here we can go and see how we are 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 positioned in classic and is of bronze and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.799
 silver then bronze right from the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.840
 lower part of the ranking and then 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.850
 we have cash in hand but all this if 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.560
 you missed it I remind you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 this video I released a couple 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 days ago so I go and see 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 for all various information while from 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 today we are starting to shoot this 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.960
 season 1 will obviously try to do 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 a few games will be a bit difficult for 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.400
 me to be able to play often 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 in the match ranking because they are 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 all modalities where I or rather the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 vast majority of the methods 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.630
 where in a game because I'm used to it 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 more on deathmatch stuff then 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 mainly confirmed killing 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.200
 so if you succeed in a search and destroy 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.450
 I no longer have the hand of the past but 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.329
 why should I kind of take the hand e 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.040
 away saying here immediately against a clan e 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.770
 so I see it really very badly 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.200
 we will be paved clb clb would be for 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.930
 now I don't like it as a mode a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.020
 capture the flag or capture the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.210
 pig flag dog catches the flag 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.310
 I don't tell you cretinate but it seems to me there 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.140
 I made a call on call of duty 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.360
 then one advanced air warfare 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.230
 I guess we are so zero points 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.180
 guys lose it seems to me that the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 defeat seems to me around for sure 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.830
 something like this then worse than 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.950
 so he couldn't go here then 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.140
 makes me take anything and I would say of 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.450
 put this back here let's go to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.850
 turn off the voices because there is love there 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.080
 static casino so I would go to 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.960
 immediately take the beautiful thing 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 I don't understand if all of them are one 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.760
 immediately outside, what a show 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.970
 attention or not killed great 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.470

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.260
 go go go go go go let's go let's go 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.060
 let's go there where to take where the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.140
 I have to bring it to my point of rebirth 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.390
 mica cacchio I know you bring it here 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.760
 perfect catch to make the catch 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.430
 flag capture we already send one to 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.709
 zero for us boys aged and somewhat by a 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.260
 let's go and get it let's go to 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.870
 take note I must be able to understand 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 guys how can I not use 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.330
 because you see that there is something in 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.300
 this class is not good for the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.890
 my mode for this mode then 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.740
 I would say to go and collect the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.010
 flag and if someone helps me guys 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.680
 let's go bring somebody up 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:53.280
 that put behind flag holder killed 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:56.620
 up up up up up run run run run 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.720
 perfect 2 to 0 for us guys i'm 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.820
 playing alone in a mode where 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.740
 I've never played it here 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:09.520
 a fourth level good with the head f5 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.720
 that we have taken charge and we go 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.860
 caution 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:21.820
 an enemy here come here i'm not dead 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.970

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.090
 let's all go with me all like 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.310
 no flag bearer that only I beat 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.620
 but we are 3 to 0 against a clan 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.240
 I honestly don't mind this 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.490
 let's go and collect the flag 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.850
 no kids here are going to do 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.340
 point is take it priest please 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.200
 cacchio fa I take it for myself less than me 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870
 I take me on someone who comes to me 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.570
 defend if we go up on two if here 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.990
 above protect me good you go inside me 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.400
 but off of fear wait for that 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.680
 control it seems to me we can do 40 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.350
 we can at 40 we are at 40 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:09.250

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:15.430
 no flag kids know something 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:18.730
 that should be nothing but shit and numbered sea 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.460
 seen as excusing rock wallets 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.169
 stung myself where three is taken 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.960
 shit, but it's not true you don't 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.450
 allowed to enter incredible 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.180
 unbelievable but true guys I don't 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.740
 allowed to 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.770
 the one where you come here with all that 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.600
 the kf 5 which has an excellent weapon but 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.990
 honestly I have it with the 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.000
 standard configuration we go 5 to 0 ma 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.300
 given something to them they are facts ha 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.169
 since I saw it well I must have seen it 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.750
 be able to understand which women are a 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.870
 see the rules to be able to play 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.110
 with the sm 1 then the weapon which 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:07.970
 I think it's perfect for playing 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:11.039
 enemy withdrawal methods then boys 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.440

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.470
 well ranked matches like this 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.440
