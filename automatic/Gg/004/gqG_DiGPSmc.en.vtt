00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.600
 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.180
 will consider 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.340
 the next issue of the review of inputs and today 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.210
 we will talk about the new legs and more precisely 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.309
 turtles 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.930
 The feature of these turtles is 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.240
 tom what they attract for example 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.810
 wheat is just like a pig or 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.270
 any 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.930
 a sheep and let's see if we 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.000
 this turtle is now tighten the sea on 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.980
 river which is generally water, tighten the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.780
 speak right away this turtle will 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.000
 be out endless time then 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.250
 there is see the moment she is in the water and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.260
 she won't choke for a long time 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.270
 more precisely, as I have said, it will never be 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.880
 gasp and I find it very very 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.520
 plus for yes very cool well basically 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.829
 and realistic turtle probably introductory 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.390
 and what's next next is that 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.489
 if we call back now 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.070
 the turtle is called upon as i said 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.440
 probably wheat we need only 2 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.410
 turtles and if we give them now 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.870
 wheat that's what will happen 1 2 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.149
 they will multiply in the future 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.250
 get a little bug of course 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.580
 she looks like a simple big like 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.470
 parents but still really it 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.110
 little turtle and of course discern 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.030
 them very hard okay following what he 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.940
 the next is what if we are now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.679
 take the workbench take the workbench and kill 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.140
 which is not a turtle like this 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.720
 tortoise beat she kills with three hits 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.849
 a diamond sword drops its shell 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 what can we make of armor armor 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.229
 of course because it 's the same armor 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 protects a very strong course in 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.940
 minecraft it protects not so tightly 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.030
 like this shell and protects a little bit 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.490
 better than leather armor and a little bit 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.750
 smaller than iron armor in general 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.360
 somewhere between iron and leather armor 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.429
 that 's the kind of craft you already see on 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.890
 my screens and now i will show how it is 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.440
 It looks at itself that is on our style 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.050
 but although I carry in of course but oh well and 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.690
 Now we turn off the creative q and here's how 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.119
 It looks like a complete set, that is, on me 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.580
 wearing cool enough looks 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.220
 Of course all sorts of tools to do 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.590
 this turtle armor cannot 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.629
 and very sad of course but actually 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.560
 we had today such a mod and if 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.290
 did you like that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.410
 and get off at the start of the channel, I do not have the huskies 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.520
 knocked out and call friends little we all 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.520
 good luck everyone bye
