00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
do this to any building but if it hasn't

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
do this to any building but if it hasn't
got<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.550> interior<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.629> an<00:01:00.750> actual<00:01:00.899> thing

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.929 
downstairs area to the fiv building you
might<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:34.770> inside<00:01:35.700> there

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
might go to do that because inside there
