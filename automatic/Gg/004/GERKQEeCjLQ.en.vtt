and eye on all these areas make sure no
the<00:01:03.539> rivets<00:01:03.840> either<00:01:04.110> follow<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.240> maybe<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.330> miss

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the rivets either follow or maybe I miss

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.179 
the rivets either follow or maybe I miss
one<00:01:06.750> who<00:01:06.900> knows<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.860> uh<00:01:07.939> here's<00:01:08.939> know

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
one who knows but uh here's know

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.260 
one who knows but uh here's know
starting<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> take<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> cleat<00:01:11.700> goes<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
starting to take the cleat goes out and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
starting to take the cleat goes out and
also<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.600> realize<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.200> two<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> these

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
also I realize there are two of these

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.130 
also I realize there are two of these
parts<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.460> almost<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.909> exact<00:01:15.210> same<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
parts that are almost the exact same so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
parts that are almost the exact same so
I'm<00:01:16.259> gonna<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.560> ahead<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.159> mark<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.670> one

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I'm gonna go ahead and I mark this one

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.289 
I'm gonna go ahead and I mark this one
right<00:01:18.090> top<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.810> marking<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> other<00:01:19.560> one

right top and I'm marking the other one

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.300 
right top and I'm marking the other one
left<00:01:21.299> top<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.530> too<00:01:22.680> confused<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
left top so I don't get too confused and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.100 
left top so I don't get too confused and
I<00:01:23.369> possibly<00:01:23.790> swap<00:01:24.210> them<00:01:24.479> while<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.869> both

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
I possibly swap them while I have both

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.179 
I possibly swap them while I have both
of<00:01:25.140> them<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.500> working<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> next<00:01:26.250> bits

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
of them off working in the next bits

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.370 
of them off working in the next bits
okay<00:01:29.189> after<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.820> trouble<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> tips

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
okay after some trouble I got the tips

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.219 
okay after some trouble I got the tips
off<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.329> metal<00:01:33.329> areas<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:33.990> here

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
off these little metal areas right here

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
off these little metal areas right here
act<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.920> knives<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.460> dig<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
act as little knives that dig into the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.219 
act as little knives that dig into the
fiberglass<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.570> don't<00:01:36.720> allow<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> pull

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
fiberglass and don't allow you to pull

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.520 
fiberglass and don't allow you to pull
it<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> need<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> shave<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:39.930> down<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it out so I need to shave them down the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.600 
it out so I need to shave them down the
next<00:01:40.770> step<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.189> both<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:41.820> sides<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
next step on both these sides is to

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.359 
next step on both these sides is to
drill<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:45.840> six<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.619> these<00:01:49.189> rivets<00:01:50.189> right

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
drill out all six of these rivets right

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
drill out all six of these rivets right
here<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> need<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.409> piece

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
here and then I need to take this piece

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.969 
here and then I need to take this piece
out<00:01:52.829> dimple<00:01:53.759> die<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.119> top<00:01:54.390> piece<00:01:54.750> I'll

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
out dimple die this top piece I'll

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.410 
out dimple die this top piece I'll
countersink<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> holes<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> fiberglass

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
countersink the holes in the fiberglass

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.580 
countersink the holes in the fiberglass
and<00:01:57.899> then<00:01:58.649> I'll<00:01:58.860> leave<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.250> flat<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.590> once

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and then I'll leave these flat and once

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
and then I'll leave these flat and once
I<00:02:01.710> pull<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.100> part<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I pull this part out then I can go and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.639 
I pull this part out then I can go and
attach<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.590> rear<00:02:04.799> part<00:02:06.020> relatively<00:02:07.020> simply

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
attach the rear part relatively simply

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.029 
attach the rear part relatively simply
but<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.750> yeah<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.929> should<00:02:10.110> work<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> there

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
but but yeah it should work for it there

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.600 
but but yeah it should work for it there
all<00:02:11.340> right

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
all right

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.710 
all right
for<00:02:14.500> drilling<00:02:15.500> out<00:02:15.739> these<00:02:16.430> cleat<00:02:16.730> she's<00:02:17.330> mean

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
for drilling out these cleat she's mean

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.860 
for drilling out these cleat she's mean
these<00:02:18.049> rivets<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.590> first<00:02:18.950> put<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.159> punch<00:02:19.870> into

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
these rivets I first put a punch into

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.009 
these rivets I first put a punch into
the<00:02:21.110> hole<00:02:21.409> and<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:22.519> use<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> hammer<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.360> flatten

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
the hole and I use a hammer to flatten

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.020 
the hole and I use a hammer to flatten
down<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.349> bar<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.890> shoot<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.549> out<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.819> back

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
down the bar and shoot it out the back

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.059 
down the bar and shoot it out the back
that<00:02:26.360> was<00:02:26.510> used<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.930> squish<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.500> rip<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.739> up<00:02:27.830> and

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
that was used to squish to rip it up and

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.690 
that was used to squish to rip it up and
then<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:28.879> took<00:02:29.000> my<00:02:29.239> drill<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.489> same

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
then I took my drill this is the same

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.850 
then I took my drill this is the same
size<00:02:31.879> drill<00:02:32.269> as<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.540> actual<00:02:32.780> rivet<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.349> I

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
size drill as the actual rivet and I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.680 
size drill as the actual rivet and I
used<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> head<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.879> a<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:37.549> centering<00:02:38.450> device

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
used the head as a as a centering device

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.210 
used the head as a as a centering device
and<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:38.959> started<00:02:39.319> slowly<00:02:39.590> drilling<00:02:40.040> and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
and just started slowly drilling and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.550 
and just started slowly drilling and
what<00:02:40.700> popped<00:02:41.030> out<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:41.299> do<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.170> with<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.379> top

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
what popped out I do this with the top

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.289 
what popped out I do this with the top
one<00:02:42.799> is<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.459> head<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.959> rivet<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.940> was

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
one is the head of the rivet that was

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.330 
one is the head of the rivet that was
its<00:02:47.540> directly<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.110> middle<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:49.190> got

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
its directly in the middle of and I got

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.949 
its directly in the middle of and I got
it<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.489> cleanly<00:02:49.879> without<00:02:50.209> going<00:02:50.599> any<00:02:50.720> further

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
it out cleanly without going any further

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.119 
it out cleanly without going any further
so<00:02:51.319> worked<00:02:51.500> out<00:02:51.590> pretty<00:02:51.680> well<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:53.890> got<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:54.980> open

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
so worked out pretty well I got it open

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.309 
so worked out pretty well I got it open
after<00:02:55.400> getting<00:02:55.640> lost<00:02:55.790> rivets<00:02:56.239> out<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
after getting lost rivets out it's a

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.160 
after getting lost rivets out it's a
mess<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.400> lot<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.239> different<00:02:59.540> little<00:02:59.629> shards

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
mess a lot of different little shards

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.210 
mess a lot of different little shards
everywhere<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.530> we<00:03:00.620> go<00:03:00.739> ahead<00:03:00.859> and<00:03:00.950> take<00:03:01.190> a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
everywhere and we go ahead and take a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.770 
everywhere and we go ahead and take a
rag<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.489> stick<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.879> way<00:03:02.090> up<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.359> there<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.599> try

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
rag and stick it way up in there and try

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.539

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
and pull the other little bits out and

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.729 
and pull the other little bits out and
we<00:03:04.819> touch<00:03:05.209> up<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> paint<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.290> these<00:03:06.470> because

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
we touch up the paint on these because

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.890 
we touch up the paint on these because
they<00:03:06.920> almost<00:03:07.519> sealed<00:03:07.970> together<00:03:08.239> when<00:03:08.569> i<00:03:08.660> crack

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
they almost sealed together when i crack

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.990 
they almost sealed together when i crack
them<00:03:09.109> apart<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.530> kind<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.769> ripped<00:03:10.370> them<00:03:10.519> from

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
them apart it kind of ripped them from

and line it up I couldn't get the piece
in<00:03:55.579> earlier<00:03:55.879> because<00:03:56.150> these<00:03:56.269> three<00:03:56.660> rivets<00:03:56.959> in

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169
