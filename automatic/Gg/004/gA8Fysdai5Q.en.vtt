at first until you get a feel for how

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870 
at first until you get a feel for how
much<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:36.030> your<00:01:36.600> skin<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.170> take<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:38.369> areas

like<00:01:38.909> under<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> chin<00:01:39.780> where<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.350> likely

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
like under the chin where you are likely

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.620 
like under the chin where you are likely
to<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.040> white<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> blackheads<00:01:41.970> gently

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
to have white and blackheads gently

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.330 
to have white and blackheads gently
place<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:42.960> tongue<00:01:43.439> under<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> skin<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
place your tongue under the skin to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.090 
place your tongue under the skin to
stretch<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.390> will<00:01:45.659> force<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> sebum<00:01:46.619> out

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
stretch it this will force the sebum out

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
stretch it this will force the sebum out
to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> surface<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.149> crystals<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.990> buff

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to the surface so the crystals can buff

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.039
