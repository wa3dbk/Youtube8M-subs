00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.110 
that off once you get it off
take<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.510> snap<00:02:12.840> out<00:02:13.190> by<00:02:14.190> twisting<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
take this snap out by twisting it to the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.930 
take this snap out by twisting it to the
left<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.620> put<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:16.920> back<00:02:17.099> into

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
left and then you can put it back into

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.180 
left and then you can put it back into
the<00:02:18.510> molding<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.500> then<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.799> whole<00:02:19.950> thing

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the molding and then the whole thing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.449 
the molding and then the whole thing
will<00:02:20.310> snap<00:02:20.580> right<00:02:20.610> back<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:24.230> alright<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> once

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
will snap right back in alright so once

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.729 
will snap right back in alright so once
we've<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:27.030> headlight<00:02:27.540> down<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> where

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
we've got that headlight down to where

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.380 
we've got that headlight down to where
we<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.280> elbows<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.150> get

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
we can get to the elbows like so you get

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.789 
we can get to the elbows like so you get
to<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.599> bolt<00:02:30.870> right<00:02:30.989> here<00:02:31.110> it's<00:02:31.440> buried<00:02:31.709> up

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
to this bolt right here it's buried up

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.970 
to this bolt right here it's buried up
in<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.130> hole<00:02:32.370> take<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.480> out<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.799> the

in this hole take that out now on the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.059 
in this hole take that out now on the
end<00:02:35.540> you'll<00:02:36.540> see<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.709> get<00:02:37.799> where<00:02:38.010> you

don't know if I'm gonna need to or not

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.610 
don't know if I'm gonna need to or not
but<00:03:36.419> I'll<00:03:36.540> find<00:03:36.780> out<00:03:36.989> once<00:03:37.200> they're<00:03:37.380> getting

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
but I'll find out once they're getting

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.670 
but I'll find out once they're getting
on<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.489> anyway<00:03:39.079> fairly<00:03:40.079> simple<00:03:40.549> not<00:03:41.549> too<00:03:41.910> bad

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
on but anyway fairly simple not too bad

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.550 
on but anyway fairly simple not too bad
you<00:03:43.680> probably<00:03:44.810> really<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.930> problem<00:03:46.200> is

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you probably really the problem is

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.000 
you probably really the problem is
taking<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:49.109> only<00:03:49.319> really<00:03:49.560> problem

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
taking the this the only really problem

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.559 
taking the this the only really problem
is<00:03:50.099> taking<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.489> bottom<00:03:50.880> piece<00:03:51.060> off<00:03:51.299> right

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
is taking this bottom piece off right

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.050 
is taking this bottom piece off right
here<00:03:51.870> because<00:03:52.799> once<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.220> take<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.609> bolt<00:03:53.880> out

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
here because once you take this bolt out

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.839 
here because once you take this bolt out
here<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.500> kind<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.889> pull<00:03:56.459> out<00:03:56.669> and

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
here you have to kind of pull out and

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.490 
here you have to kind of pull out and
prise<00:03:57.120> well<00:03:57.359> pretty<00:03:57.569> hard<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.930> get<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.230> snap

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
prise well pretty hard to get to snap

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.949 
prise well pretty hard to get to snap
and<00:03:58.940> neither<00:03:59.940> one<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.359> clips<00:04:00.569> broke<00:04:00.930> oh

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
and neither one of the clips broke oh

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.229 
and neither one of the clips broke oh
man<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.829> hopefully<00:04:02.130> yours<00:04:02.519> won't<00:04:02.700> either

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
man so hopefully yours won't either

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.500 
man so hopefully yours won't either
but<00:04:03.840> anyway<00:04:04.260> as<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.519> can<00:04:05.700> see<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.120> revolt

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
but anyway as you can see the revolt

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.229 
but anyway as you can see the revolt
results<00:04:07.170> are<00:04:07.379> dramatic<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.849> difference

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
results are dramatic the difference

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.819 
results are dramatic the difference
between<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.510> new<00:04:09.750> headlight<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.260> old<00:04:10.439> one<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
between a new headlight and old one and

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:11.210 
between a new headlight and old one and
they

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
they

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.460 
they
