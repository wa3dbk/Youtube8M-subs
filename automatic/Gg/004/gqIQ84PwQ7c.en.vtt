 Juan 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.570
 How do you get to the city? 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.120
 recently new stations of the 4-yellow subway line were inaugurated in 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 são paulo as the station butantã a paulistana 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.600
 and technological resources and try not seen in the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.630
 other lines they bring discussion of how much a transport structure 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.739
 influence on the daily lives of thousands of people who interact with the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.820
 subway 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.350
 the complete name of the bitch norberto dos santos my name is dr 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 in the confrontation with November 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.460
 evan and coordinator of the landscaping projects part 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.150
 and organization of the subway 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.180
 in a chat with our team 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.910
 he told how the resources of this yellow line became an example for the 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.420
 entities and for the new stations that will be built in the city I think 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.090
 I am saying that it was designed to facilitate the flow of people and these 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.750
 spaces are thought for a few 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 they not only thought space to the slopes with the people remain 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.600
 stations with platform doors for safe access to the trails 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.460
 intelligent and cross-built escalators for 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880
 avoid crowding of people 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.869
 Tactile floor elevators also educate co-defendants larger than 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.250
 so that everyone has full autonomy and because so much space 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.440
 of circulation 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.280
 the public spaces are paulo 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.650
 they are very interesting marriage between engineering efe 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.220
 this made it easier to stabilize the vessel is a construction them 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.050
 also establishes a beautiful relationship 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.880
 people have to be buried 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.750
 in these spaces are perceived a broader more open form 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 same space being contained 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.990
 big buildings like he took me 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.070
 we need specific coatings to withstand the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.300
 people tablets on the pilasters the synopsis on the facade in apparent concrete 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.500
 They guarantee greater durability. Glasses make it easier to clean 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.270
 curves that came out of space also intends to protect the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.539
 public transportation 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.549
 how the city 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.330
 while talking about things 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.049
 similarities 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.839
 well this is a situation we put innovation from china 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.259
 line 4 now our functions 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.259
 and reinforces the main elements that builds nothing 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.199
 how the new subway stations ensured the natural resources 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.309
 we in the electoral registries part of the concept of use 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.829
 the investigation 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.829
 in the end taking these donations to the palace 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.320
 it does not matter if a station has a good structure 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.329
 the population 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.659
 the space 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.239
 it has to have a quality of yielding 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.729
 our journey a little 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:10.469
 it is a question of giving a quality space so that people perceive the 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.199
 that is being done with quality for this also the death of these people 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.069
 partial and strong kick architecture
