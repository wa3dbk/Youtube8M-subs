pages<00:03:08.570> information<00:03:09.020> than<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.260> YouTube<00:03:09.920> maybe

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
pages information than on YouTube maybe

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.590 
pages information than on YouTube maybe
a<00:03:10.340> web<00:03:10.490> page<00:03:10.640> it'll<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:11.030> these<00:03:11.180> circuit

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
a web page it'll have these circuit

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.270 
a web page it'll have these circuit
diagram<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.290> we'll<00:03:12.440> have<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> printed

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
diagram and we'll have the printed

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.330 
diagram and we'll have the printed
circuit<00:03:13.370> board<00:03:13.670> lay<00:03:13.880> up<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.290> constructional

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
circuit board lay up the constructional

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.140 
circuit board lay up the constructional
step-by-step<00:03:16.340> put<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.610> together<00:03:16.730> but<00:03:17.000> I'll<00:03:17.060> do

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
step-by-step put it together but I'll do

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.090 
step-by-step put it together but I'll do
the<00:03:17.210> video<00:03:17.360> as<00:03:17.540> well<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.740> just<00:03:18.860> wanted<00:03:19.040> to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
the video as well but I just wanted to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.530 
the video as well but I just wanted to
make<00:03:19.220> sure<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.460> everything<00:03:19.640> was<00:03:19.970> finalized

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
make sure that everything was finalized

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.940 
make sure that everything was finalized
before<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.960> did<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.350> because<00:03:21.440> no<00:03:21.680> good<00:03:21.800> making

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
before I did that because no good making

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.350 
before I did that because no good making
changes<00:03:22.370> once<00:03:22.550> everyone's<00:03:23.030> gone<00:03:23.150> out<00:03:23.300> and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
changes once everyone's gone out and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.760 
changes once everyone's gone out and
bought<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.600> bits<00:03:23.750> because<00:03:24.230> they<00:03:24.500> be<00:03:24.710> all

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
bought the bits because they be all

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.040 
bought the bits because they be all
annoy<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.520> meet<00:03:25.640> him<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.120> coming<00:03:26.510> up<00:03:26.660> by<00:03:26.990> the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
annoy to meet him so coming up by the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.870 
annoy to meet him so coming up by the
end<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.380> week<00:03:27.470> we'll<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.160> all<00:03:28.370> so

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
end of the week we'll have all so

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.040 
end of the week we'll have all so
hopefully<00:03:29.030> by<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.300> end<00:03:29.360> of<00:03:29.480> week<00:03:29.540> we'll<00:03:29.900> have

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
hopefully by the end of week we'll have

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.080 
hopefully by the end of week we'll have
the<00:03:30.200> fpv<00:03:30.860> backpack<00:03:31.220> project<00:03:31.580> least<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.910> first

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
the fpv backpack project least the first

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.520 
the fpv backpack project least the first
phase<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:32.930> go<00:03:33.020> in<00:03:33.110> all<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.440> bits

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
phase of it you can go in all your bits

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.680 
phase of it you can go in all your bits
and<00:03:33.710> pieces<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.360> can<00:03:35.480> put<00:03:35.600> them

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
and pieces and then you can put them

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.370 
and pieces and then you can put them
together<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:35.960> see<00:03:36.260> how<00:03:36.710> it<00:03:36.770> goes<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:39.110> then<00:03:39.290> be

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
together and see how it goes and then be

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.140 
together and see how it goes and then be
two<00:03:39.560> versions<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.160> fpv<00:03:40.700> backpack<00:03:41.000> because

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
two versions of the fpv backpack because

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.120 
two versions of the fpv backpack because
one<00:03:41.750> version<00:03:42.080> will<00:03:42.230> have<00:03:42.260> surface<00:03:42.920> mount

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
one version will have surface mount

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.430 
one version will have surface mount
components<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.880> it's<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> little<00:03:45.020> bit<00:03:45.140> hard<00:03:45.320> as

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
components and it's a little bit hard as

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.200 
components and it's a little bit hard as
a<00:03:45.530> soldier<00:03:45.860> little<00:03:46.100> bit<00:03:46.190> trickier<00:03:46.550> so<00:03:46.940> I'm

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
a soldier little bit trickier so I'm

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.270 
a soldier little bit trickier so I'm
going<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.810> do<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:48.110> version<00:03:48.350> for<00:03:48.980> those<00:03:49.100> who

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
going to do that version for those who

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.680 
going to do that version for those who
are<00:03:49.400> confident<00:03:49.940> with<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.180> soaring<00:03:50.510> I'm<00:03:50.600> not

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
are confident with the soaring I'm not

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.300 
are confident with the soaring I'm not
the<00:03:50.780> smallest<00:03:51.020> lightest<00:03:51.680> possible<00:03:51.860> version

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
the smallest lightest possible version

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.680 
the smallest lightest possible version
but<00:03:52.700> I'm<00:03:52.820> going<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.090> do<00:03:53.270> what<00:03:53.450> they<00:03:53.510> call<00:03:53.660> a

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
but I'm going to do what they call a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.720 
but I'm going to do what they call a
through-hole<00:03:54.350> version<00:03:55.010> as<00:03:55.160> well<00:03:55.220> which<00:03:55.700> is

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
through-hole version as well which is

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.190 
through-hole version as well which is
much<00:03:56.090> like<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.390> old<00:03:56.510> traditional<00:03:56.870> into<00:03:57.080> ever

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
much like the old traditional into ever

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.510 
much like the old traditional into ever
the<00:03:57.500> bigger<00:03:57.710> resistors<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.250> push<00:03:58.430> them

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
the bigger resistors you push them

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.560 
the bigger resistors you push them
through<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.790> board<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.060> solder<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.420> wires

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
through the board and solder the wires

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.540 
through the board and solder the wires
on<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.780> deck<00:03:59.930> that'll<00:04:00.650> be<00:04:00.770> for<00:04:01.250> those<00:04:01.340> who

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
on the deck that'll be for those who

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.850 
on the deck that'll be for those who
don't<00:04:02.090> want<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.480> mess<00:04:02.930> around<00:04:03.080> with<00:04:03.260> tiny<00:04:03.560> tiny

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
don't want to mess around with tiny tiny

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.320 
don't want to mess around with tiny tiny
little<00:04:04.070> surface<00:04:04.490> mount<00:04:04.700> components<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:05.240> will

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
little surface mount components it will

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.760 
little surface mount components it will
be<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.450> little<00:04:05.570> bit<00:04:05.690> bigger<00:04:05.990> it<00:04:06.440> will<00:04:06.590> be<00:04:06.740> a

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
be a little bit bigger it will be a

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.440 
be a little bit bigger it will be a
little<00:04:06.920> bit<00:04:07.070> heavier<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:07.490> not<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.210> much<00:04:08.390> that

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
little bit heavier but not so much that

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.810 
little bit heavier but not so much that
you'd<00:04:08.720> really<00:04:08.960> notice<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:09.440> one<00:04:10.100> version<00:04:10.580> for

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
you'd really notice so one version for

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.840 
you'd really notice so one version for
each<00:04:11.000> type<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.840> user<00:04:12.740> depending<00:04:13.100> on<00:04:13.370> how<00:04:13.640> good

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
each type of user depending on how good

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.810 
each type of user depending on how good
your<00:04:14.000> soldering<00:04:14.450> skills<00:04:14.750> are<00:04:15.489> what<00:04:16.489> else<00:04:16.670> have

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
your soldering skills are what else have

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.700 
your soldering skills are what else have
a<00:04:16.880> good<00:04:17.120> here<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.780> also<00:04:18.140> coming<00:04:18.440> up<00:04:18.590> very

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
a good here is also coming up very

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.229 
a good here is also coming up very
shortly<00:04:18.799> I've<00:04:19.250> been<00:04:19.370> working<00:04:19.640> on<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.850> four

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
shortly I've been working on the four

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.240 
shortly I've been working on the four
channels<00:04:20.720> which<00:04:21.109> can<00:04:21.410> also<00:04:21.530> be<00:04:21.620> an<00:04:21.770> 8-channel

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
channels which can also be an 8-channel

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.730 
channels which can also be an 8-channel
diversity<00:04:22.880> receiver<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.530> whole<00:04:24.710> thing

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
diversity receiver and the whole thing

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.470 
diversity receiver and the whole thing
that<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.520> diversity<00:04:25.760> controller<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.420> the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
that is the diversity controller and the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.200 
that is the diversity controller and the
four<00:04:26.750> receivers<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.470> 5.8<00:04:28.280> gigahertz<00:04:28.550> probably

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
four receivers on 5.8 gigahertz probably

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.270 
four receivers on 5.8 gigahertz probably
come<00:04:29.330> in<00:04:29.450> at<00:04:29.540> under<00:04:29.690> 100<00:04:30.290> US<00:04:30.590> dollar<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.130> it's

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
come in at under 100 US dollar so it's

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.820 
come in at under 100 US dollar so it's
quite<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.520> good<00:04:31.760> point<00:04:32.540> significant<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.740> in

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
quite a good point significant in is in

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.820 
quite a good point significant in is in
a<00:04:33.890> cloverleaf

on the weekend really highlighted just

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
how limited my current camera is now the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.780 
how limited my current camera is now the

optical image stabilization starting to

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.940 
optical image stabilization starting to
fail<00:06:45.090> it's<00:06:45.330> gone<00:06:45.720> a<00:06:45.750> bit<00:06:45.810> wonky<00:06:46.110> so<00:06:46.740> some<00:06:46.920> of

other<00:06:48.180> than<00:06:48.240> I'd<00:06:48.389> hoped<00:06:48.630> and<00:06:48.990> I<00:06:49.620> shooting

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
other than I'd hoped and I shooting

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.590 
other than I'd hoped and I shooting
against<00:06:50.370> a<00:06:50.430> grey<00:06:50.639> sky<00:06:50.880> most<00:06:51.270> of<00:06:51.389> the<00:06:51.450> time

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
against a grey sky most of the time

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.659 
against a grey sky most of the time
which<00:06:51.720> made<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:51.930> very<00:06:51.990> difficult<00:06:52.380> to<00:06:52.889> produce

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
which made it very difficult to produce

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:54.980 
which made it very difficult to produce
anything<00:06:54.030> that<00:06:54.270> just<00:06:54.419> wasn't<00:06:54.570> a<00:06:54.690> silhouette

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
anything that just wasn't a silhouette

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.510 
anything that just wasn't a silhouette
of<00:06:55.110> a<00:06:55.230> model<00:06:55.410> against<00:06:55.680> the<00:06:55.800> gray<00:06:55.950> sky<00:06:56.280> you

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
of a model against the gray sky you

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.980 
of a model against the gray sky you
couldn't<00:06:56.790> get<00:06:56.880> the<00:06:56.970> detail<00:06:57.389> out<00:06:57.570> and<00:06:57.750> I<00:06:57.810> need

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
couldn't get the detail out and I need

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.230 
couldn't get the detail out and I need
more<00:06:58.169> control<00:06:58.530> over<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:59.340> yet<00:06:59.669> the<00:06:59.790> iris<00:07:00.090> and

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
more control over the yet the iris and

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.760 
more control over the yet the iris and
the<00:07:00.330> f-stop<00:07:00.690> and<00:07:00.840> I<00:07:00.900> sort<00:07:01.080> of<00:07:01.139> stuff<00:07:01.350> exposure

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
the f-stop and I sort of stuff exposure

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.650 
the f-stop and I sort of stuff exposure
shutter<00:07:02.070> rates<00:07:02.310> then<00:07:02.850> this<00:07:03.060> little<00:07:03.389> camera

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
shutter rates then this little camera

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.830 
shutter rates then this little camera
offers<00:07:03.870> in<00:07:04.080> a<00:07:04.139> bigger<00:07:04.470> light<00:07:05.040> capturing

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
offers in a bigger light capturing

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.700 
offers in a bigger light capturing
arrangement<00:07:06.840> with<00:07:06.930> the<00:07:07.020> biggest<00:07:07.320> sensors

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
arrangement with the biggest sensors

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.020 
arrangement with the biggest sensors
because<00:07:07.860> this<00:07:08.010> is<00:07:08.130> I<00:07:08.220> think<00:07:08.310> one<00:07:08.490> sixth<00:07:08.850> and

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
because this is I think one sixth and

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.030 
because this is I think one sixth and
senses<00:07:09.540> and<00:07:09.720> new<00:07:10.320> cameras<00:07:10.650> have<00:07:10.770> much<00:07:10.889> bigger

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
senses and new cameras have much bigger

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.230 
senses and new cameras have much bigger
sensor<00:07:11.460> so<00:07:11.580> they<00:07:11.669> work<00:07:11.790> better<00:07:11.940> in<00:07:12.090> lower

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
sensor so they work better in lower

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.300 
sensor so they work better in lower
light<00:07:12.360> like<00:07:12.870> we<00:07:12.990> had<00:07:13.110> on<00:07:13.200> the<00:07:13.230> weekend<00:07:13.500> so<00:07:14.190> and

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
light like we had on the weekend so and

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.490 
light like we had on the weekend so and
I<00:07:14.370> found<00:07:14.639> the<00:07:15.150> camera<00:07:15.389> that<00:07:15.780> would<00:07:15.930> suit<00:07:16.350> me

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
I found the camera that would suit me

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.350 
I found the camera that would suit me
down<00:07:16.919> to<00:07:17.220> the<00:07:17.250> ground<00:07:17.580> I<00:07:17.850> finally<00:07:18.240> after

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
down to the ground I finally after

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.120 
down to the ground I finally after
looking<00:07:18.660> through<00:07:18.720> page<00:07:19.380> after<00:07:19.410> page<00:07:19.770> of

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
looking through page after page of

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.610 
looking through page after page of
specifications<00:07:20.880> and<00:07:21.139> brochures<00:07:22.139> and<00:07:22.320> stuff<00:07:22.350> I

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
specifications and brochures and stuff I

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.780 
specifications and brochures and stuff I
finally<00:07:22.919> found<00:07:23.010> a<00:07:23.130> camera<00:07:23.370> that<00:07:23.400> seems<00:07:23.639> to

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
finally found a camera that seems to

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.300 
finally found a camera that seems to
tick<00:07:24.000> all<00:07:24.300> the<00:07:24.360> boxes<00:07:24.750> for<00:07:25.410> producing<00:07:25.800> my

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
tick all the boxes for producing my

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.770 
tick all the boxes for producing my
videos<00:07:26.639> and<00:07:27.090> the<00:07:27.150> only<00:07:27.300> downside<00:07:27.660> of<00:07:27.750> course

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
videos and the only downside of course

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.409 
videos and the only downside of course
is<00:07:27.960> it<00:07:28.110> is<00:07:28.200> $5,000<00:07:29.100> us<00:07:29.340> with<00:07:29.550> so<00:07:29.850> i<00:07:30.060> won't<00:07:30.360> be

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 
is it is $5,000 us with so i won't be
