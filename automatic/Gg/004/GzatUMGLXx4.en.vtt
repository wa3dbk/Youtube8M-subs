beginning of this process and it began

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
beginning of this process and it began
actually<00:00:59.969> 25<00:01:00.390> years<00:01:00.719> ago<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.809> by

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
actually 25 years ago so little by

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.050 
actually 25 years ago so little by
little<00:01:03.930> we've<00:01:04.409> made<00:01:04.680> those<00:01:04.949> baby<00:01:05.220> steps<00:01:05.400> and

little we've made those baby steps and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.140 
little we've made those baby steps and
to<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> point<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.369> making<00:01:08.909> our

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to the point now that we are making our

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.550 
to the point now that we are making our
families<00:01:09.689> living<00:01:09.960> without<00:01:10.290> tobacco<00:01:11.270> as<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
families living without tobacco as a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.440 
families living without tobacco as a
mainstay<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.010> farm<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.270> delighted

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
mainstay on the farm so I'm delighted

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
mainstay on the farm so I'm delighted
with<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.700> key

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
with that because I think that's the key

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
with that because I think that's the key
to<00:01:19.020> helping<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> farm<00:01:19.860> transition<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
to helping the farm transition to the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
to helping the farm transition to the
next<00:01:21.090> generation<00:01:21.950> that's<00:01:22.950> our<00:01:23.159> goal<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.700> wife

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
next generation that's our goal my wife

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
next generation that's our goal my wife
and<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.170> goal<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.979> we'd<00:01:26.130> like

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and I have that goal was that we'd like

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.310 
and I have that goal was that we'd like
to<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> farm<00:01:27.150> remain<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> family<00:01:28.110> farm

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to see this farm remain a family farm

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.460 
to see this farm remain a family farm
for<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.610> several<00:01:29.970> generations<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.930> mindset

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
for into several generations the mindset

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.190 
for into several generations the mindset
of<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.770> son<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> his<00:01:32.400> family<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.540> same<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
of my son and his family is the same so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
of my son and his family is the same so
there<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> potential<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> go<00:01:36.509> on

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
there is the potential for it to go on

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.710 
there is the potential for it to go on
but<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> takes<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.680> enterprise<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.720> here

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
but it takes an enterprise out here

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.590 
but it takes an enterprise out here
otherwise<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.130> farm<00:01:41.369> becomes<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.939> burden<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
otherwise the farm becomes a burden to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
otherwise the farm becomes a burden to
the<00:01:42.840> generation<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.500> doesn't<00:01:43.649> live<00:01:44.100> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the generation that doesn't live and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.990 
the generation that doesn't live and
work<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.619> excited<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.340> our

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
work here so I'm excited about our

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.770 
work here so I'm excited about our
prospects<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.500> future<00:01:50.630> what<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
prospects for that in the future what is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.350 
prospects for that in the future what is
difficult<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.860> us<00:01:53.040> though<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.880> we

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
difficult for us though is that we

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.080 
difficult for us though is that we
realize<00:01:54.750> how<00:01:55.020> vulnerable<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:56.060> when<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
realize how vulnerable we are when it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.219

procedures as far as handling that but

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.590 
procedures as far as handling that but
for<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> farmer<00:04:48.280> that's<00:04:48.400> outgrowing<00:04:48.910> vegetable

can get more history the risk management
has<00:04:57.730> gotten<00:04:58.660> on<00:04:58.780> board<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.530> has<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.610> organic

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
has gotten on board and has the organic

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.659 
has gotten on board and has the organic
practices<00:05:01.410> available<00:05:02.410> now<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.590> that's<00:05:03.400> been<00:05:03.610> a

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
practices available now so that's been a

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.930 
practices available now so that's been a
very<00:05:03.760> positive<00:05:04.180> thing<00:05:04.540> being<00:05:05.290> able<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.680> ensure

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
very positive thing being able to ensure

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.940 
very positive thing being able to ensure
organically<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.090> one<00:05:07.300> thing<00:05:07.570> but<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.440> problem

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
organically is one thing but the problem

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.360 
organically is one thing but the problem
is<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.639> is<00:05:10.000> we<00:05:10.479> don't<00:05:10.690> have<00:05:11.370> products

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
is is is we don't have products

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.140 
is is is we don't have products

we<00:05:25.360> have<00:05:25.750> nap<00:05:26.410> coverage<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:28.690> is<00:05:28.870> a

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
we have nap coverage and that is a

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.620 
we have nap coverage and that is a
bare-bones<00:05:29.919> kind<00:05:30.520> of<00:05:30.610> thing<00:05:30.820> it<00:05:31.030> is<00:05:31.180> it's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
bare-bones kind of thing it is it's

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.620 
bare-bones kind of thing it is it's
fairly<00:05:32.070> inexpensive<00:05:33.070> so<00:05:33.370> why<00:05:33.910> not<00:05:34.120> take<00:05:34.390> it

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
fairly inexpensive so why not take it

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.540 
fairly inexpensive so why not take it
you<00:05:34.810> would<00:05:34.930> get<00:05:35.110> something<00:05:35.680> but<00:05:36.130> you<00:05:36.280> have<00:05:36.310> to

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
you would get something but you have to

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.240 
you would get something but you have to
have<00:05:36.700> almost<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.330> complete<00:05:37.510> wipe<00:05:38.500> out<00:05:38.770> an<00:05:39.070> order

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
have almost a complete wipe out an order

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.529 
have almost a complete wipe out an order
for<00:05:39.550> us<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.700> have<00:05:40.450> any<00:05:41.700> collection<00:05:42.700> of<00:05:42.850> funds

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
for us to have any collection of funds

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.510 
for us to have any collection of funds
and<00:05:44.130> insurance<00:05:45.130> proceeds<00:05:45.729> in<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:47.169> so<00:05:47.560> if<00:05:48.430> you

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
and insurance proceeds in and so if you

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.279 
and insurance proceeds in and so if you
had<00:05:48.820> four<00:05:49.150> or<00:05:49.180> five<00:05:49.390> thousand<00:05:49.870> dollars<00:05:50.169> of

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
had four or five thousand dollars of

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.380 
had four or five thousand dollars of
coverage<00:05:50.770> what<00:05:50.979> is<00:05:51.130> that<00:05:51.370> compared<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.360> a

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
coverage what is that compared to a

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.120 
coverage what is that compared to a
strawberry<00:05:53.080> crop<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.350> has<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.830> potential

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
strawberry crop that has the potential

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.960 
strawberry crop that has the potential
of<00:05:54.400> yielding<00:05:55.360> forty<00:05:56.340> thousand<00:05:57.340> dollars<00:05:57.669> gross

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
of yielding forty thousand dollars gross

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.659 
of yielding forty thousand dollars gross
income<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:59.500> that's<00:06:00.070> what<00:06:00.250> we're<00:06:00.430> trying

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
income and so that's what we're trying

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.010 
income and so that's what we're trying
to<00:06:00.820> protect<00:06:01.270> that's<00:06:01.450> what<00:06:01.600> we<00:06:01.720> want<00:06:01.930> to

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
to protect that's what we want to

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.950 
to protect that's what we want to
protect<00:06:02.139> a<00:06:02.590> CSA<00:06:03.310> garden<00:06:03.820> two<00:06:04.030> acres<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.510> csa

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
protect a CSA garden two acres of csa

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.170 
protect a CSA garden two acres of csa
gardens<00:06:05.440> will<00:06:06.100> generate<00:06:06.610> 90<00:06:07.060> grand<00:06:07.330> of<00:06:07.830> income

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
gardens will generate 90 grand of income

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.279 
gardens will generate 90 grand of income
gross<00:06:10.180> income<00:06:11.010> you<00:06:12.010> know<00:06:12.270> so<00:06:13.270> we're<00:06:13.870> trying<00:06:14.050> to

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
gross income you know so we're trying to

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.230 
gross income you know so we're trying to
protect<00:06:14.680> that<00:06:14.860> so<00:06:15.490> if<00:06:15.580> we<00:06:15.760> were<00:06:15.940> to<00:06:16.060> have<00:06:16.210> a

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
this 25-acre confined area here we would

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.640 
this 25-acre confined area here we would
we<00:06:25.690> feel<00:06:25.900> like<00:06:27.570> that<00:06:28.570> we<00:06:28.750> have<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.410> hop<00:06:29.620> the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
we feel like that we have to hop the

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.120 
we feel like that we have to hop the
farm<00:06:30.039> in<00:06:30.340> order<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.760> be<00:06:30.940> able<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.510> pay<00:06:32.169> out<00:06:32.380> we

farm in order to be able to pay out we

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.420 
farm in order to be able to pay out we
see<00:06:33.490> this<00:06:34.120> is<00:06:34.450> is<00:06:34.720> our<00:06:35.050> future<00:06:35.560> you<00:06:36.070> know<00:06:36.190> this

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
see this is is our future you know this

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.220 
see this is is our future you know this
this<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.539> environment<00:06:38.580> this

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
this the environment this

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.480 
this the environment this
you<00:06:41.230> know<00:06:41.350> buying<00:06:41.860> local<00:06:43.440> where<00:06:44.440> people<00:06:45.310> know

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
you know buying local where people know

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.270 
you know buying local where people know
where<00:06:45.700> the<00:06:45.820> food<00:06:46.030> is<00:06:46.150> coming<00:06:46.390> from<00:06:46.570> that

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
where the food is coming from that

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.740 
where the food is coming from that
touches<00:06:48.280> people<00:06:48.700> it<00:06:48.880> connects<00:06:49.300> with<00:06:49.480> them

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
touches people it connects with them

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.320 
touches people it connects with them
that's<00:06:50.470> what<00:06:50.740> they<00:06:50.890> want<00:06:51.160> and<00:06:51.460> so<00:06:52.000> who<00:06:52.150> knows

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
that's what they want and so who knows

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.790 
that's what they want and so who knows
what's<00:06:52.690> going<00:06:52.930> to<00:06:52.990> happen<00:06:53.380> with<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.620> next

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
what's going to happen with the next

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.100 
what's going to happen with the next
generation<00:06:53.950> would<00:06:54.730> there<00:06:54.940> be<00:06:54.990> actually<00:06:55.990> the

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
generation would there be actually the

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.680 
generation would there be actually the
potential<00:06:56.590> for<00:06:56.740> three<00:06:57.100> generations<00:06:57.880> to<00:06:58.570> be

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
potential for three generations to be

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.870 
potential for three generations to be
working<00:06:59.140> here<00:06:59.350> on<00:06:59.470> the<00:06:59.650> farm<00:06:59.890> I<00:07:00.070> think<00:07:00.340> so<00:07:00.610> and

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
working here on the farm I think so and

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.820 
working here on the farm I think so and
so<00:07:02.610> well<00:07:03.610> but<00:07:03.790> with<00:07:03.970> each<00:07:04.240> expansion<00:07:04.840> there's

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
so well but with each expansion there's

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.090 
so well but with each expansion there's
greater<00:07:06.160> and<00:07:06.370> greater<00:07:06.490> risk<00:07:06.850> and<00:07:07.180> so<00:07:08.100> therein

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
greater and greater risk and so therein

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.290 
greater and greater risk and so therein
is<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.880> scary<00:07:10.480> part<00:07:10.810> and<00:07:11.100> so<00:07:12.100> if<00:07:12.430> we<00:07:12.460> felt<00:07:13.000> like

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
is the scary part and so if we felt like

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.690 
is the scary part and so if we felt like
that<00:07:13.540> we<00:07:13.720> had<00:07:14.640> coverage<00:07:15.640> of<00:07:15.880> our<00:07:15.970> risk<00:07:16.270> then<00:07:17.700> we

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
that we had coverage of our risk then we

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.190 
that we had coverage of our risk then we
would<00:07:18.850> be<00:07:19.060> a<00:07:19.090> little<00:07:19.300> more<00:07:19.450> at<00:07:19.660> ease<00:07:19.690> about

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.200 
would be a little more at ease about

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.460 
would be a little more at ease about
making<00:07:20.740> those<00:07:20.890> expansion<00:07:21.610> plans<00:07:22.290> we're<00:07:23.290> not

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
making those expansion plans we're not

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.100 
making those expansion plans we're not
waiting<00:07:23.740> on<00:07:23.890> crop<00:07:24.160> insurance<00:07:24.390> to<00:07:25.390> catch<00:07:25.870> up

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
waiting on crop insurance to catch up

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.440 
waiting on crop insurance to catch up
with<00:07:26.290> us<00:07:26.320> the<00:07:27.250> unfortunate<00:07:27.640> part<00:07:28.000> about<00:07:28.390> that

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
with us the unfortunate part about that

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.350 
with us the unfortunate part about that
is<00:07:29.050> that<00:07:29.110> we're<00:07:29.860> vulnerable<00:07:30.360> completely

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
is that we're vulnerable completely

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.130 
is that we're vulnerable completely
vulnerable<00:07:31.920> to<00:07:32.920> to<00:07:33.310> mother<00:07:33.490> nature<00:07:33.940> yes<00:07:34.480> so

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.140 
vulnerable to to mother nature yes so

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.050 
vulnerable to to mother nature yes so
crop<00:07:35.680> insurance<00:07:35.830> is<00:07:36.250> an<00:07:36.400> absolute<00:07:36.850> necessity

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.060 
crop insurance is an absolute necessity

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.250 
crop insurance is an absolute necessity
these<00:07:37.870> days<00:07:38.140> because<00:07:39.510> and<00:07:40.510> of<00:07:40.630> course<00:07:40.870> that's

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.260 
these days because and of course that's

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.520 
these days because and of course that's
why<00:07:41.530> we<00:07:41.740> feel<00:07:41.950> it<00:07:42.100> at<00:07:42.520> risk<00:07:42.790> and<00:07:43.210> we<00:07:44.020> know<00:07:44.230> that

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
why we feel it at risk and we know that

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.620 
why we feel it at risk and we know that
we<00:07:45.310> don't<00:07:45.490> have<00:07:45.700> proper<00:07:46.030> crop<00:07:46.390> insurance<00:07:46.570> and

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:48.630 
we don't have proper crop insurance and

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.870 
we don't have proper crop insurance and
you<00:07:49.630> know<00:07:49.890> we're<00:07:50.890> just<00:07:51.070> at<00:07:51.220> risk<00:07:51.460> that's<00:07:51.760> all

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:51.880 
you know we're just at risk that's all

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.120 
you know we're just at risk that's all
there<00:07:52.060> is<00:07:52.090> to<00:07:52.300> it<00:07:52.330> and<00:07:52.570> that<00:07:52.840> would<00:07:53.560> be<00:07:53.590> the<00:07:53.770> one

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.130 
there is to it and that would be the one

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:04.090 
there is to it and that would be the one
undoing<00:07:54.910> of<00:07:55.230> what<00:07:56.230> our<00:07:56.260> master<00:07:56.800> plan<00:07:56.830> is<00:07:57.310> here

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.100 

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:12.590 

you
