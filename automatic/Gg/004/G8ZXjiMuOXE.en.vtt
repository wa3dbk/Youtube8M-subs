 amoled 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.710
 how do you see the design very interesting 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.689
 because it's practically aluminum here 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.039
 in the part of the watch itself on the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.769
 right we have the power button 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.679
 if anything, switch off the strap 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.690
 it looks like fabric on the side instead 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.219

 directly from the device actually 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.379
 works in conjunction with another 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.639
 Android smartphone, however, we can anyway 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.959
 make calls directly from 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.850

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.299
 will allow us to record video and 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.159
 take pictures directly from 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.239

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.259
 internal device 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.659
 regarding the features 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.490
 real hardware we have in addition to 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.670

 device manages to connect to the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.500
 android smartphone with which 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.570
 use it 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.150
 as you see doing a swipe towards 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.830
 left to right is possible 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.120
 view the various applications 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.860
 let's start with notification notification 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.690
 allows us to view notifications 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.520
 of the smartphone 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.990
 if we click on a certain one 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400
 notification will be opened to us 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 the corresponding application of the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.880
 notification directly on the smartphone 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.830
 let's go back to go back 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.240
 we have to do it you have down 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.810
 voice memo with which we can 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.369
 record notes directly from 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.140
 device then with the microphone 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.850
 after which we have ice boys thanks to the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.080
 which we can obviously use 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.800
 graphic features we have a 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.800
 excellent to approve it 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.880
 uruguay all aids day 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.060
 as you can see, he answers us in a way 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.680
 immediate with in this case we have 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.600
 asked what the weather is like today 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.760
 answered with the weather forecast let's go 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.960
 back gallery where we can 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.050
 view the various photos we have 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.540
 snapped but not just videos the photos that 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.340
 we have loaded on the device 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.870
 this media controller here we can 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.570
 practically check for example the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.830
 music music on the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.320
 device on the android smartphone 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.790
 connected to the watch directly from the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.470
 his site in fact we click on play as 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.510
 you see the audio playback has started 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.740
 in this case on our galaxy 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.740
 nuccio 33 pause what settings for 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.110
 reset the via 10 and the language e 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.130
 let's say these basic things here 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.990
 applications with which we can 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.790
 use the whole point of the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.230
 situation with which we can say it 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.700
 among which are the applications they are 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.270
 fundamental for the coupling with the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.950
 device 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.050
 if in fact we go to our smartphone 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.240
 the galaxy has the folder 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.680
 clear p's here inside we have 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.720
 installed to the same applications that 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.209
 we can use on our watch 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.820
 if we go the manager already possible 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.819
 however, you can not go to the dying 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.799
 clock settings 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.409
 the various the various accommodations we can 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.420
 view on samsung ex device 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.909
 matera where we can practically 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.560
 install new applications and decide 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.060
 the order in which it leverages applications 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.709
 will be displayed within the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.879
 device 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.109
 after which we have settings a 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.219
 possibility to find directly in the 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.709
 our watch then through 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.950
 probably a gps receiver and so 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.159
 Street 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.420
 let's go back to the clock itself 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.250
 we go to open the camera there 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.829
 I show just what is in this 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.719
 case the maximum video recording 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.050
 recordings in 10 seconds 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.450
 let's pause 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.300
 if instead we understand it as you see 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.580
 in photos that will be taken a little 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.660
 slowly but fairly well but I have to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.280
 also the possibility to carry it out 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.140
 click directly via commands 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.930
 vocal settings we can 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.450
 choose size focus mode 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.770
 of the photo foundation that the function 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.180
 notches expert before and so on 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.170
 let's go back 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.300
 among other applications we can 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.120
 use 18 with directly from the or 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.830
 best to view chat messages 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.020
 directly from the device open the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.370
 dialers show you a little what the is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.360
 possibility to make calls to 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.490
 example we call fictitious number you see 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.580
 the call will start on ours 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.510
 device on 83 and we could talk 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.640
 directly the microphone below 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.660
 bayern screen that is possible 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.850
 in which you can also access 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.560
 directly from the home with a swipe 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.480
 towards given so very much way 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.000
 simple after which among other things 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.860
 we have in the call log 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.820
 contacts and so on then it is 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.920
 really a very device 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.560
 interesting and we will try to test it on 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.960
 as soon as possible because it is a 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.460
 revolution of this panorama and that is the 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.600
 panorama of the smartbooks by emanuele 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.560
 cavani is all for the moment for 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.560
 android puntonet
