00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
confused as to how many videos I've been

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.980 
confused as to how many videos I've been
putting<00:00:22.900> out<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.820> from<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.970> views<00:00:25.660> that<00:00:25.690> the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
putting out and from the views that the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.510 
putting out and from the views that the
videos<00:00:26.289> have<00:00:26.470> been<00:00:26.560> getting<00:00:26.920> I<00:00:27.039> can<00:00:27.310> tell<00:00:27.490> that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
videos have been getting I can tell that

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.790 
videos have been getting I can tell that
some<00:00:27.940> videos<00:00:28.270> have<00:00:28.539> been<00:00:28.690> watched<00:00:29.110> a<00:00:29.380> lot<00:00:29.560> more

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
some videos have been watched a lot more

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.350 
some videos have been watched a lot more
than<00:00:30.010> others<00:00:30.340> even<00:00:30.580> though<00:00:30.789> they<00:00:30.940> go<00:00:31.090> up<00:00:31.210> at

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
than others even though they go up at

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.930 
than others even though they go up at
the<00:00:31.390> same<00:00:31.660> time<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.319> the<00:00:33.190> reason<00:00:33.519> for<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.760> is

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
the same time and the reason for this is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.610 
the same time and the reason for this is
because<00:00:33.969> I'm<00:00:34.390> putting<00:00:34.719> out<00:00:34.839> a<00:00:34.870> lot<00:00:35.199> of<00:00:35.319> videos

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
because I'm putting out a lot of videos

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.419 
because I'm putting out a lot of videos

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
for follow samurai at once because you

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:40.709

know it's fresh and everything and I

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.719 
know it's fresh and everything and I
like<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.589> give<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.890> option<00:00:42.039> to<00:00:42.249> click<00:00:42.489> the

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
episode has a number at the end of it so

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.929 
episode has a number at the end of it so
something<00:01:08.590> like<00:01:08.619> this<00:01:08.829> like<00:01:09.009> number<00:01:09.340> five<00:01:09.579> or

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
maybe number six that means that that's

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.160

here you can go in this you can go in
here<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.460> I'll<00:01:30.850> talk<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.119> little<00:01:31.329> bit<00:01:31.479> about<00:01:31.600> my

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
here and I'll talk a little bit about my

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.660 
here and I'll talk a little bit about my
veterans<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.409> about<00:01:32.560> New<00:01:32.799> Territories<00:01:33.070> and

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
veterans and about New Territories and

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.419 
veterans and about New Territories and
then<00:01:34.210> somewhere<00:01:34.600> around<00:01:34.750> here<00:01:35.049> I'll<00:01:35.679> put<00:01:36.250> the

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
then somewhere around here I'll put the

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.249 
then somewhere around here I'll put the
annotations<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.179> these<00:01:37.390> annotations<00:01:37.899> are

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
annotations and these annotations are

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.980 
annotations and these annotations are
clickable<00:01:38.649> so<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:39.969> actually<00:01:40.149> click<00:01:40.689> and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
clickable so you can actually click and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.719 
clickable so you can actually click and
you<00:01:41.409> can<00:01:41.560> see<00:01:41.710> each<00:01:41.890> one<00:01:42.100> represents<00:01:42.640> a

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
you can see each one represents a

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.639 
you can see each one represents a
different<00:01:42.850> battle<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.869> once<00:01:44.079> you<00:01:44.200> go<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
different battle so once you go to the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.620 
different battle so once you go to the
first<00:01:44.920> one<00:01:45.100> for<00:01:45.310> example<00:01:45.729> battle<00:01:46.149> number<00:01:46.240> 5

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
first one for example battle number 5

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.190 
first one for example battle number 5
you<00:01:47.560> can<00:01:47.710> watch<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.189> one<00:01:48.429> if<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.759> want<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
you can watch that one if you want and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.230 
you can watch that one if you want and
then<00:01:50.380> here<00:01:50.859> there'll<00:01:51.159> be<00:01:51.189> more<00:01:51.490> annotations

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
then here there'll be more annotations

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.239 
then here there'll be more annotations
that<00:01:52.450> allow<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.200> either<00:01:53.380> go<00:01:53.619> back<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
that allow you to either go back to the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.309 
that allow you to either go back to the
map<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.149> can<00:01:55.329> either<00:01:55.420> go<00:01:55.689> back<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.200> map

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
map so you can either go back to the map

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.200 
map so you can either go back to the map
over<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:56.920> then<00:01:57.100> you'll<00:01:57.249> be<00:01:57.399> linked

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
i'll publish more than one video at a

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.670 
i'll publish more than one video at a
time<00:05:47.240> hopefully<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.810> won't<00:05:47.960> be<00:05:48.050> overwhelming

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
time hopefully it won't be overwhelming

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.830 
time hopefully it won't be overwhelming
and<00:05:48.860> you<00:05:49.850> know<00:05:49.940> you'd<00:05:50.060> be<00:05:50.090> able<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.480> watch<00:05:50.600> all

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
and you know you'd be able to watch all

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.290 
and you know you'd be able to watch all
of<00:05:50.900> them<00:05:51.170> in<00:05:51.380> time<00:05:51.980> and<00:05:52.280> usually<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:53.030> videos

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
of them in time and usually the videos

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.790 
of them in time and usually the videos
aren't<00:05:53.540> really<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:53.930> long<00:05:54.140> so<00:05:54.410> if<00:05:54.500> you<00:05:54.590> sit

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
aren't really that long so if you sit

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.290 
aren't really that long so if you sit
through<00:05:55.040> them<00:05:55.220> it'll<00:05:55.430> be<00:05:55.490> probably<00:05:55.790> like<00:05:55.940> 30

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
through them it'll be probably like 30

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.700 
through them it'll be probably like 30
minutes<00:05:56.540> and<00:05:56.810> then<00:05:56.870> you'll<00:05:57.050> watch<00:05:57.230> a<00:05:57.380> big

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.510 
minutes and then you'll watch a big
