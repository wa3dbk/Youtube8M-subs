00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.449 
here she can load more than one show in
so<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.030> did<00:02:28.269> this<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.840> first<00:02:28.870> time

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
so if you like I did this the first time

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.570 
so if you like I did this the first time
then<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.880> know<00:02:31.030> you've<00:02:31.269> got

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
then you know you've got

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.980 
then you know you've got
one<00:02:32.730> chance<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.240> hit<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.240> smaller<00:02:36.660> gun

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
one chance to hit it it's a smaller gun

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.350 
one chance to hit it it's a smaller gun
see<00:02:37.890> how<00:02:38.010> small<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:39.110> compared<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
see how small that is compared to the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.770 
see how small that is compared to the
bigger<00:02:42.770> 308<00:02:45.680> 308<00:02:46.680> heavier<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:48.120> actually<00:02:48.750> I

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
bigger 308 308 heavier but actually I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.220 
bigger 308 308 heavier but actually I
figured<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:50.040> heavier<00:02:50.760> gun<00:02:51.230> produces

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
figured out that a heavier gun produces

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.010 
figured out that a heavier gun produces
look<00:02:52.590> less<00:02:52.860> recoil<00:02:53.130> don't<00:02:53.580> ask<00:02:53.730> me<00:02:53.940> why<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.450> just

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
look less recoil don't ask me why I just

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.400 
look less recoil don't ask me why I just
figured<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.530> out

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
figured that out

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
figured that out
yeah<00:02:58.410> 3030<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> pretty<00:02:59.280> good<00:02:59.460> gun<00:02:59.640> good

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
yeah 3030 it's a pretty good gun good

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.850
