00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.289

 agreement once you have it, it will come out 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.650
 this folder 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 this is the module of agreement then 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.190
 let's go with the installation steps 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.720
 to show you how to download little to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.520
 little and the first one that you have to do 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.580
 is to go to your home button here 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.950
 windows and write percentage app data 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.720
 percentage and there will come out the folder 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 roaming to which you access and once 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.290
 you are the roaming folder you are about to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.970
 minecraft and here you are looking for the folder that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.610
 it's called versions or better versions 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.440
 said that is the last one you give here and 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.019
 you are going to make a copy of this folder 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 according to 1.6 point 1 and then you 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.750
 dais to paste once the copy is made 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.050
 the vais 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.000
 and you're going to call it 1.6 point 1 mod 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.860
 loader agree to capitalize it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.130
 as I have it here and you are going to call it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310
 this folder agree then 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.560
 we should go inside this folder 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 1.6 point 1 mod loader and here within 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.119
 agreement rename these two files 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 both in 1.6 point 1 and this 1.6 point 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.000
 1 point j are we go with the first the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 1.6 point 1 and add the cloud air mode 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 agree if it is edited and the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.329
 next the same 1.6 point 1 and here what 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.299
 The only thing we do is add also matt 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.829
 loader of agreement here is very well a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.789
 once we have these two steps completed 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.189
 according to the only thing we have to 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.220
 do is open this the first 1 points 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.659
 6.1 motlow der and open with winrar a 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.520
 Once it is open, the folder will come out 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.990
 with the files indicated within 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 agreement the only thing that we will have to do 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.909
 it's basically copying all the files 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.409
 of the mod in question of our folder 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.649
 of mod loader that we have downloaded 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.360
 and drag them to the 1.6 point 1 folder 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.130
 mod load the one that we just renamed 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.079
 we accept accepting it by assuming 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.160
 you always have to add and replace and already 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.110
 everything would be done the only thing that we 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.540
 would do is delete this folder 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.940
 here agree and we would have the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.260
 first step of the installed mod in accordance 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.120
 we would have to do the following 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.090
 also the next adjustment with 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.819
 next file that is 1.1 or 1 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.319
 points 6.1 cloud mode the j are what 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.260
 we would have and we will open it with the pad 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.879
 of notes of agreement here we open with the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.069
 notebook and here we will have to 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.440
 add in 1.6 point 1 also mod 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.390
 loader and not remove it from the quotes only 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.819
 we will have to give it to save and it is already 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.610
 guys we would have installed our 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.250
 way to see and it would work now 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.870
 we would just have to go to our 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.000
 say launcher main fork according 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.799
 and we could choose the one we wanted and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.599
 catch and masters realism laude according 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.709
 it would be all done we give to play for 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.440
 work that we do not have left in 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.359
 black screen and voilà if the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.250
