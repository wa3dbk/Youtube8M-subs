down or screen clearing abilities but
the<00:00:59.550> main<00:00:59.699> issue<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.359> fast<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the main issue here is how fast the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
the main issue here is how fast the
balls<00:01:00.960> move<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> how<00:01:01.829> quickly<00:01:02.100> new<00:01:02.399> mechanics

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
balls move and how quickly new mechanics

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.030 
balls move and how quickly new mechanics
are<00:01:02.969> added<00:01:03.350> introduced<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> second<00:01:04.890> stage

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
are added introduced in the second stage

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.830 
are added introduced in the second stage
is<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> mechanic<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> combining<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.510> colors

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
is the mechanic of combining two colors

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.359 
is the mechanic of combining two colors
plus<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.439> light<00:01:07.619> button<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> take<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
plus the light button to take on

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.700 
plus the light button to take on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
different colored wolves then in stage 3

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.200 
different colored wolves then in stage 3
it's<00:01:10.830> combining<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.369> three<00:01:11.430> colors<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.090> take

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's combining all three colors to take

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's combining all three colors to take
on<00:01:12.360> gray<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.780> white<00:01:13.049> wolves<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:14.310> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
on gray and white wolves and then in

dark button the game mixes up all of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.890 
dark button the game mixes up all of
these<00:01:20.520> mechanics<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.119> away<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.720> wolf

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
these mechanics right away and if a wolf

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
these mechanics right away and if a wolf
gets<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.130> game<00:01:23.729> over<00:01:23.909> time<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
start again the fast pace means you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
start again the fast pace means you
succeed<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.509> fail<00:01:27.540> based<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.259> quickly

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
succeed or fail based on how quickly

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
succeed or fail based on how quickly

respond to the wolf onslaught and while

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.679 
respond to the wolf onslaught and while
