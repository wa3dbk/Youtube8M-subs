00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.700 

well<00:00:08.000> we<00:00:08.360> tend<00:00:09.050> to<00:00:09.400> blur<00:00:10.400> the<00:00:10.670> difference

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
well we tend to blur the difference

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.800 
well we tend to blur the difference
between<00:00:14.379> application<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:15.650> infrastructure

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
between application and infrastructure

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.960 
between application and infrastructure
and<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.289> coined<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.830> term<00:00:19.039> infrastructure

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
and I coined the term infrastructure

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.120 
and I coined the term infrastructure
application<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.039> what<00:00:22.039> that<00:00:22.220> is<00:00:22.250> is

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
application and what that is is

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.520 
application and what that is is
infrastructure<00:00:25.420> that<00:00:26.420> solves<00:00:27.110> a<00:00:27.200> business

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
infrastructure that solves a business

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.600 
infrastructure that solves a business
problem<00:00:28.390> so<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:29.840> has<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.110> be<00:00:30.410> scalable<00:00:31.190> robust

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
problem so it has to be scalable robust

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.850 
problem so it has to be scalable robust
secure<00:00:32.590> like<00:00:33.590> infrastructure<00:00:34.989> but<00:00:35.989> it<00:00:36.260> solves

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
secure like infrastructure but it solves

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.329 
secure like infrastructure but it solves
a<00:00:36.980> business<00:00:37.309> problem<00:00:38.620> like<00:00:39.620> an<00:00:39.769> application

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
a business problem like an application

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.399 
a business problem like an application
so<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.149> coined<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:41.570> term<00:00:41.629> to<00:00:41.989> describe<00:00:42.109> what

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
so I coined this term to describe what

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.729 
so I coined this term to describe what
we<00:00:42.559> do<00:00:42.710> as<00:00:42.980> an<00:00:43.280> infrastructure<00:00:43.850> application

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
we do as an infrastructure application

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.829 
we do as an infrastructure application
and<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.249> is<00:00:46.670> very<00:00:46.909> much<00:00:47.269> in<00:00:47.480> keeping<00:00:47.600> with

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
and that is very much in keeping with

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.759 
and that is very much in keeping with
our<00:00:48.409> enterprise<00:00:49.039> 3<00:00:49.339> or<00:00:49.879> vision<00:00:50.569> move<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.710> a

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
our enterprise 3 or vision move to a

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.160 
our enterprise 3 or vision move to a
clown<00:00:52.069> move<00:00:52.489> through<00:00:52.819> software<00:00:53.179> not<00:00:54.019> as<00:00:54.140> a

clown move through software not as a

clown move through software not as a
service<00:00:54.589> but<00:00:54.769> as<00:00:54.859> a<00:00:54.890> self<00:00:55.159> service<00:00:55.929> and<00:00:56.929> that's

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
service but as a self service and that's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.259 
service but as a self service and that's
what<00:00:57.829> our<00:00:57.859> customers<00:00:58.339> are<00:00:58.670> demanding<00:00:58.879> more

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
what our customers are demanding more

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.569 
what our customers are demanding more
and<00:00:59.510> more<00:00:59.749> they<00:01:00.710> want<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:01.010> control<00:01:01.280> over<00:01:01.429> their

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
and more they want a control over their

and more they want a control over their
own<00:01:01.609> destiny<00:01:01.729> they<00:01:02.300> want<00:01:02.479> to<00:01:02.539> be<00:01:02.629> able<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:03.019> get

own destiny they want to be able to get

own destiny they want to be able to get
up<00:01:03.859> in<00:01:03.979> a<00:01:04.010> Friday<00:01:04.250> invent<00:01:04.850> something<00:01:05.600> new<00:01:05.810> for

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
up in a Friday invent something new for

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.410 
up in a Friday invent something new for
their<00:01:06.320> customer<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.070> have<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.090> be

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
their customer and have it be

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.540 
their customer and have it be
provisioned<00:01:09.049> by<00:01:09.260> Monday<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:11.150> really<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
provisioned by Monday so really the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.580 
provisioned by Monday so really the
distinction<00:01:13.550> between<00:01:14.540> an<00:01:14.900> application<00:01:15.470> in

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
distinction between an application in

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.710 
distinction between an application in
the<00:01:15.620> infrastructure<00:01:15.980> is<00:01:16.940> starting<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.510> blur

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
the infrastructure is starting to blur

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.860 
the infrastructure is starting to blur
it<00:01:18.020> used<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.860> be<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.250> when<00:01:19.550> I<00:01:19.640> was<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:19.850> kid<00:01:19.940> that

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
it used to be that when I was a kid that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.820 
it used to be that when I was a kid that
what<00:01:21.230> was<00:01:21.730> in<00:01:22.730> my<00:01:23.210> parents<00:01:23.810> office<00:01:24.230> the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
what was in my parents office the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.130 
what was in my parents office the
technology<00:01:25.370> they<00:01:25.520> had<00:01:25.760> was<00:01:26.420> far<00:01:26.660> superior<00:01:26.810> to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
technology they had was far superior to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.280 
technology they had was far superior to
anything<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.650> could<00:01:27.830> have<00:01:27.860> at<00:01:28.130> home<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:29.290> has

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
anything I could have at home that has

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.100 
anything I could have at home that has
now<00:01:30.440> been<00:01:30.680> inverted<00:01:31.210> where<00:01:32.210> what<00:01:32.510> kids<00:01:32.840> have

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
now been inverted where what kids have

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.860 
now been inverted where what kids have

facebook is far superior to what people

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.550 
facebook is far superior to what people
have<00:01:40.100> in<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.430> office<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:42.290> when<00:01:42.440> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
have in the office and so when the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.500 
have in the office and so when the
business<00:01:42.860> person<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.280> CEO<00:01:43.670> goes<00:01:43.940> home<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.420> he

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
business person the CEO goes home and he

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.140 
business person the CEO goes home and he
sees<00:01:44.720> what<00:01:44.930> his<00:01:45.050> kids<00:01:45.260> are<00:01:45.380> doing<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:47.060> he

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
sees what his kids are doing and then he

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.810 
sees what his kids are doing and then he
goes<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.480> office<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> next<00:01:48.050> day<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.820> it's

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
goes to the office the next day and it's

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.360 
goes to the office the next day and it's
going<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.030> take<00:01:50.210> how<00:01:50.390> long<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:51.680> implement<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
going to take how long to implement the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.750 
going to take how long to implement the
new<00:01:52.490> process<00:01:54.040> but<00:01:55.040> my<00:01:55.130> daughter<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:55.550> did

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
new process but my daughter just did

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.700 
new process but my daughter just did
that<00:01:55.940> in<00:01:56.480> minutes<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.320> she's<00:01:58.250> ten<00:01:58.430> years<00:01:58.460> old

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
that in minutes and she's ten years old

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.730 
that in minutes and she's ten years old
so<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.700> business<00:02:02.030> person<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:02.720> very<00:02:03.409> much

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
so the business person is very much

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.540 
so the business person is very much
driving<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.610> change<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:06.220> they're<00:02:07.220> seeing

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
driving the change and they're seeing

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.580 
driving the change and they're seeing
proof<00:02:08.450> points<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.989> what's<00:02:09.170> happening

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
proof points of what's happening

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.339 
proof points of what's happening
well<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.190> they're<00:02:10.789> asking<00:02:10.970> why<00:02:11.930> they<00:02:12.110> can't

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
well and they're asking why they can't

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.960 
well and they're asking why they can't
have<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.709> same<00:02:12.920> kind<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.220> agility<00:02:13.550> and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
have that same kind of agility and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.660 
have that same kind of agility and
self-service<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:15.290> their<00:02:15.709> own<00:02:15.860> corporate

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
self-service in their own corporate

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.479 
self-service in their own corporate
environment<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.540> still<00:02:17.830> hard<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.129> teach

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
environment so it's still hard to teach

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.440 
environment so it's still hard to teach
an<00:02:20.300> engineering<00:02:20.780> company<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:25.450> things

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
an engineering company to do things

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.750 
an engineering company to do things
differently<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.200> have<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.220> having<00:02:28.700> to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
differently but have you having to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.339 
differently but have you having to
communicate<00:02:29.180> with<00:02:29.209> business<00:02:29.569> people<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.080> end

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
communicate with business people and end

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.190 
communicate with business people and end
users<00:02:31.629> but<00:02:32.629> it's<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:32.930> easier<00:02:33.349> and<00:02:35.200> we're

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
users but it's not easier and we're

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.289

it's a hard platform to build but it's
it's<00:02:59.090> worth<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.480> because<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:01.069> allows<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.549> to
