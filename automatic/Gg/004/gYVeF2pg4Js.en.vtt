00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hi everyone, today is May 20, 2014. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 We're going now to the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.469
 concessionaire the wave to know how 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 will be the outcome of a scooter like this. 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.330
 which I acquire 11 months ago zero 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 kilometer at botafogo's concessionaire 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 and this Saturday she now with 2 thousand and 900 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.640
 km wheeled 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.460
 she started to make a noise 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.399
 amazing in the side cover in addition to the motor 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.190
 that I believe there is an inner part 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.020
 has come loose and listening has begun 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 losing power was in the neighborhood of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 cat 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.140
 I had to go back by taxi. 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.719
 then I went there to get her that I did not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.809
 stole a trailer on Saturday 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 I decided to bring it by pushing for 12 km 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.710
 It took me almost two hours and I left it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 near the dealership 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 on Monday as soon as 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.430
 Sponsored links 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.090
 I presented my need to them. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.720
 to use the guarantee and the girl that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 received very kindly made the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.909
 service and told me it will depend on 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.479
 round to prove 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.150
 I'm going to the dealership now. 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.030
 I decided to document the entire 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.000
 context of this episode so that all 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 users or future users of the brand 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 the wave has a real notion of what goes 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.360
 if you need to use the warranty 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.939
 can be an easy ending as I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.119
 I hope it is or can become a 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.310
 painful episode that only those who will lose 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.920
 the mark round because I 'm going to publish 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.470
 this on youtube so that everyone has 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.470
 right to know the reality of the facts 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.760
 We're arriving at the Honda dealer. 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:11.940
 to know how the context is going to be 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.940
 of the pc x 150 warranty 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 Who the manager of the party speaks my 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.349
 Honey, they already opened the engine 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.180
 there is no next word that here we 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.239
 we are doing a story about how 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 the wave guarantee runs such will be 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.900
 posted on youtube for the whole brazil 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.739
 how long it takes the case to a 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.420
 vehicle under the present warranty 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.879
 problem and what will be the degree of 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.060
 difficulty that the owner of the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.409
 vehicle will have to deal with the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.760
 technical assistance 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.099
 here you will stay here for you 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.980
 show to the board what is already 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.689
 it's posted on facebook today several 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.019
 People already clicked everyone is 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.629
 curious to know how this novel 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.689
 if it's going to be a beautiful novel a novel 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.859
 for the motorcycle owner 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:22.220
 had I left the motorcycle Monday? 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:29.329
 here to be evaluated and so far 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:32.209
 nobody stirred up in anything is that when 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.489
 opens the cover before handling 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.849
 Anything I wanted to be able to record 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.220
 What got loose in there is okay. 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.389
 I do not want open close concert say 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.669
 that's alright 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.280
 I want you to show me what the 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.099
 Fuzz went to the door because it 's a thing. 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.260
 Unbelievable vehicle with four thousand 900 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.609
 kilometers of the honda brand drop a 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.099
 engine part 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.169
 So the thing that the whole Brazil is going to 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.930
 be curious to know why with a 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.849
 motorcycle with less than one year of use 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.629
 presented a defect so I was 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.540
 normal walking is mine and I only ask you 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.569
 this ok 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.069
 I want to ask you to contact me. 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.109
 It takes a month to finish guarantee then 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.829
 I hope you do not make this time. 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:21.009
 I think what counts is aa date 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.610
 Her entry was the Monday 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.159
 talk 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.919
 I wait for you to open the engine for me. 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:30.469
 call me to document what I 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.180
 is what actually happened and we see the 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.949
 end of the context as 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.630
 Those are good, I know that 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.479
 dealer has nothing to do with 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.400
 procedure of the matrix wheel but only 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.350
 that this procedure has to be all 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.150
 made known to everyone is a 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.310
 Very rare case, I have no doubt. 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.830
 rondon brand I consider the best brand of 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.690
 bikes in Brazil but I want everything 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.539
 world has learned that if it comes to 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.639
 to give fault what is the job that the guy 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.410
 will have to get it right 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.110
 because I only have her as a vehicle 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.820
 so I'm spending 250l taxi per day 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.340
 Let's see if I'll take a month and a half. 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.560
 spending a taxi that this all goes one day 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.650
 be charged also the wave I 'm going to run 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.710
 behind my right and let's see if it goes 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.039
 have a happy ending a bad end to the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.259
 round so that's it here you show the 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.539

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.620

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.539

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.229
 with the dealership that was the place 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.300
 I bought the bike here in Botafogo for 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.880
 what I bring here that prioritized 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.650
 another concessionaire could claim that the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.750
 I had to take the place that you 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.490
 bought it so I came here in the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.150
 dealer is waiting for the contact 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:50.180

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:01.520
 we are in front of the motorcycle dealership 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.840

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.570
 loud on Saturday and she missed the 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.180
 power, I think you released the 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.860
 a part inside the engine 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.979
 I brought it here and I'm waiting. 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.289
 now the dealership procedure 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.720
 contact the manufacturer for 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.240
 see how the guarantee will happen 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.909
 we decided to document all this 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.800
 context so that all users 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.599
 of motorcycles 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.960
 those who already own the team go round 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:44.490
 intend to have a wave has the notion 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.610
 exact of what goes 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.550
 die if need be necessary 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.819
 use the warranty within the 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.819
 one year
