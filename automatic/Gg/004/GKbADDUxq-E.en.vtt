reasonable I used to use iron lungs but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.740 
reasonable I used to use iron lungs but
the<00:00:26.279> only<00:00:26.400> reason<00:00:26.490> why<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> don't<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.510> them<00:00:27.720> now

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the only reason why I don't use them now

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.599 
the only reason why I don't use them now
is<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.740> don't<00:00:28.980> hold<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:29.369> breath<00:00:29.580> for

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is because I don't hold my breath for

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.810 
is because I don't hold my breath for
that<00:00:29.910> long<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.480> don't<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.529> need<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> and

that long so don't really need it and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.030 
that long so don't really need it and

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
they're all spawning down there and

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.200 
they're all spawning down there and
I'm<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.739> sort<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:19.819> spawn<00:04:20.479> killing<00:04:20.900> them<00:04:21.199> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
I'm just sort of spawn killing them and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.700 
I'm just sort of spawn killing them and
a<00:04:23.210> lot<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.419> people<00:04:23.539> say<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:23.930> spawn<00:04:24.440> killing

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
a lot of people say that spawn killing

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.520 
a lot of people say that spawn killing
is<00:04:25.009> old<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:26.090> love<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.419> shot<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:27.139> don't<00:04:27.440> know

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
is old and I love that shot I don't know

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.010 
is old and I love that shot I don't know
why<00:04:27.680> it's<00:04:28.009> just<00:04:28.220> sort<00:04:28.400> of<00:04:28.460> like<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.690> no<00:04:29.690> scope

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
why it's just sort of like a no scope

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.320 
why it's just sort of like a no scope
quick<00:04:30.349> scope<00:04:30.680> sort<00:04:30.949> of<00:04:31.039> thing<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.120> lot<00:04:32.300> of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
quick scope sort of thing but a lot of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.600 
quick scope sort of thing but a lot of
people<00:04:32.539> think<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.199> spawn<00:04:34.009> killing<00:04:34.340> is

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
people think that a spawn killing is

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.879 
people think that a spawn killing is
really<00:04:35.180> inconsiderate<00:04:35.780> but<00:04:36.110> i<00:04:36.319> think<00:04:36.770> it's

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
really inconsiderate but i think it's

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.309 
really inconsiderate but i think it's
just<00:04:37.039> part<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.340> game<00:04:37.430> like<00:04:37.960> Call<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:38.990> Duty

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
just part of the game like Call of Duty

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.080 
just part of the game like Call of Duty
is<00:04:39.380> built<00:04:39.770> with<00:04:39.889> such<00:04:40.069> a<00:04:40.130> retarded<00:04:40.400> spawn

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
is built with such a retarded spawn

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.600 
is built with such a retarded spawn
system<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.900> if<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.830> don't<00:04:43.009> spawn<00:04:43.280> kill

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
system that if you don't spawn kill

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.400 
system that if you don't spawn kill
people<00:04:44.150> are<00:04:44.240> going<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.449> spawn<00:04:44.660> kill<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.169> or

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
and after practicing difficult shots for

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.770 
and after practicing difficult shots for
certain<00:05:43.669> amount<00:05:43.759> of<00:05:43.940> time<00:05:44.120> you're<00:05:44.360> eventually

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
certain amount of time you're eventually

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.360 
certain amount of time you're eventually
just<00:05:44.930> going<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.199> be<00:05:45.409> able<00:05:45.889> to<00:05:46.009> make<00:05:46.130> them

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
just going to be able to make them

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.050 
just going to be able to make them
consistently<00:05:47.409> like<00:05:48.409> I'm<00:05:49.130> not<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:49.880> greatest

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
consistently like I'm not the greatest

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.959 
consistently like I'm not the greatest
sniper<00:05:50.509> but<00:05:50.960> I<00:05:51.229> think<00:05:51.740> I'm<00:05:51.860> above<00:05:52.159> average<00:05:52.370> and

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
sniper but I think I'm above average and

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.350 
sniper but I think I'm above average and
I<00:05:53.539> can<00:05:54.110> sometimes<00:05:55.039> make<00:05:55.280> difficult<00:05:56.090> shots

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
I can sometimes make difficult shots

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.290 
I can sometimes make difficult shots
like<00:05:56.630> by<00:05:57.469> no<00:05:57.530> means<00:05:57.949> I'm<00:05:58.159> I<00:05:58.340> hit<00:05:58.969> a<00:05:59.000> hundred

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
like by no means I'm I hit a hundred

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.930 
like by no means I'm I hit a hundred
percent<00:05:59.509> of<00:05:59.719> my<00:05:59.840> bullets<00:06:00.229> but<00:06:00.500> I'd<00:06:01.099> say<00:06:01.370> I<00:06:01.400> I

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
percent of my bullets but I'd say I I

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.689 
percent of my bullets but I'd say I I
can<00:06:02.930> hit<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.580> majority<00:06:04.580> of<00:06:04.610> my<00:06:04.820> shots<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:07.550> the

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
can hit the majority of my shots so the

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.339 
can hit the majority of my shots so the
game<00:06:07.880> is<00:06:07.909> coming<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.419> an<00:06:08.509> end<00:06:08.630> here<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.169> I

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
game is coming to an end here and I

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.560 
game is coming to an end here and I
don't<00:06:09.979> think<00:06:10.099> I<00:06:10.250> get<00:06:10.430> any<00:06:10.580> more<00:06:10.759> kills<00:06:11.090> but<00:06:11.539> I

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
don't think I get any more kills but I

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.740 
don't think I get any more kills but I
get<00:06:11.840> one<00:06:12.110> more<00:06:12.259> death<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:13.610> there's<00:06:14.599> nothing

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
get one more death so there's nothing

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.860 
get one more death so there's nothing
