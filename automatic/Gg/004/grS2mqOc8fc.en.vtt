00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
sorry but we could not do that so we

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.820 
sorry but we could not do that so we
chose<00:05:28.120> just<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.630> do<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.960> pork<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.560> ground

beef and the andouille sausage

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.470 
beef and the andouille sausage
I<00:05:34.470> think<00:05:35.470> this<00:05:35.620> about<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:36.070> do<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.430> now<00:05:37.420> we

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
I think this about to do it now we

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.940 
I think this about to do it now we
didn't<00:05:37.840> season<00:05:38.230> the<00:05:38.290> meat<00:05:38.500> while<00:05:38.680> we<00:05:38.830> were

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
didn't season the meat while we were

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.590 
didn't season the meat while we were
cooking<00:05:39.160> it<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.550> even<00:05:39.820> would<00:05:39.970> normally<00:05:40.420> put

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
cooking it you even would normally put

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.930 
cooking it you even would normally put
tony's<00:05:41.050> on<00:05:41.200> at<00:05:41.410> that<00:05:41.560> time<00:05:41.800> but<00:05:42.700> we<00:05:42.790> weren't

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
tony's on at that time but we weren't

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.940 
tony's on at that time but we weren't
sure<00:05:43.060> how<00:05:43.300> hot<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:43.600> andouille<00:05:44.200> sausage<00:05:44.740> was

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
sure how hot that andouille sausage was

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.760 
sure how hot that andouille sausage was
so<00:05:45.880> at<00:05:46.240> this<00:05:46.540> point<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:47.110> might<00:05:47.260> want<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.560> um

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
so at this point you might want to um

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.100 
so at this point you might want to um
season<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.760> taste<00:05:49.000> with<00:05:49.180> salt<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.720> pepper<00:05:49.750> or
