 handle 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
 handle 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.119
 all arrested on video found 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.070
 like the right footage to show you the winter plot instant operation 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.939
 after upgrading mail android and non operating system. zero. 1 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.730
 the update that remembers was released a few hours ago by motorola non 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.760
 you have still seen available via ota but only through and the appropriate software 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.289
 connecting the phone to the pc the first novelty we meet the new one 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.960
 lockscreen as we can see we have and two buttons to drag and so 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.089
 quite similar open but only now they are and arranged horizontally 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430
 unblock ends this way 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.560
 we have is therefore that the new 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.090
 daniela adopts a writer 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.220
 as you can see a practically nothing changed this background there 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.549
 I customized with those of the nexus uan 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.110
 the screens are always 3 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.390
 the energy saving widget has changed with we can see everything 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.390
 black in and typical android style uu lol 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.200
 the operating system was designed so as we can see the bar 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.190
 Notifications now run much faster than before 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.710
 and above all a passage from a slave to another is taken much more 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010
 fluid is fast 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.020
 the menu is always the same has not been changed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.400
 scrolling fast enough 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.990
 however, the news is not very happy 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.049
 the camera has been improved 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.299
 how can we see and when are we going to hate her 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.409
 indicates how many seconds - and especially when we're going to take a picture 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.900
 let's try a moment to let you see and use 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 a little less time for you 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.350
 to get ready to take the next share photo 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.390
 in a few moments we had to wait for a new image 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.230
 so let's go to the settings for a moment 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.000
 just to check that the update has taken place 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.149
 correctly here is firmware version 2. 0 1 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.279
 that you have the new release and keep from motorola for his teacher 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.089
 so an update that for the moment I teach to all of you for you too 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.900
 it seems that those who have already updated how many days unofficial way 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.260
 has also achieved an increase in battery life of about 5 10% 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.129
 that never hurts 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.120
 the news and as he said are not so many was however specified 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.630
 the system that made it quite stable 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.040
 and there are no longer those little children who met before 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.620
 new lockscreen and news ends here unfortunately this text changed here 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.380
 no new widgets were found 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.229
 I tried to install 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.959
 the homescreen nexus phone 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.959
 here is the water of the show a second 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:03.109
 it is very nice boat all these effects how to write 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.709
 we have in the menu that flows in three dimensions really very nice to see 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 we have the 5 screens here they are 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.379
 the problem rt when we arrive autocad use the phone horizontally 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.389
 we asked for bang 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.849
 as you can see we can't forget about various screens and if we try to 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.879
 press the side key we have the menu quite messed up then 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.279
 I can't use this again 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.749
 this homescreen set sounds 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:38.629
 unless we are satisfied with our want on that bank of 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.329
 horizontal mode which is quite annoying 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.930
 lyrics here is the news of this update we have closed vi 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.239
 I advise you to follow him for rogues you will find again with phone + little more 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.039
 powerful and more stable 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.939
 and we wait for that engine has released an official update to android e 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:53.830
