for<00:00:04.500> track<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.100> training<00:00:05.520> nutrition

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.490 

there<00:00:14.030> is<00:00:14.120> points<00:00:14.480> in<00:00:14.600> the<00:00:14.960> training<00:00:15.170> where

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
there is points in the training where

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.230 
there is points in the training where
you<00:00:15.650> if<00:00:16.010> you're<00:00:16.250> getting<00:00:16.369> closer<00:00:16.670> to<00:00:16.880> racing

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
you if you're getting closer to racing

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.609 
you if you're getting closer to racing
and<00:00:17.450> you<00:00:17.540> know<00:00:17.750> that<00:00:17.960> you<00:00:18.110> are<00:00:18.230> still<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.500> little

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
and you know that you are still a little

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.260 
and you know that you are still a little
bit<00:00:18.830> heavier<00:00:19.189> than<00:00:19.250> need<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.550> be<00:00:19.670> for<00:00:19.849> racing

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
bit heavier than need to be for racing

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.880 
bit heavier than need to be for racing
so<00:00:20.300> you<00:00:20.480> do<00:00:20.720> have<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:20.990> restrict<00:00:21.560> your<00:00:21.710> calories

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
so you do have to restrict your calories

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.249 
so you do have to restrict your calories
slightly<00:00:22.550> but<00:00:23.270> it's<00:00:23.420> always<00:00:23.599> best<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.020> do<00:00:24.170> it

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
slightly but it's always best to do it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.050 
slightly but it's always best to do it
over<00:00:24.380> give<00:00:24.830> yourself<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.189> long<00:00:25.400> period<00:00:25.820> of<00:00:25.850> time

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
over give yourself a long period of time

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.000 
over give yourself a long period of time
to<00:00:26.270> do<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.539> you<00:00:26.779> don't<00:00:26.960> want<00:00:27.170> to<00:00:27.260> start

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
to do it you don't want to start

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.700 
to do it you don't want to start
restricting<00:00:28.400> your<00:00:28.789> diet<00:00:29.090> by<00:00:29.330> 500<00:00:30.320> calories<00:00:30.680> a

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
restricting your diet by 500 calories a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.920 
restricting your diet by 500 calories a
day<00:00:30.830> it's<00:00:31.160> just<00:00:31.369> important<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.000> me<00:00:32.090> for<00:00:32.809> me

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
day it's just important to me for me

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.660 
day it's just important to me for me
it's<00:00:33.050> just<00:00:33.110> being<00:00:33.410> sensible<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.129> I<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:34.519> ever

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
it's just being sensible and I do ever

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.729 
it's just being sensible and I do ever
speak<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.480> crave<00:00:35.809> like<00:00:36.080> sweets<00:00:36.530> and

speak to if I crave like sweets and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.470 
speak to if I crave like sweets and
chocolate<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.340> we<00:00:37.879> do<00:00:38.030> have<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.239> occasional

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
chocolate and we do have the occasional

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.840 
chocolate and we do have the occasional
takeaway<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:39.199> it's<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:40.250> just<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:40.730> know

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
takeaway so it's it's just you know

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.160 
takeaway so it's it's just you know
having<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.210> be<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.330> little<00:00:41.570> bit<00:00:41.660> more<00:00:41.809> strict

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
having to be a little bit more strict

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.600 
having to be a little bit more strict
just<00:00:42.409> use<00:00:42.559> your<00:00:42.710> willpower<00:00:42.860> for<00:00:43.339> you<00:00:43.489> know

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
just use your willpower for you know

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.890 
just use your willpower for you know
there's<00:00:43.790> those<00:00:44.089> few<00:00:44.360> more<00:00:44.510> weeks<00:00:44.750> before

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
there's those few more weeks before

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.410 
there's those few more weeks before
racing<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.739> I<00:00:45.860> find<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.430> works<00:00:46.760> best<00:00:47.120> but

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
racing and I find that works best but

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.180 
racing and I find that works best but
then<00:00:47.570> it's<00:00:48.019> important<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.530> treat<00:00:48.799> yourself

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
then it's important to treat yourself

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.979 
then it's important to treat yourself
food<00:00:49.400> should<00:00:49.580> be<00:00:49.610> enjoyable<00:00:50.239> as<00:00:50.390> well<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:50.839> in

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
food should be enjoyable as well so in

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.229

even<00:01:54.170> if<00:01:54.260> it's<00:01:54.350> for<00:01:54.470> short<00:01:54.770> rides<00:01:55.010> I'll<00:01:55.160> always

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
even if it's for short rides I'll always

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.520

take spare gels and energy bars with me

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.680 
take spare gels and energy bars with me
because<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.880> days<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.090> don't<00:01:59.330> expect

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
because it's the days you don't expect

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.300 
because it's the days you don't expect
that<00:01:59.960> you'll<00:02:00.140> just<00:02:00.350> get<00:02:00.560> out<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.920> know<00:02:01.040> an

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
that you'll just get out you know an

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.860 
that you'll just get out you know an
hour<00:02:01.460> from<00:02:01.700> home<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.180> you'll<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.480> run<00:02:02.750> out

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
hour from home and you'll just run out

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.020 
hour from home and you'll just run out
of<00:02:02.900> energy<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.650> it's<00:02:04.190> always<00:02:04.340> important<00:02:04.910> just

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
of energy so it's always important just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.880 
of energy so it's always important just
to<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.270> space<00:02:05.570> with<00:02:05.840> youth<00:02:06.050> just<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.500> get<00:02:06.770> you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
session which is normally a run there's

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.500 
session which is normally a run there's
nothing<00:02:12.920> specific<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.520> do<00:02:13.700> beforehand<00:02:14.330> but

nothing specific I do beforehand but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.420 
nothing specific I do beforehand but
after<00:02:14.900> running<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.290> it's<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:15.920> important

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
after running I it's really important

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.280 
after running I it's really important
it's<00:02:16.970> been<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> hard<00:02:17.420> room<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.930> get<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
it's been a hard room to get the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.620 
it's been a hard room to get the
recovery<00:02:18.710> drinks<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.240> make<00:02:20.390> sure<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.330 
recovery drinks in and to make sure you
eat<00:02:20.840> quite<00:02:21.110> soon<00:02:21.350> after<00:02:21.590> running<00:02:21.950> otherwise

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
eat quite soon after running otherwise

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.210 
eat quite soon after running otherwise
you<00:02:22.580> get<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.330> just<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.690> too<00:02:23.900> hungry<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.560> then

you get you just get too hungry and then

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.280 
you get you just get too hungry and then
maybe<00:02:25.820> eat<00:02:26.000> end<00:02:26.240> up<00:02:26.390> eating<00:02:26.510> too<00:02:26.810> much<00:02:26.990> later

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
maybe eat end up eating too much later

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.140 
maybe eat end up eating too much later
so<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.770> important<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> keep<00:02:28.460> your<00:02:28.580> nutrition

training<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.850> then<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.600> go<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.930> bed<00:03:09.170> quite

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
training and then I go to bed quite

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.350 
training and then I go to bed quite
early<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:10.130> are<00:03:10.280> up<00:03:10.489> early<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:11.030> I'll

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
early because we are up early but I'll

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.880 
early because we are up early but I'll
always<00:03:11.570> have<00:03:11.750> some<00:03:12.020> sort<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> dessert<00:03:12.620> or

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
always have some sort of dessert or

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.680 
always have some sort of dessert or
pudding<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.400> quite<00:03:13.820> often<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.239> will<00:03:14.360> end<00:03:14.540> up

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
pudding and quite often that will end up

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.030 
pudding and quite often that will end up
being<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.050> an<00:03:15.200> ends<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.560> are<00:03:15.590> because<00:03:15.950> you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
being like an ends you are because you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.860 
being like an ends you are because you
just<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:17.180> better<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:17.450> you're<00:03:17.570> getting<00:03:17.660> up

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
just it's better if you're getting up

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.210 
just it's better if you're getting up
swimming<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.320> next<00:03:18.500> morning<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:18.920> don't<00:03:19.070> want

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
swimming the next morning you don't want

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.460 
swimming the next morning you don't want
to<00:03:19.280> be<00:03:19.340> going<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.640> bed<00:03:19.790> hungry<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.630> it's<00:03:20.840> just

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
to be going to bed hungry so it's just

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.840 
to be going to bed hungry so it's just
making<00:03:21.830> sure<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.070> never<00:03:22.190> really<00:03:22.489> get<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.670> that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
making sure you never really get to that

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.810 
making sure you never really get to that
really<00:03:23.150> hungry<00:03:23.420> state
