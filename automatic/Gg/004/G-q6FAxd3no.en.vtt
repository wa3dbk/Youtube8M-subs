00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
their only weakness I'd say is their

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
crawford he's a young goalie I mean he

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
crawford he's a young goalie I mean he
might<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> good<00:01:17.280> future<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
might have a good future but right now I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.080 
might have a good future but right now I
just<00:01:19.229> say<00:01:19.740> he's<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.130> average<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.320> mean

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
what I'm talking about but I'm basically

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.240 
what I'm talking about but I'm basically
that<00:02:44.720> whole<00:02:44.900> left<00:02:45.140> side<00:02:45.380> was<00:02:45.560> open<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:46.070> that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
that whole left side was open but that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.370 
that whole left side was open but that
it<00:02:46.370> was<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.670> goalies<00:02:47.060> glove<00:02:47.450> hand<00:02:47.690> side<00:02:47.959> so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it was on the goalies glove hand side so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.600 
it was on the goalies glove hand side so
I<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.620> know<00:02:48.680> why<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.890> didn't<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> glove

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
I don't know why you didn't get a glove

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.390

save<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.570> real<00:02:51.410> life<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.890> think<00:02:51.950> he<00:02:52.280> would

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
save on it in real life I think he would

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.860 
save on it in real life I think he would
have<00:02:52.489> probably<00:02:52.730> had<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.030> really<00:02:53.390> good<00:02:53.630> chance

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
have probably had a really good chance

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.330 
have probably had a really good chance
of<00:02:54.110> saving<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.620> mean<00:02:54.860> no<00:02:55.040> one<00:02:55.070> was

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
of saving that I mean no one was

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.050 
of saving that I mean no one was
screening<00:02:55.700> him<00:02:55.940> or<00:02:56.090> anything<00:02:57.820> when<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:58.910> see

wouldn't<00:05:43.220> have<00:05:43.370> that<00:05:43.490> angle<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.600> basically

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
wouldn't have that angle so basically

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.930 
wouldn't have that angle so basically
makes<00:05:45.410> a<00:05:45.530> crowd<00:05:45.740> look<00:05:45.950> really<00:05:46.220> stupid<00:05:46.460> but<00:05:46.880> I

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940

I do score with a minute two seconds
left<00:05:58.670> so<00:05:58.970> keep<00:05:59.300> your<00:05:59.450> eye<00:05:59.510> on<00:05:59.780> that<00:06:00.020> clock

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
left so keep your eye on that clock

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.320 
left so keep your eye on that clock
right<00:06:00.650> now<00:06:01.250> there's<00:06:01.580> about<00:06:01.820> a<00:06:01.880> little<00:06:02.210> over

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
right now there's about a little over

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.410 
right now there's about a little over
three<00:06:02.690> minutes<00:06:03.640> the<00:06:04.640> last<00:06:04.670> minute<00:06:05.270> though

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
three minutes the last minute though

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
three minutes the last minute though
goes<00:06:06.050> by<00:06:06.260> regular<00:06:06.980> time<00:06:07.370> so<00:06:08.240> like<00:06:08.480> as<00:06:09.050> you<00:06:09.320> guys

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
and if you didn't know the last minute

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.760 
and if you didn't know the last minute
goes<00:06:14.060> by<00:06:14.090> regular<00:06:14.660> time<00:06:14.840> so<00:06:15.080> when<00:06:15.260> gets<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:15.740> a

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
goes by regular time so when gets to a
