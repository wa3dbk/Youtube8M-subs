00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.900 
but I have gone the extra length to go
on<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.450> fix<00:02:16.630> up<00:02:16.840> buildings<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.340> it

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
on and fix up buildings like this and it

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.720 
on and fix up buildings like this and it
makes<00:02:19.300> economic<00:02:19.660> sense<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.920> for<00:02:21.550> no<00:02:21.700> other

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
makes economic sense if for no other

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.020 
makes economic sense if for no other
reason<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.980> building<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.640> structurally

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
reason this building is structurally

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.370 
reason this building is structurally
sound<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.620> roof<00:02:26.890> has<00:02:27.510> decayed<00:02:28.510> tremendously

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
sound the roof has decayed tremendously

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.160 
sound the roof has decayed tremendously
due<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.190> weathering<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.959> taken

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
due to the weathering but I have taken

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.620 
due to the weathering but I have taken
many<00:02:32.620> buildings<00:02:33.190> much<00:02:33.489> worse<00:02:33.760> than<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.300> and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
many buildings much worse than this and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.229 
many buildings much worse than this and
to<00:02:35.500> reproduce<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.140> expensive<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:40.030> would

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
to reproduce it is so expensive it would

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.759 
to reproduce it is so expensive it would
be<00:02:40.420> much<00:02:40.900> more<00:02:41.010> economically<00:02:42.180> sound<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:44.110> fix

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
be much more economically sound to fix

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.220 
be much more economically sound to fix
up<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.430> than<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.299> try<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.570> build<00:02:46.870> something
