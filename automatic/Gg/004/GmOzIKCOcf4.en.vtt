that at last forever it's aluminum yeah
it's<00:00:54.390> light<00:00:54.719> easy<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.770> pull<00:00:55.980> easy<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.210> cool

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it's light easy to pull easy to cool

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
it's light easy to pull easy to cool
down<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> easy<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.649> keep<00:00:58.859> warm<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
down and easy to keep warm if the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.020 
down and easy to keep warm if the
temperature<00:01:00.090> drops<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.670> there's<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.910> many

me a nice guitar a very inexpensively so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.880 
me a nice guitar a very inexpensively so
like<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.130> did<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> inside<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
like we did the inside of it and and it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.270 
like we did the inside of it and and it
was<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.130> easy<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.210> regular

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
was very easy because it's just regular

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.910 
was very easy because it's just regular
you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.310> plywood<00:01:53.880> floor<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:55.290> remodel

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you know plywood floor and we remodel

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
you know plywood floor and we remodel
the<00:01:56.009> inside<00:01:56.369> kitchen<00:01:56.939> stuff<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.570> did

the inside kitchen stuff like that did
you<00:01:58.200> use<00:01:58.380> did<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> buy<00:01:58.979> furniture<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.909> buy

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
you use did you buy furniture and buy
you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.659> pre-made<00:02:01.259> counters<00:02:01.680> would<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you know pre-made counters would you

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.050 
you know pre-made counters would you
have<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> custom<00:02:02.520> build<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
have to custom build a lot of it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.120 
have to custom build a lot of it
custom-built<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> yeah<00:02:04.229> yeah<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:04.979> it's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
custom-built it yeah yeah because it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.499 
custom-built it yeah yeah because it's
easy<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> design<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
easy because of the design of the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.559 
easy because of the design of the
airstream<00:02:06.990> being<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:08.099> nice<00:02:08.340> square<00:02:08.879> right

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
airstream being this nice square right

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.320 
airstream being this nice square right
it's<00:02:10.170> round

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's round

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.150 
it's round
so<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.480> have<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.870> custom<00:02:12.290> design<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.800> pieces

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
so you have to custom design the pieces

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.370 
so you have to custom design the pieces
yeah<00:02:13.490> for<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.850> inside<00:02:14.210> plus<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.960> can<00:02:15.140> change

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
yeah for the inside plus you can change

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.290 
yeah for the inside plus you can change
the<00:02:15.530> layout<00:02:15.710> that's<00:02:16.400> according<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.090> what<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
the layout that's according to what the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.820 
the layout that's according to what the
customer<00:02:17.780> won<00:02:17.990> we<00:02:18.290> wanted<00:02:18.500> something<00:02:18.710> a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
to what you like we did what was the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.570 
to what you like we did what was the
