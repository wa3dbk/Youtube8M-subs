00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.730 

don't<00:00:57.860> know<00:00:58.010> him<00:00:58.510> so<00:00:59.510> what<00:00:59.690> happened<00:00:59.720> is<00:01:00.230> he

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
don't know him so what happened is he

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.100 
don't know him so what happened is he
altered<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.730> middle<00:01:02.060> of<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.240> fight<00:01:02.540> which

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
altered in the middle of the fight which

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.049 
altered in the middle of the fight which
is<00:01:03.320> nothing<00:01:03.710> special<00:01:03.830> because<00:01:04.340> you<00:01:04.640> want<00:01:04.910> that

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
is nothing special because you want that

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.910 
is nothing special because you want that
extra<00:01:05.360> damage<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:06.170> instead<00:01:06.440> of<00:01:06.590> just<00:01:06.800> doing

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
extra damage but instead of just doing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920 
extra damage but instead of just doing
the<00:01:07.340> extra<00:01:07.610> damage<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.300> getting<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.600> one<00:01:08.810> in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
the extra damage and getting a one in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.380 
the extra damage and getting a one in
two<00:01:09.080> chance<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.770> actually<00:01:10.040> being<00:01:10.400> targeted<00:01:10.940> he

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
two chance of actually being targeted he

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.800 
two chance of actually being targeted he
runs<00:01:11.690> out<00:01:12.020> his<00:01:12.530> clone<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.360> therefore<00:01:14.360> xin

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
runs out his clone and therefore xin

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.960 
runs out his clone and therefore xin
zhao<00:01:14.990> gets<00:01:15.410> tricked<00:01:15.770> into<00:01:16.040> thinking<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.640> he

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
zhao gets tricked into thinking that he

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.870 
zhao gets tricked into thinking that he
runs<00:01:17.180> out<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.690> fight<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.880> zingos

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
runs out of the fight and zingos

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.480 
runs out of the fight and zingos
actually<00:01:20.300> after<00:01:20.810> his<00:01:21.080> clone<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.650> therefore

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
actually after his clone and therefore

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.530 
actually after his clone and therefore
he<00:01:22.580> gets<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.910> double<00:01:22.940> kill<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.670> yes<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.240> know<00:01:26.390> a

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
he gets a double kill so yes I know a

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.930 
he gets a double kill so yes I know a
lot<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:26.930> people<00:01:27.050> will<00:01:27.619> just<00:01:27.979> say<00:01:28.280> well<00:01:28.610> they

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
lot of people will just say well they

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.270 
lot of people will just say well they
added<00:01:29.240> standard<00:01:30.020> cheguei<00:01:30.380> play<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.010> it

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
added standard cheguei play but it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.120 
added standard cheguei play but it
really<00:01:31.640> isn't<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.360> as<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:32.869> said<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.350> lot<00:01:33.979> of

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
really isn't and as I said a lot of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.040 
really isn't and as I said a lot of
people<00:01:34.310> can<00:01:34.640> learn<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:35.150> lot<00:01:35.210> from<00:01:35.510> just

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
people can learn a lot from just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.500 
people can learn a lot from just
watching<00:01:36.320> closely<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.280> what<00:01:37.310> other<00:01:37.700> people<00:01:37.970> do

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
watching closely to what other people do

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.170 
watching closely to what other people do
even<00:01:39.410> if<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:39.710> by<00:01:39.830> accident<00:01:40.280> but<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.000> was

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
even if it's by accident but this was

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.160 
even if it's by accident but this was
there<00:01:41.390> definitely<00:01:41.720> not<00:01:42.320> an<00:01:42.500> accident<00:01:43.130> he<00:01:44.170> well

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
there definitely not an accident he well

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.230 
there definitely not an accident he well
he<00:01:45.500> may<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.710> does<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.369> all<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.610> time<00:01:46.729> but

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
he may be does this all the time but

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.150 
he may be does this all the time but
this<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:47.900> something<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.619> lot<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.920> people

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
this is something that a lot of people

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.760 
this is something that a lot of people
can<00:01:49.460> learn<00:01:49.610> from<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.380> really<00:01:51.560> nice

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
