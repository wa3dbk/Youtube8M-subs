00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
also so it makes my eyes look a little

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.929 
also so it makes my eyes look a little
bit<00:04:11.590> bigger<00:04:11.769> than<00:04:12.040> they<00:04:12.129> really<00:04:12.159> are

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
bit bigger than they really are

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.099 
bit bigger than they really are
and<00:04:13.359> hopefully<00:04:14.939> feels<00:04:15.939> like<00:04:16.120> spring<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:16.810> I

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
and hopefully feels like spring so I

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.930 
and hopefully feels like spring so I
think<00:04:17.169> I'm<00:04:17.620> done<00:04:17.889> with<00:04:18.039> that<00:04:18.190> I'm<00:04:18.459> gonna<00:04:18.669> move

on to my eyeliner now so it's black
powdered<00:04:23.020> wasn't<00:04:23.560> expecting<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.009> either<00:04:24.370> so

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
powdered wasn't expecting that either so

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
powdered wasn't expecting that either so
I'm<00:04:24.940> not<00:04:25.030> gonna<00:04:25.150> even<00:04:25.300> count<00:04:25.539> those<00:04:25.630> as<00:04:25.750> my

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900

I'm not gonna even count those as my
products<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.440> I'm<00:04:26.530> gonna<00:04:26.680> use<00:04:26.860> some<00:04:26.889> water<00:04:27.220> to

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
mix in with that powder so we can create

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.460 
mix in with that powder so we can create
some<00:04:30.580> sort<00:04:30.759> of<00:04:30.849> like<00:04:31.030> eyeliner<00:04:31.599> liquid<00:04:31.990> thing

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
they're supposed to be sisters

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.100 
they're supposed to be sisters
apparently<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.479> think<00:05:31.659> that's<00:05:31.779> eyebrows

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
apparently I think that's eyebrows

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.479 
apparently I think that's eyebrows
eyebrows<00:05:32.919> are<00:05:33.099> supposed<00:05:33.279> to<00:05:33.339> look<00:05:33.429> like

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:33.489 
eyebrows are supposed to look like

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:36.209 
eyebrows are supposed to look like
sisters<00:05:33.969> but<00:05:34.839> I'm<00:05:35.199> gonna<00:05:35.409> say<00:05:35.709> that<00:05:35.919> about

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
sisters but I'm gonna say that about

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.369 
sisters but I'm gonna say that about
liquid<00:05:36.519> eyeliner<00:05:36.879> also<00:05:37.149> cuz<00:05:37.569> I<00:05:37.809> can<00:05:38.079> never<00:05:38.199> get

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:38.379 
liquid eyeliner also cuz I can never get

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.179 
liquid eyeliner also cuz I can never get
this<00:05:38.709> one

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
this one

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.169 
this one
so<00:05:39.849> I<00:05:40.239> think<00:05:40.360> we're<00:05:40.659> almost<00:05:40.779> done<00:05:41.050> with<00:05:41.079> the

just realized I have black powder all

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.120 
just realized I have black powder all
over<00:06:19.710> my<00:06:20.040> face<00:06:20.370> but<00:06:22.400> it's<00:06:23.400> okay<00:06:24.020> okay<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.440> the

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
over my face but it's okay okay and the

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.320 
over my face but it's okay okay and the
last<00:06:26.340> thing<00:06:26.520> we're<00:06:26.640> gonna<00:06:26.730> do<00:06:26.880> is<00:06:27.000> put<00:06:27.180> some

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
last thing we're gonna do is put some

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.000 
last thing we're gonna do is put some
lipstick<00:06:27.690> on<00:06:27.870> and<00:06:28.200> this<00:06:28.380> is<00:06:28.560> like<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.710> really

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
lipstick on and this is like a really

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.810 
lipstick on and this is like a really
coral<00:06:29.460> color

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
coral color

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:37.090 
coral color
it's<00:06:30.240> called<00:06:30.740> 15<00:06:31.740> minutes<00:06:32.100> of<00:06:32.280> flame<00:06:32.550> so

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.950 

always<00:06:38.100> moisturize<00:06:38.760> before<00:06:39.270> putting<00:06:39.720> on

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
always moisturize before putting on

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.410 
always moisturize before putting on
lipstick<00:06:40.440> but<00:06:40.830> I<00:06:41.190> don't<00:06:42.120> have<00:06:42.240> any

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
lipstick but I don't have any

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:50.800 
lipstick but I don't have any
moisturizer<00:06:42.780> on<00:06:43.110> me<00:06:43.260> and<00:06:44.040> I<00:06:47.120> think<00:06:48.620> that's<00:06:49.620> it

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
moisturizer on me and I think that's it

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.360 
moisturizer on me and I think that's it
so<00:06:51.810> it's<00:06:51.930> seven<00:06:52.200> minutes<00:06:52.290> later<00:06:52.680> this<00:06:52.860> is<00:06:53.010> kind

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
so it's seven minutes later this is kind

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.590 
so it's seven minutes later this is kind
of<00:06:53.400> my<00:06:53.520> look<00:06:53.780> I<00:06:55.610> think<00:06:56.610> with<00:06:56.970> just<00:06:57.300> seven

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
of my look I think with just seven

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.910 
of my look I think with just seven
minutes<00:06:57.840> on<00:06:57.930> the<00:06:57.990> clock<00:06:58.110> I<00:06:58.260> did<00:06:58.410> pretty<00:06:58.800> good

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
minutes on the clock I did pretty good

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.800 
minutes on the clock I did pretty good
if<00:06:59.310> I<00:06:59.550> had<00:06:59.730> to<00:06:59.820> change<00:07:00.090> anything<00:07:00.360> I<00:07:00.660> would

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
if I had to change anything I would

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.930 
if I had to change anything I would
change<00:07:01.050> grabbing<00:07:01.890> this<00:07:02.040> powder<00:07:02.310> cuz<00:07:02.640> I'm<00:07:02.760> sure

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
change grabbing this powder cuz I'm sure

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.070 
change grabbing this powder cuz I'm sure
I<00:07:02.970> could<00:07:03.210> have<00:07:03.300> grabbed<00:07:03.480> something<00:07:03.720> cooler

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
I could have grabbed something cooler

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.080 
I could have grabbed something cooler
but<00:07:04.770> other<00:07:04.950> than<00:07:05.070> that<00:07:05.220> I<00:07:05.490> really<00:07:05.790> like<00:07:05.940> the

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
but other than that I really like the

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.270 
but other than that I really like the
black<00:07:06.240> color<00:07:06.480> I<00:07:06.690> chose<00:07:06.900> for<00:07:07.140> myself<00:07:07.290> and<00:07:07.830> the

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
black color I chose for myself and the

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.300 
black color I chose for myself and the
idea<00:07:08.640> of<00:07:08.820> using<00:07:09.000> a<00:07:09.270> highlighter<00:07:09.690> to<00:07:10.290> like<00:07:10.440> make

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
idea of using a highlighter to like make

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.220 
idea of using a highlighter to like make
your<00:07:11.460> face<00:07:11.670> with<00:07:11.880> all<00:07:11.970> glowy<00:07:12.270> for<00:07:12.630> spring<00:07:12.990> is

really<00:07:13.440> in<00:07:13.800> and<00:07:14.190> I<00:07:14.550> think<00:07:14.790> that<00:07:14.910> was<00:07:15.060> probably

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210
