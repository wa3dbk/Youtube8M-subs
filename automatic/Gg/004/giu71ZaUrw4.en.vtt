this to recreate the patient's brain we

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.710 
this to recreate the patient's brain we
then<00:04:16.530> actually<00:04:16.980> program<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.820> computer<00:04:18.180> which

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
then actually program a computer which

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.860 
then actually program a computer which
will<00:04:18.900> direct<00:04:19.430> radiation<00:04:20.430> beams<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.480> various

will direct radiation beams in various

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
directions into the patient's head so as

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.480 
directions into the patient's head so as
to<00:04:24.780> actually<00:04:25.200> destroy<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.830> patient's<00:04:26.280> brain

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
to actually destroy the patient's brain

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.790 
to actually destroy the patient's brain

that so that it will not bleed and cause

that so that it will not bleed and cause
problems<00:04:31.140> in<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.950> future<00:04:33.140> these<00:04:34.140> are<00:04:34.850> virtual

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
problems in the future these are virtual

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.310 
problems in the future these are virtual
reality<00:04:36.180> interfaces<00:04:36.720> which<00:04:36.870> are<00:04:37.050> being

reality interfaces which are being

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.920 
reality interfaces which are being
applied<00:04:37.650> today<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:38.340> lot<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.210> research<00:04:39.630> is<00:04:39.780> going

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
applied today a lot of research is going

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.410 
applied today a lot of research is going
into<00:04:40.290> improving<00:04:40.680> these<00:04:40.890> interfaces<00:04:41.370> in<00:04:41.850> the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
into improving these interfaces in the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.510 
into improving these interfaces in the
future<00:04:42.780> we<00:04:42.960> expect<00:04:43.440> there<00:04:43.650> will<00:04:43.800> be<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.040> true

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
future we expect there will be a true

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.400 
future we expect there will be a true
immersive<00:04:45.210> virtual<00:04:45.570> reality<00:04:45.630> interface

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410

immersive virtual reality interface
available<00:04:46.980> for<00:04:47.160> doctors<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.450> we<00:04:48.600> can

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
available for doctors so that we can

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.140 
available for doctors so that we can
immerse<00:04:49.470> ourselves<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.250> virtual<00:04:50.640> patient

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
immerse ourselves in a virtual patient

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.330 
immerse ourselves in a virtual patient
actually<00:04:51.720> traveled<00:04:52.500> throughout<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.040> human

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
actually traveled throughout the human

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.840 
actually traveled throughout the human
body<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:54.030> then<00:04:54.480> decide<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.200> customize

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
body and then decide and customize

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.100

treatments<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:56.910> will<00:04:57.150> be<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.540> benefit<00:04:58.050> to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
treatments that will be of benefit to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.290 
treatments that will be of benefit to
that<00:04:58.230> patient<00:04:58.560> without<00:04:58.860> even<00:04:59.340> having<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.730> do

that patient without even having to do

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.880 
that patient without even having to do
an<00:05:00.450> operation<00:05:00.810> will<00:05:01.080> actually<00:05:01.350> open<00:05:01.380> up<00:05:01.740> that

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
an operation will actually open up that
