hey what's up guys today I'm doing a

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.840 
hey what's up guys today I'm doing a
video<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.850> PLL's<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.780> use<00:00:04.049> if<00:00:04.400> you<00:00:05.400> use<00:00:05.640> any

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
video on the PLL's I use if you use any

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.519 
video on the PLL's I use if you use any
different<00:00:06.089> ones<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.480> me<00:00:06.720> feel<00:00:07.080> free<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.290> leave

a<00:00:10.710> warning<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.429> video<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:11.849> not<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> tutorial

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
a warning this video is not a tutorial

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.120 
a warning this video is not a tutorial
on<00:00:13.500> PLL's

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
on PLL's

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.640 
on PLL's
it<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.610> simply<00:00:14.969> me<00:00:15.240> showing<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:15.990> PLL's<00:00:16.470> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
it is simply me showing you what PLL's I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.540 
it is simply me showing you what PLL's I
use<00:00:17.449> so<00:00:18.529> without<00:00:19.529> further<00:00:19.770> ado<00:00:20.189> let's<00:00:20.430> just

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
use so without further ado let's just

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.500 
use so without further ado let's just
get<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:20.910> into<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.750> plls<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
get right into the plls I use for the a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
get right into the plls I use for the a
a<00:00:25.320> perm<00:00:26.330> which<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.779> clockwise<00:00:28.560> rotation

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
a perm which is the clockwise rotation

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.200 
a perm which is the clockwise rotation
of<00:00:29.580> these<00:00:29.849> three<00:00:30.210> corners<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.130> out

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.180 

so<00:00:39.210> again<00:00:40.969> for<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.390> B<00:00:43.050> perm<00:00:43.410> which<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so again for the a B perm which is a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.479 
so again for the a B perm which is a
counterclockwise<00:00:45.770> rotation<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.160> three

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
counterclockwise rotation of these three

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.130 
counterclockwise rotation of these three
corners<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.770> use<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.190> again<00:00:56.460> for

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
corners I use this out so just again for

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.709 
corners I use this out so just again for
the<00:00:58.140> EEPROM<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> switching<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the EEPROM which is the switching of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:11.359 
the EEPROM which is the switching of
these<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:01.980> two<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:03.049> use<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.739> L<00:01:10.369> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
these two and these two I use this L so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.929 
these two and these two I use this L so
just<00:01:11.640> again<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:15.060> U<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> perm<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> are

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
just again for the U a perm you are

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.719 
just again for the U a perm you are
switching<00:01:19.250> these<00:01:20.250> three<00:01:21.080> edges<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.670> they<00:01:23.670> are

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
switching these three edges and they are

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.080 
switching these three edges and they are
going<00:01:24.090> counterclockwise<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.430> alga<00:01:26.850> use

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
going counterclockwise and the alga use

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
going counterclockwise and the alga use
for<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:31.070> just<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> bit<00:01:32.310> faster<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.619> then

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
for this is just a bit faster and then

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
for this is just a bit faster and then
for<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> reverse<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> which<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
for the reverse of that which is the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.200 
for the reverse of that which is the
clockwise<00:01:37.049> rotation<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.040> these<00:01:38.610> three<00:01:39.030> edges

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
clockwise rotation of these three edges

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.340 
clockwise rotation of these three edges
I<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.560> al

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.749 

just<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.220> little<00:01:48.460> faster<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> h<00:01:50.950> perm<00:01:51.460> or

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
just a little faster for the h perm or

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.020 
just a little faster for the h perm or
the<00:01:52.659> switching<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.290> two<00:01:53.890> edges<00:01:54.640> across

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
the switching of the two edges across

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.249 
the switching of the two edges across
from<00:01:55.390> each<00:01:55.450> other<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.960> use<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:56.979> al<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:02.020> this

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
from each other I use this al then this

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.999 
from each other I use this al then this
al<00:02:02.439> just<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.830> little<00:02:03.040> bit<00:02:03.159> faster<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:05.009> similarly

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
al just a little bit faster is similarly

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.279 
al just a little bit faster is similarly
with<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.640> Z<00:02:06.850> perm<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.390> switch<00:02:07.600> these<00:02:07.990> two

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
with the Z perm you switch these two

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.420 
with the Z perm you switch these two
edges<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.830> these<00:02:09.190> two<00:02:09.459> edges<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:12.190> al

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
edges and these two edges and this al

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.960 
edges and these two edges and this al
goes<00:02:12.819> like<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.250> same<00:02:21.519> al<00:02:21.760> go

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
goes like this and then that same al go

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.470 
goes like this and then that same al go
a<00:02:22.000> little<00:02:22.090> faster

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.319 

similarly<00:02:28.480> with<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.930> JB<00:02:29.379> perm<00:02:30.180> switching<00:02:31.180> of

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
similarly with the JB perm switching of

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.460 
similarly with the JB perm switching of
these<00:02:31.569> two<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.230> these<00:02:32.530> two<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:33.189> use<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.420> al

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.830 

and<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.629> same<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.110> little<00:02:41.769> bit<00:02:41.890> faster

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
and then that same a little bit faster

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.800 
and then that same a little bit faster
for<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.079> T<00:02:44.560> perm<00:02:44.920> or<00:02:45.159> the<00:02:45.909> switching<00:02:46.359> of<00:02:46.540> these

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
for the T perm or the switching of these

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.280 
for the T perm or the switching of these
two<00:02:47.109> corners<00:02:47.439> and<00:02:47.799> these<00:02:48.340> two<00:02:48.760> edges<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.510> use

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
two corners and these two edges I use

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:03.750 
two corners and these two edges I use
this<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:58.720> faster<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.940> RB<00:03:01.980> case<00:03:02.980> we

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
this a little faster for the RB case we

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.569 
this a little faster for the RB case we
switch<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.150> these<00:03:04.329> two<00:03:04.599> edges<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.250> these<00:03:06.250> two

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
switch to these two edges and these two

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:17.099 
switch to these two edges and these two
corners<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:08.139> a<00:03:08.170> looks<00:03:08.739> like<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:16.019> just<00:03:17.019> a

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
corners and the a looks like this just a

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.830 
corners and the a looks like this just a
little<00:03:17.319> faster<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.799> RA<00:03:21.040> case<00:03:21.819> which<00:03:22.629> is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
little faster for the RA case which is

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.860 
little faster for the RA case which is
the<00:03:22.989> switching<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.500> these<00:03:23.980> two<00:03:24.370> edges<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
the switching of these two edges and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:35.629 
the switching of these two edges and
these<00:03:26.260> two<00:03:26.590> corners<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.340> use<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.269> al

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.640 

this<00:03:36.639> is<00:03:36.819> probably<00:03:37.329> my<00:03:37.629> least<00:03:37.900> favorite<00:03:38.410> case

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
this is probably my least favorite case

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.289 
this is probably my least favorite case
and<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.160> really<00:03:39.459> can't<00:03:39.730> perform<00:03:39.849> it<00:03:40.150> very

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
and I really can't perform it very

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.689 
and I really can't perform it very
quickly<00:03:40.569> so<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.260> might<00:03:41.620> learn<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:41.889> new<00:03:42.160> alec<00:03:42.519> for

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
quickly so I might learn a new alec for

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.119 
quickly so I might learn a new alec for
this<00:03:42.879> but<00:03:43.569> here<00:03:44.199> it<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.379> just<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.739> little<00:03:44.889> bit

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
this but here it is just a little bit

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.039 
this but here it is just a little bit
quickly<00:03:46.949> for<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:48.129> F<00:03:48.370> prime<00:03:49.019> which<00:03:50.019> is

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
quickly for the F prime which is

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.099 
quickly for the F prime which is
switching<00:03:50.590> these<00:03:50.889> two<00:03:51.310> edges<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:52.359> these<00:03:52.810> two

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
switching these two edges and these two

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.180 
switching these two edges and these two
corners<00:03:53.409> I<00:03:53.799> use<00:03:54.489> this<00:03:55.049> version<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.650> t<00:03:56.919> perm

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
corners I use this version of a t perm

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:07.880 
corners I use this version of a t perm
sort<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.139> looks<00:03:59.319> like<00:03:59.530> this

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.010 

and<00:04:09.060> then<00:04:10.060> here's<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.390> alga<00:04:10.840> bit<00:04:11.020> quicker<00:04:13.020> so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
and then here's the alga bit quicker so

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.110 
and then here's the alga bit quicker so
for<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.440> G<00:04:14.650> perms<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.250> already<00:04:15.580> have<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.760> video

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
for the G perms I already have a video

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.880 
for the G perms I already have a video
on<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:16.959> it'd<00:04:17.080> be<00:04:17.170> kind<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.500> waste<00:04:17.650> of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
on that so it'd be kind of a waste of

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.009 
on that so it'd be kind of a waste of
time<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.190> make<00:04:18.310> another<00:04:18.459> one<00:04:18.850> so<00:04:19.030> I'm<00:04:19.750> going<00:04:19.989> to

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
time to make another one so I'm going to

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.539 
time to make another one so I'm going to
leave<00:04:20.230> an<00:04:20.350> annotation<00:04:20.620> right<00:04:20.890> here<00:04:21.280> on<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
leave an annotation right here on the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.370 
leave an annotation right here on the
cube<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.300> click<00:04:22.600> it<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.900> want<00:04:23.170> to<00:04:23.230> check

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
cube just click it if you want to check

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.170 
cube just click it if you want to check
out<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.710> G<00:04:23.860> perms<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.310> use<00:04:24.630> for<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.780> V<00:04:26.170> perm<00:04:26.470> or

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
out the G perms I use for the V perm or

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.690 
out the G perms I use for the V perm or
the<00:04:28.180> counterclockwise<00:04:29.080> rotation<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.250> these

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
the counterclockwise rotation of these

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.650 
the counterclockwise rotation of these
three<00:04:31.210> corners<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.520> swap<00:04:33.820> swapping<00:04:34.300> of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
three corners and the swap swapping of

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:45.380 
three corners and the swap swapping of
these<00:04:35.170> two<00:04:35.560> edges<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.450> use<00:04:37.450> this<00:04:37.720> al

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.630 

here<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.600> just<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.900> bit<00:04:47.050> quicker<00:04:50.190> for<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.400> n

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
here it is just a bit quicker for the n

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.810 
here it is just a bit quicker for the n
B<00:04:52.390> perm<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.440> swapping<00:04:53.710> of<00:04:54.070> these<00:04:54.490> two

corners and these two edges

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:09.090 
corners and these two edges
I<00:04:58.000> use<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:59.170> out<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:07.380> then<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.530> alb<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:09.010> a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
I use this out and then the alb just a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.020 
I use this out and then the alb just a
bit<00:05:09.250> quicker<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:11.220> then<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.400> reverse<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.970> that

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
bit quicker and then the reverse of that

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.830 
bit quicker and then the reverse of that
or<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.780> end<00:05:14.020> a<00:05:14.380> perm<00:05:14.970> which<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.150> switching

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
or the end a perm which is switching

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.190 
or the end a perm which is switching
these<00:05:17.260> two<00:05:17.680> edges<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.310> these<00:05:19.120> two<00:05:19.419> corners<00:05:19.750> I

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
these two edges and these two corners I

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:34.110 
these two edges and these two corners I
use<00:05:21.040> this<00:05:21.520> al<00:05:29.400> alga<00:05:30.400> bit<00:05:30.580> quicker<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:33.120> then

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
use this al alga bit quicker and then

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.740 
use this al alga bit quicker and then
lastly<00:05:34.720> for<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.500> wiper<00:05:36.310> which<00:05:37.210> which<00:05:37.570> is

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
lastly for the wiper which which is

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.860 
lastly for the wiper which which is
these<00:05:38.169> two<00:05:38.500> corners<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.190> these<00:05:39.940> two<00:05:40.210> edges<00:05:40.419> I

these two corners and these two edges I

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:50.379 
these two corners and these two edges I
use<00:05:41.590> this<00:05:41.860> out

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.579 

and<00:05:51.469> then<00:05:52.469> just<00:05:52.739> the<00:05:52.830> algobit<00:05:53.189> quicker<00:05:54.589> so

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:55.589 
and then just the algobit quicker so

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.129 
and then just the algobit quicker so
that<00:05:55.619> is<00:05:55.919> all<00:05:56.129> for<00:05:56.159> my<00:05:56.519> video<00:05:56.669> on<00:05:57.119> the<00:05:57.299> PLL's<00:05:57.869> I

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
that is all for my video on the PLL's I
