00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 Hey everyone, I spoke today and today. 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.830
 I'm back bringing a gameplay to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.110
 you 11 thousand hab 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.380
 Today Sunday already coming across this video 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.039
 on Sunday I took this property in bakara 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.350
 game in which the chicken and for me that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.559
 It was time to enjoy catching him. 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.730
 because as few people know the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.580
 People who follow me on Twitter 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.540
 generally complains that playing this game 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.390
 game without part is horrible only falls contini 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.070
 team pork can not do anything 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.980
 You usually end up having to play. 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.129
 alone is to support these 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.050
 things and in this game play 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.170
 in particular I was alone not 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.899
 I was with nowhere and I usually 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 does not play hurry I like to play the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 assault to catch gameplay with enough 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.810
 kills so I said I'm going to give a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.149

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.360

 I started to play can be can repair 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.180
 in the beginning and in the fight was playing 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.160
 for the goal taking dog tag of everything 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.130
 was not playing as ab 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.080
 after I got the specialist who 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.140
 I spoke to a resident on the call. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.700
 with the boys of the clan and I said 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.500

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.540

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.180
 Wait, do not talk, fucking died, and such. 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.000
 luckily I gotta get it I edited this one 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.580
 game play that in the beginning had two deaths 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 fools then just hit them 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.390
 after I started I found promob but it is 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.460
 that way I know it's not the most 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.190
 cute if you want to see gameplay of 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.950
 moby goes on the channel of the digan and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.350
 Gustavo Gamer liked this game is an open the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.030
 score there takes a very massive way 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.830
 I'll leave his channel in the description 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.960
 leave the little diguinho too but with certainty 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.060
 most of you know say it 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.120
 but Gustavo maybe someday some of 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.490
 you do not know he 's a model kid 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.590
 God damn good friends, my friend. 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.310
 There's no time here for me to 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.770
 this video such that I'm very into one 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.160
 Editing issue with sony photoshop 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.370
 vegas so much that I only do things 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.680
 very basic and I do not know if you 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.670
 they also noticed soon after the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.440
 beginning of the type 1 video that had the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.930
 I had to edit because the host 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.270
 is migrated and I was not recording in the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.350
 So I went on the shoot and recorded the 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:23.320
 two parts understood then to give through 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.770
 I think it's there on the one-minute route 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.900
 that it must be approved and the 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.280
 I edited it was not very bizarre it was not 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.910
 Until what, and for what? 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 attached to my series 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.170
 competitive in the channel has a lot of time 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.630
 which I can not do I think two 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.310
 weeks I still have to do go 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.870
 finish making all the maps I'll go 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.440
 I'll give it to you guys but I can not 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.540
 is to give a given and exact dates to you 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.650
 I'm very, very busy. 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.200
 with the job 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.210
 so I do not get home sometimes I 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.540
 I have to help in training with the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.710
 brats and everything and time to record 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.890
 a cool video 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.870
 Like I have to still tone the 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.460
 goal is to make an arcade object and 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.530
 then comes the rest of all maps 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.560
 I intend to make one of luck and 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:16.090
 Destroy it too but it will be more pro. 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.890
 for the future and I will try or within the 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.730
 reach to bring these videos to you 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.290
 And gameplay is getting around here. 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.490
 I think you're already at the very end if I 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:32.080
 the final cut on this map was 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.910
 40/11 nothing great, but I could not 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.710
 win I get a neighbor
