00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.529
 the dog speaks 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:18.529
 I know your mother died. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.630
 the important thing is yours at 0 today Sunday 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 giving life because the ad has time 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 many things is not very much my line 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 in Tokyo I 'm just straight and I'm not from rec 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.460
 essentially the goal touched his subject 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 opinion several styles there has a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.399
 hockey that separates the territory 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 in tokyo little rep at parties I 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.100
 make more risk Brazilian funk 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.949
 research work but scrolls of the event 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.109
 the big event depending on the house 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.719
 even makes room for a track o 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.110
 But that's one thing this is a 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.150
 thing that I did when I was younger 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:13.710
 to play make river try 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.650
 manipulate pickup is to create the looks bits 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.110
 this whole correct universe thing is that 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 I just have tried thing led me to the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.200
 other side with the professional 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 professionally and with the opportunity 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 to remember and those discs that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.350
 times do not spin a time things I saw 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.210
 when I was in my twenties 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.090
 So it 's an exchange it's an exchange of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 and it's not cool anymore. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.270
 encouragement side of this guy uploads a video 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.860
 There was this song for me since I know 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 when is vinyl appears in these things 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.920
 I want an exchange of experience 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.470
 generate south 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.750
 nowadays everybody is looking for I know 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.479
 I do not have a very sure notion. 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.630
 It's late rap, I just do not have much. 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.329
 school was in the 90's on the needle 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.250
 It's that whole thing was when I 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.780
 I started to like this today but I like it 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.519
 a lot of old school stuff like that 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 like to study to use a song 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.310
 at times that millions of people have been 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.760
 sometimes has a strong slap in the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.610
 staff that todayadays 28 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.569
 of today use the saints refers to the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.760
 lights 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.849
 I think it's an opportunity to be able to 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.299
 and there is also the issue of 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.880
 Beats from the very cool battles 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.130
 Vinyl can make do with older 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.380
 bases some new something thomas 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.250
 basically with repertory was random 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.480
 that I was joining at the time I was 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.120
 involved 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.630
 Then today I 'm listening again through 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.849
 another generation and who gather pleasure 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.130
 doing is remembering study 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.130
 jorge personal perception out 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 I like it because it 's vinyl that has a 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.620
 weight not only 100 level and katja more 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.719
 I think that regardless of this there is a pact 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.000
 Can you change a legal idea to have a 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.310
 independent communication is ringing 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.819
 something that is very strong for everyone 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.450
 counted on a rational disk or thing 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.040
 like this 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.620
 the same playing the thing plus side b 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.049
 taking middle- level instruments in the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.069
 battle picking up things I think bigger 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.900
 from b 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.719
 I do not think there's much in these days. 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.299
 I do not see it is different 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:44.849
 before I did not like rap on the line. 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.269
 soul is a galera I want to like bc 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.889
 it was from other people, not me today 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.019
 always I heard a lot of music think 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:56.099
 days are more open to the same chance 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:01.799
 of listening to try to mix everything mix 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:03.900
 to the old man a lot of experience and 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.169
 godard is with respect to what is the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.969
 story of the whole thing is work 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.989
 work offset edition then it's more or 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:15.180
 least this is to present the sound is more or 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.579
 less than pretentiously one side of the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.639
 The story of the thing pulls the 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.710
 various times and tried to express and 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.470
 show what I understand about what the 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.270
 synthesized in those years there is the sound that I 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.949
 I basically do what I'm going to look for 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.949
 back up little 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.830
