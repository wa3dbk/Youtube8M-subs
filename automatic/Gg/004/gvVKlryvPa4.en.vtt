00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.799 
of 2008
I<00:00:42.149> think<00:00:42.930> twas<00:00:43.110> around<00:00:43.350> between<00:00:44.239> 57<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.329> 60<00:00:45.719> at

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I think twas around between 57 and 60 at

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
I think twas around between 57 and 60 at
that<00:00:45.960> stage<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.530> stage<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that stage this stage know which it is

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.630 
that stage this stage know which it is
they're<00:00:47.940> 75<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.750> calf<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> common<00:00:50.520> winter

we'll<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:52.620> probably<00:00:52.949> buy<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
we'll say and we probably buy in a

we'll say and we probably buy in a
literate<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.239> have

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
literate in there and that just have

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
literate in there and that just have
ended<00:00:54.690> after<00:00:54.780> only<00:00:55.110> 85<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.649> next<00:00:55.829> year<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.100> we

originally<00:01:07.950> were<00:01:08.310> using<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.760> suppose<00:01:09.000> were

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
originally were using I suppose were

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.039 
originally were using I suppose were
semental<00:01:09.689> from<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> dairy<00:01:10.710> herd<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:12.049> they

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
semental from the dairy herd and they

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
semental from the dairy herd and they
were<00:01:13.140> produced<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> very<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:13.920> roti<00:01:14.159> calf

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
were produced in a very good roti calf

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.969 
were produced in a very good roti calf
our<00:01:14.670> race<00:01:14.960> then<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.080> started<00:01:16.560> crossing<00:01:16.770> them

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
our race then we started crossing them

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
our race then we started crossing them
with<00:01:17.130> limousine<00:01:17.549> got<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.240> even<00:01:18.479> better<00:01:18.600> calf

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
with limousine got an even better calf

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.590 
with limousine got an even better calf
and<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.700> time<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.909> started<00:01:21.240> using

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and so that time we started using

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.190 
and so that time we started using
maternal<00:01:22.290> limousines<00:01:22.680> under<00:01:23.009> semental<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
maternal limousines under semental and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.510 
maternal limousines under semental and
it's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> sort<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> crisscross<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.310> between

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it's a sort of a crisscross then between

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's a sort of a crisscross then between
the<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.000> after<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> know

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the two then after that like you know

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.039 
the two then after that like you know
limousine<00:01:28.170> semental<00:01:29.509> trying<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> keep<00:01:30.720> making

springtime we say if we're trying to get
cows<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:47.220> only<00:01:47.340> certain<00:01:47.520> feeds<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
cows out there's only certain feeds that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.490 
cows out there's only certain feeds that
you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.270> let<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.850> could

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
you can let them out you say you could

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
you can let them out you say you could
you'd<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.619> graze<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.040> fields<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you'd be graze in the fields like you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.370 
you'd be graze in the fields like you
would<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.540> motor<00:01:54.720> house<00:01:54.960> coming<00:01:55.259> over

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
would have that motor house coming over

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.600 
would have that motor house coming over
on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> money<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.860> keep<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> numbers<00:01:56.399> lower

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
on the money we keep the numbers lower

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.370 
on the money we keep the numbers lower
therefore<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.329> force<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> first<00:01:58.110> graze

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
therefore the force for the first graze

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
therefore the force for the first graze
and<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.310> even<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.700> we'd<00:01:59.909> say<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.060> could

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and and even at that we'd say you could

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.399 
and and even at that we'd say you could
have<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> take<00:02:00.540> him<00:02:00.659> off<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> before<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.320> be

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have to take him off it before it be

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.569 
have to take him off it before it be
finished<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.070> would<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.189> certain

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
finished because there would be certain

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.170

couple of weeks there for growth and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.240 
couple of weeks there for growth and
that's<00:04:37.050> why<00:04:37.199> we're<00:04:37.379> taking<00:04:37.500> out<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.919> purposes
