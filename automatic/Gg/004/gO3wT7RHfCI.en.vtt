00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.370 
there's a lot of exclusivity going on
and<00:01:59.959> for<00:02:00.889> that<00:02:01.009> reason<00:02:01.069> i<00:02:01.579> think<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
and for that reason i think that the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.069 
and for that reason i think that the
marriage<00:02:03.740> between<00:02:03.889> EA<00:02:04.340> sports<00:02:04.849> and<00:02:05.090> NFL<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.049> a

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
marriage between EA sports and NFL is a

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.080 
marriage between EA sports and NFL is a
happy<00:02:06.529> one<00:02:06.679> I<00:02:06.919> don't<00:02:07.490> really<00:02:07.639> see<00:02:07.759> anything

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
happy one I don't really see anything

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.600 
happy one I don't really see anything
disrupting<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:08.959> at<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.200> moment<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:09.800> don't

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
disrupting that at the moment I don't

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.790 
disrupting that at the moment I don't
really<00:02:10.789> see<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.540> know<00:02:11.660> what<00:02:12.440> would<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.590> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
really see you know what would be the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.089 
really see you know what would be the
big<00:02:12.980> piece<00:02:13.250> or<00:02:13.580> what<00:02:14.480> element<00:02:15.050> will<00:02:15.410> come<00:02:15.920> into

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
big piece or what element will come into

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.130 
big piece or what element will come into
play<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.430> will<00:02:17.060> make<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.299> NFL<00:02:17.750> think<00:02:18.019> they

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
play that will make the NFL think they

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.770 
play that will make the NFL think they
need<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.349> open<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:18.860> up<00:02:18.980> again

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
need to open it up again

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.140 
need to open it up again
that's<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.620> how<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.830> feel<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.730> know<00:02:21.760> we<00:02:22.000> all

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that's just how I feel you know we all

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.910 
that's just how I feel you know we all
know<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> few<00:02:22.660> years<00:02:22.720> back<00:02:23.170> there<00:02:23.680> was<00:02:23.800> an

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
know a few years back there was an

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.949 
know a few years back there was an
opportunity<00:02:24.010> there<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:25.060> relinquish<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
opportunity there to relinquish the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.440 
opportunity there to relinquish the
license<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.800> open<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.220> up<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.550> market<00:02:27.970> but

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
license and open it up to the market but

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.010 
license and open it up to the market but
they<00:02:28.569> didn't<00:02:28.959> they<00:02:29.920> re-sign<00:02:30.610> all<00:02:30.790> da<00:02:30.940> sport<00:02:31.390> so

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
they didn't they re-sign all da sport so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.280 
they didn't they re-sign all da sport so
I<00:02:32.080> just<00:02:32.290> think<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.520> know<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.260> type<00:02:35.260> of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
I just think that you know that type of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.500 
I just think that you know that type of
behavior<00:02:35.530> will<00:02:36.100> continue<00:02:36.640> i<00:02:36.670> think<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.060> NFL

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
behavior will continue i think the NFL

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.229 
behavior will continue i think the NFL
was<00:02:37.810> happy<00:02:38.410> with<00:02:38.530> EA<00:02:38.709> EA<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.760> happy<00:02:39.970> with<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
was happy with EA EA is happy with the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.059 
was happy with EA EA is happy with the
NFL<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.870> they're<00:02:40.989> both<00:02:41.170> making<00:02:41.380> money<00:02:41.770> so

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
NFL and they're both making money so

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.910 
NFL and they're both making money so
that's<00:02:42.940> probably<00:02:43.239> when<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.750> see<00:02:43.959> now

did<00:03:54.070> at<00:03:54.220> least<00:03:54.340> have<00:03:54.579> real<00:03:54.880> people<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:55.299> that

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
did at least have real people in that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.229 
did at least have real people in that
game<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.290> didn't<00:03:56.560> do<00:03:56.650> well<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.400> part<00:03:58.120> of

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
game and it didn't do well and part of

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.229 
game and it didn't do well and part of
that<00:03:58.359> is<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:59.109> 2k<00:03:59.620> as<00:03:59.769> well<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.190> wasn't<00:04:00.730> marketed

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
that is on 2k as well it wasn't marketed

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.160 
that is on 2k as well it wasn't marketed
well<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.769> what<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:04.660> it's<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.959> lot

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
well so it is what it is so it's a lot

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.039 
well so it is what it is so it's a lot
of<00:04:05.200> questions<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:05.950> air<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.780> it's<00:04:07.780> not<00:04:08.019> a

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
of questions in the air and it's not a

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.349 
of questions in the air and it's not a
lot<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:09.160> know<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.670> not<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.910> lot<00:04:10.329> of

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
lot of you know it's not a lot of

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.210 
lot of you know it's not a lot of
guarantees<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.620> there's<00:04:11.769> nothing<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
guarantees and there's nothing that I

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.620 
guarantees and there's nothing that I
can<00:04:12.250> really<00:04:12.519> hang<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> sec<00:04:13.269> yeah<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.480> think

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
can really hang on a sec yeah I think

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.720 
can really hang on a sec yeah I think
they<00:04:13.930> will<00:04:14.109> do<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.440> because<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.980> this<00:04:15.459> or

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
they will do that because of this or

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.909 
they will do that because of this or
because<00:04:15.820> of<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.390> we<00:04:17.109> don't<00:04:17.289> there's<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:17.859> a

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
because of that we don't there's not a

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.750 
because of that we don't there's not a
lot<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.160> that<00:04:18.370> out<00:04:18.400> there<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:21.160> know<00:04:21.280> even<00:04:21.489> look

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
lot of that out there you know even look

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.850 
lot of that out there you know even look
at<00:04:21.940> situations<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.200> most<00:04:23.410> recent

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860

Kickstarter program but you know the
collegiate<00:04:26.350> football<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:27.669> they<00:04:27.849> were

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
collegiate football that they were

trying to do they've already counseled

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.679 
trying to do they've already counseled
that<00:04:30.070> effort

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
that effort

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.070 
that effort
as<00:04:31.619> far<00:04:31.889> as<00:04:31.919> earning<00:04:32.369> funds<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:32.969> so<00:04:33.749> as<00:04:33.899> you

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
as far as earning funds for so as you

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.869 
as far as earning funds for so as you
can<00:04:34.199> tell<00:04:34.259> it's<00:04:34.649> not<00:04:34.799> just<00:04:35.039> 2k<00:04:35.459> its<00:04:35.669> other

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
can tell it's not just 2k its other

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.989 
can tell it's not just 2k its other
companies<00:04:36.389> alike<00:04:36.659> and<00:04:36.899> other<00:04:37.080> devs<00:04:37.409> that<00:04:38.249> seem

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:38.999 
companies alike and other devs that seem

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.219 
companies alike and other devs that seem
like<00:04:39.029> they<00:04:39.209> just<00:04:39.479> don't<00:04:39.689> want<00:04:39.839> to<00:04:39.899> take<00:04:40.079> a<00:04:40.110> stab

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
like they just don't want to take a stab

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.469 
like they just don't want to take a stab
at<00:04:43.399> another<00:04:44.399> thing<00:04:44.699> you<00:04:44.909> know<00:04:45.029> I<00:04:45.059> think<00:04:45.329> that

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
at another thing you know I think that

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.600 
at another thing you know I think that
was<00:04:45.629> the<00:04:45.809> way<00:04:46.049> in<00:04:46.259> vacay<00:04:46.709> would<00:04:46.889> be<00:04:47.039> new

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
was the way in vacay would be new

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.469 
was the way in vacay would be new
consoles<00:04:48.239> that<00:04:48.599> means<00:04:48.839> new<00:04:49.110> development

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
consoles that means new development

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.239 
consoles that means new development
we're<00:04:51.479> moving<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:51.839> new<00:04:51.989> console<00:04:52.499> so<00:04:52.829> that<00:04:53.009> means

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:53.249 
we're moving a new console so that means

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.819 
we're moving a new console so that means
that<00:04:53.519> 2k<00:04:53.699> will<00:04:54.689> have<00:04:54.869> to<00:04:55.019> start<00:04:55.439> to<00:04:55.709> develop

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:55.829 
that 2k will have to start to develop

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.299 
that 2k will have to start to develop
for<00:04:56.309> the<00:04:56.399> new<00:04:56.579> console<00:04:57.149> and<00:04:57.949> you<00:04:58.949> know<00:04:59.069> who

00:04:59.299 --> 00:04:59.309 
for the new console and you know who

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:01.909 
for the new console and you know who
knows<00:04:59.549> what<00:05:00.329> that<00:05:00.629> entails<00:05:01.289> or<00:05:01.559> how<00:05:01.709> long<00:05:01.860> it

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
knows what that entails or how long it

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.919 
knows what that entails or how long it
would<00:05:02.189> take<00:05:02.219> for<00:05:02.399> them<00:05:02.579> to<00:05:02.669> do<00:05:02.879> that<00:05:03.059> or<00:05:03.329> what

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:03.929 
would take for them to do that or what

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.029 
would take for them to do that or what
they're<00:05:04.110> waiting<00:05:04.259> for<00:05:04.649> maybe<00:05:04.860> they're

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
they're waiting for maybe they're

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.709 
they're waiting for maybe they're
waiting<00:05:05.159> to<00:05:05.369> see<00:05:05.429> if<00:05:05.610> they<00:05:05.819> can<00:05:05.939> get<00:05:06.029> a<00:05:06.089> chance

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
waiting to see if they can get a chance

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.839 
waiting to see if they can get a chance
at<00:05:06.899> the<00:05:06.989> license<00:05:07.379> who<00:05:07.559> knows<00:05:07.829> but<00:05:08.519> we<00:05:08.669> already

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
at the license who knows but we already

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.059 
at the license who knows but we already
know<00:05:09.149> that<00:05:09.179> they're<00:05:09.419> behind<00:05:09.689> the<00:05:09.869> curve<00:05:10.110> and

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
know that they're behind the curve and

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.519 
know that they're behind the curve and
now<00:05:11.639> they<00:05:11.849> have<00:05:11.969> to<00:05:12.089> develop<00:05:12.419> on<00:05:12.749> a<00:05:13.050> brand<00:05:13.379> new

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:13.529 
now they have to develop on a brand new

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.229 
now they have to develop on a brand new
car<00:05:13.769> so<00:05:14.039> so<00:05:14.249> that<00:05:14.459> could<00:05:14.610> slow<00:05:14.849> down<00:05:14.999> their

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:15.239 
car so so that could slow down their

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:20.239 
car so so that could slow down their
progress<00:05:17.599> you<00:05:18.599> know<00:05:18.629> it's<00:05:18.899> just<00:05:18.959> I<00:05:19.349> don't<00:05:20.099> know

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 
progress you know it's just I don't know

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.869 
progress you know it's just I don't know
I<00:05:20.579> just<00:05:20.669> don't<00:05:21.059> feel<00:05:21.149> confident<00:05:21.899> about<00:05:22.879> 2k

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
I just don't feel confident about 2k

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.540 
I just don't feel confident about 2k
sports<00:05:24.269> returning<00:05:24.839> I<00:05:25.219> think<00:05:26.219> there's<00:05:26.369> too

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
sports returning I think there's too

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.249 
sports returning I think there's too
many<00:05:26.699> negatives<00:05:26.969> weighing<00:05:27.419> against<00:05:27.869> them<00:05:27.989> and

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
many negatives weighing against them and

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.409 
many negatives weighing against them and
I<00:05:28.919> honestly<00:05:29.129> think<00:05:29.579> the<00:05:29.699> longer<00:05:30.029> they<00:05:30.239> wait

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
I honestly think the longer they wait

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.409 
I honestly think the longer they wait
the<00:05:30.559> worse<00:05:31.559> off<00:05:31.860> they're<00:05:32.039> gonna<00:05:32.159> be<00:05:32.399> you<00:05:33.299> know

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
the worse off they're gonna be you know

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.419 
the worse off they're gonna be you know
some<00:05:33.809> people<00:05:34.110> may<00:05:34.259> believe<00:05:34.319> in<00:05:34.829> EA<00:05:34.979> some

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:35.429 
some people may believe in EA some

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:37.439 
people may not believe in EA but you

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.919 
people may not believe in EA but you

and things of that nature not that deep

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.369 
and things of that nature not that deep
but<00:06:58.000> the<00:06:59.000> game<00:06:59.210> definitely<00:06:59.509> had<00:06:59.780> his<00:06:59.900> moments

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:00.379 
but the game definitely had his moments
