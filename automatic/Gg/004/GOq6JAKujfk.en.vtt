be tight cause I think everyone has to
take<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> check<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.970> then<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> guy<00:02:30.750> on

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
saying that might be really really

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.660

really great for the online community

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.520 
really great for the online community
and<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.630> think<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.170> back<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and I think this is the back of the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.290 
and I think this is the back of the
truck<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.890> means<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.489> know<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.940> heist

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
truck so that means we know that a heist

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.360 
truck so that means we know that a heist
is<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.110> Los<00:03:34.530> Santos<00:03:34.709> as<00:03:35.130> one<00:03:35.280> is
