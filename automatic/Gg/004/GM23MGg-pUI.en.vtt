better<00:01:36.890> spell<00:01:37.250> in<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.459> game<00:01:37.610> when<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.880> comes

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
better spell in the game when it comes

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
bomb is again very very nice I just like

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.190 
bomb is again very very nice I just like
it<00:02:13.459> especially<00:02:14.090> with<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.720> way<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.080> works

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
it especially with the way that it works

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.380 
it especially with the way that it works
with<00:02:15.410> ice<00:02:15.620> Lance<00:02:15.920> get<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.370> fresh<00:02:16.610> frost<00:02:17.060> bomb

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
with ice Lance get that fresh frost bomb

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.330 
with ice Lance get that fresh frost bomb
down<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.349> start<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.680> slanting<00:02:19.160> all<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
down and it start I slanting all the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
down and it start I slanting all the
targets<00:02:19.550> watch<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.150> explode<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:21.110> everything

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
targets watch it explode to everything

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.110 
targets watch it explode to everything
around<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.920> now<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.220> obviously<00:02:22.640> has<00:02:22.879> been

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
around it now it obviously has been

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.699 
around it now it obviously has been
nerfed<00:02:23.330> quite<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:23.660> bit<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.560> really

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
nerfed quite a bit but it's really

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.000 
nerfed quite a bit but it's really
really<00:02:24.830> nice<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.630> freeze<00:02:26.960> ability<00:02:27.470> where

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
really nice the the freeze ability where

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.470 
really nice the the freeze ability where
you<00:02:28.130> get<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.460> charges<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.060> it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
you get to charges of it

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.410 
you get to charges of it
again<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.989> replaces<00:02:30.500> your<00:02:30.620> frost<00:02:30.950> nova<00:02:31.420> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
again it replaces your frost nova and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.410 
again it replaces your frost nova and
again<00:02:33.290> i<00:02:33.319> just<00:02:33.409> don't<00:02:33.950> find<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.670> damage<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.299> be

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
again i just don't find the damage to be

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.960 
again i just don't find the damage to be
sufficient<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.319> really<00:02:36.860> cover<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.459> amount<00:02:37.580> of

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
sufficient to really cover the amount of

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.000 
sufficient to really cover the amount of
that<00:02:38.450> extra<00:02:38.930> ticking<00:02:39.319> damage<00:02:39.680> having<00:02:39.920> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
that extra ticking damage having that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.580 
that extra ticking damage having that
extra<00:02:40.190> spell<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.090> can<00:02:41.269> cast<00:02:41.590> especially

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
extra spell that you can cast especially

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.990 
extra spell that you can cast especially
because<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.890> don't<00:02:43.159> always<00:02:43.370> want<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.730> freeze

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
because you don't always want to freeze

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.089 
because you don't always want to freeze
the<00:02:44.150> target<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.720> having<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.620> do<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.950> with

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
the target and having to do that with

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.220 
the target and having to do that with
your<00:02:46.220> other<00:02:46.370> spell<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:47.480> kind<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.870> makes<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
your other spell really kind of makes it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.530 
your other spell really kind of makes it
a<00:02:48.349> very<00:02:48.379> finicky<00:02:48.980> ability<00:02:49.580> i'm<00:02:49.879> kind<00:02:50.450> of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
a very finicky ability i'm kind of

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.610 
a very finicky ability i'm kind of
curious<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:50.989> that's<00:02:51.170> not<00:02:51.349> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.560> be

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
curious if that's not going to be

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.280 
curious if that's not going to be
reworked<00:02:52.190> here<00:02:52.459> before<00:02:52.819> release<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:54.110> that's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
reworked here before release but that's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.660 
reworked here before release but that's
just<00:02:54.440> my<00:02:54.650> thoughts<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.370> far<00:02:55.670> as<00:02:55.790> glyphs<00:02:56.090> go

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
just my thoughts as far as glyphs go

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.339 
just my thoughts as far as glyphs go
again<00:02:58.670> really<00:02:59.000> up<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.480> with<00:02:59.629> frost<00:03:00.019> I

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
again really up to you with frost I

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.910 
again really up to you with frost I
really<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.900> know<00:03:03.019> obviously<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.470> slant

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
really like you know obviously I slant

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.559 
really like you know obviously I slant
so<00:03:04.069> you<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.280> get<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.400> extra<00:03:04.819> damage<00:03:05.090> going

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
so you can get that extra damage going

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.509 
so you can get that extra damage going
out<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.590> frost<00:03:06.860> fighter<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.510> ok<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:09.049> the

out the frost fighter is ok I like the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.400 
out the frost fighter is ok I like the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
you know I see veins as well there's a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.470 
you know I see veins as well there's a
couple<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.769> different<00:03:13.160> combinations<00:03:14.000> that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
couple of different combinations that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.759 
couple of different combinations that
you<00:03:14.569> can<00:03:14.750> really<00:03:14.900> use<00:03:14.989> here<00:03:15.349> that<00:03:15.500> are<00:03:15.590> nice

you can really use here that are nice
and<00:03:16.010> as<00:03:16.310> far<00:03:16.459> as<00:03:16.579> minor<00:03:16.819> glyphs<00:03:17.120> obviously

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
and as far as minor glyphs obviously

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.930 
and as far as minor glyphs obviously
momentum<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.379> always<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:18.890> good<00:03:19.010> but<00:03:19.790> then

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
momentum is always really good but then

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.270 
momentum is always really good but then
having<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.450> big<00:03:20.720> oversized<00:03:21.290> water<00:03:21.620> Lord<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.160> me

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
rolling around I just think it looks

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.720 
rolling around I just think it looks
really<00:03:27.019> really<00:03:27.349> cool<00:03:27.379> so<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.099> tend<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.640> use

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
really really cool so I tend to use

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.940 
really really cool so I tend to use
those<00:03:29.150> as<00:03:29.390> well<00:03:29.569> so<00:03:30.109> keep<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.319> in<00:03:30.470> mind<00:03:30.709> when

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
those as well so keep that in mind when

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.589 
those as well so keep that in mind when
you<00:03:31.040> go<00:03:31.160> through<00:03:31.310> those<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:31.640> as<00:03:32.090> far<00:03:32.359> as<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
you go through those now as far as the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.479 
you go through those now as far as the
frost<00:03:32.870> mage<00:03:33.109> kind<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.470> general<00:03:33.889> guidelines

again<00:03:37.190> like<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.549> said<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:37.910> my<00:03:37.940> arcane<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.569> my

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
again like I said in my arcane in my

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.990 
again like I said in my arcane in my
fire<00:03:38.900> video<00:03:39.260> prismatic<00:03:39.950> Krystal<00:03:40.639> it<00:03:40.790> just

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
fire video prismatic Krystal it just

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.670 
fire video prismatic Krystal it just
doesn't<00:03:41.450> seem<00:03:41.750> like<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.139> worth<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.650> right

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
doesn't seem like it's worth it right

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.500 
doesn't seem like it's worth it right
now<00:03:43.069> you're<00:03:43.819> really<00:03:44.000> going<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.299> have<00:03:44.480> to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
now you're really going to have to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.659 
now you're really going to have to
extend<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.230> timing<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.250> think<00:03:46.400> it's

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
extend the timing of that I think it's

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.309 
extend the timing of that I think it's
going<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.819> have<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.000> be<00:03:47.239> up<00:03:47.480> for<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.930> little<00:03:47.989> bit

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
going to have to be up for a little bit

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.539 
going to have to be up for a little bit
longer<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.799> order<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.099> really<00:03:49.190> see<00:03:49.430> the

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
longer in order to really see the

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.580 
longer in order to really see the
benefit<00:03:49.970> out<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.359> compared<00:03:51.109> to<00:03:51.169> some<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.470> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
benefit out that compared to some of the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.370 
benefit out that compared to some of the
other<00:03:51.650> talents<00:03:52.340> now<00:03:52.849> it's<00:03:53.720> really<00:03:54.049> up<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.349> you

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
other talents now it's really up to you

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.020 
other talents now it's really up to you
how<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.650> want<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:55.010> use<00:03:55.069> it<00:03:55.310> but<00:03:55.340> again<00:03:55.669> this<00:03:55.849> is

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
how you want to use it but again this is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.089 
how you want to use it but again this is
just<00:03:56.150> my<00:03:56.450> thinking<00:03:56.870> behind<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.530> but<00:03:57.889> take<00:03:58.069> a

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
just my thinking behind it but take a

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.589 
just my thinking behind it but take a
look<00:03:58.190> at<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.489> level<00:03:58.730> 100<00:03:59.090> talents<00:03:59.419> take<00:03:59.569> a

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
look at the level 100 talents take a

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.870 
look at the level 100 talents take a
look<00:03:59.750> at<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.989> rest<00:04:00.169> of<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.349> footage<00:04:00.760> let<00:04:01.760> me

frost mage right now obviously for

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.949 
frost mage right now obviously for
leveling<00:04:07.160> like<00:04:07.310> we<00:04:07.489> always<00:04:07.730> know<00:04:08.180> frost

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
leveling like we always know frost

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.629 
leveling like we always know frost
leveling<00:04:09.500> seems<00:04:09.889> to<00:04:10.069> be<00:04:10.190> really<00:04:10.310> really<00:04:10.430> good

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
leveling seems to be really really good

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.270 
leveling seems to be really really good
you<00:04:10.880> get<00:04:11.030> good<00:04:11.209> control<00:04:11.750> good<00:04:12.049> CC<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:13.160> get

you get good control good CC you get
that<00:04:13.430> pet<00:04:13.730> phrase<00:04:14.060> for<00:04:14.329> those<00:04:14.450> free<00:04:14.720> ice<00:04:14.900> Lance

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
that pet phrase for those free ice Lance

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.159 
that pet phrase for those free ice Lance
prox<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:17.150> there's<00:04:17.359> just<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.570> lot<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.930> things

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
prox and there's just a lot of things

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.690 
prox and there's just a lot of things
that<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.349> can<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.739> really<00:04:19.099> make<00:04:19.280> leveling

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
that you can do to really make leveling

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.060 
that you can do to really make leveling
easy<00:04:20.000> as<00:04:20.239> frost<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.900> think<00:04:21.380> it's<00:04:21.470> honestly<00:04:21.829> that

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
easy as frost I think it's honestly that

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.129 
easy as frost I think it's honestly that
the<00:04:22.370> best<00:04:22.610> leveling<00:04:23.120> spec<00:04:23.240> for<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.599> mage<00:04:23.870> is

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
the best leveling spec for a mage is

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.770 
the best leveling spec for a mage is
frost<00:04:24.770> right<00:04:25.070> now<00:04:25.220> fire<00:04:25.849> would<00:04:26.120> be<00:04:26.150> second<00:04:26.750> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
frost right now fire would be second and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.839 
frost right now fire would be second and
then<00:04:26.960> arcane<00:04:27.410> being<00:04:27.740> third<00:04:28.010> now<00:04:28.220> arcane<00:04:28.699> is<00:04:28.820> a

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
then arcane being third now arcane is a

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.430 
then arcane being third now arcane is a
ton<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.150> fun<00:04:29.449> and<00:04:29.900> I'm<00:04:30.020> going<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.169> do<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.289> video

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
ton of fun and I'm going to do a video

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.980 
ton of fun and I'm going to do a video
on<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.740> again<00:04:31.190> shortly<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:32.449> as<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.840> guys

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
on that again shortly but as you guys

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.740 
on that again shortly but as you guys
can<00:04:33.169> see<00:04:33.229> with<00:04:33.680> some<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.130> some<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.210> DPS

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
can see with some of the some of the DPS

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.279 
can see with some of the some of the DPS
and<00:04:35.780> so

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
and so

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.889 
and so
the<00:04:36.349> numbers<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:37.089> frost<00:04:38.089> is<00:04:38.330> very<00:04:38.539> proc

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:38.899 
the numbers is frost is very proc

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:40.480 
the numbers is frost is very proc
centric<00:04:39.349> and<00:04:39.439> if<00:04:39.559> you<00:04:39.649> go<00:04:39.770> through<00:04:40.009> those<00:04:40.129> huge

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
centric and if you go through those huge

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.790 
centric and if you go through those huge
drought<00:04:40.819> times<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.779> just<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.589> really

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
drought times it just is really

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.439 
drought times it just is really
lackluster<00:04:43.189> you<00:04:43.669> find<00:04:43.909> it<00:04:43.999> to<00:04:44.089> be<00:04:44.119> very<00:04:44.210> very

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
lackluster you find it to be very very

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.600 
lackluster you find it to be very very
boring<00:04:44.990> however<00:04:45.710> what<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:45.979> do<00:04:46.159> start<00:04:46.369> to<00:04:46.430> get

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
boring however what you do start to get

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.489 
boring however what you do start to get
a<00:04:46.639> lot<00:04:46.789> of<00:04:46.819> prox<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.689> the<00:04:47.839> decision-making

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:48.499 
a lot of prox then the decision-making

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.950 
a lot of prox then the decision-making
starts<00:04:48.889> come<00:04:49.129> in<00:04:49.309> remember<00:04:50.270> with<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:50.719> drain

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
starts come in remember with the drain

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.499 
starts come in remember with the drain
or<00:04:51.139> percs<00:04:51.499> you<00:04:52.009> can<00:04:52.129> get<00:04:52.249> that<00:04:52.399> extra<00:04:52.849> ice

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
or percs you can get that extra ice

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.299 
or percs you can get that extra ice
Lance<00:04:53.899> the<00:04:54.080> extra<00:04:54.349> fingers<00:04:54.649> of<00:04:54.770> frost<00:04:55.009> prac

Lance the extra fingers of frost prac

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.549 
Lance the extra fingers of frost prac
which<00:04:55.520> again<00:04:55.789> very<00:04:56.629> very<00:04:56.749> useful<00:04:57.139> you'd<00:04:57.439> be

00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:57.559 
which again very very useful you'd be

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.290 
amazed at how many prox you were missing
before<00:05:00.379> when<00:05:00.889> you<00:05:00.979> only<00:05:01.099> could<00:05:01.339> have<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.759> now

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
before when you only could have to now

before when you only could have to now
you<00:05:02.360> have<00:05:02.689> three<00:05:02.749> it's<00:05:03.229> like<00:05:03.319> wow<00:05:03.559> I'm<00:05:03.830> getting

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:15.709

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.519
