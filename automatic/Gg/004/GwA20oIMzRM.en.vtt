00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.970
 Hello 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.480
 today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.950
 negotiation that is very common and very 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.079
 difficult to negotiate over the phone 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.480
 the phone is certainly one of the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.680
 tools you use most to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.420
 negotiate various situations of the day to day 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 routine or even involves a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.899
 low values are usually resolved 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.370
 by phone when the values â€‹â€‹in play 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 are larger or complex 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.430
 negotiating over the phone can be a 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.210
 danger a danger to you see only these 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 points 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.320
 The time it flies when we talk to the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.170
 telephone 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.300
 Have you seen this at the face-to-face meeting? 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 but to discuss a subject for almost half 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.299
 hour one hour without any problem 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 already on a long distance call 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.119
 we tend to finish soon 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 even by the value of the account and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.859
 also ear becomes warm goes 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 Portuguese and fill the bag stay in the 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.479
 telephone 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.509
 that makes us rush our 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.780
 arguments and practically eliminate almost 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.709
 whole of the initial social part of the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.590
 conversation 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.179
 Another problem is that you can 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.329
 distract 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.950
 It seems like a joke but when we 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.289
 we got a call from those 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.899
 important even we can not 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.060
 find a calculator and can not 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.670
 find that folder that is with 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.979
 all transaction documents do not 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.490
 Can you find the last one and mail that we 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.579
 We exchanged with the client nothing for 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.279
 further complicate a colleague 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.289
 begins to mimic a 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.119
 document for you to sign we do not 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.390
 know who pays attention will be a 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.890
 point to the phone 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.910
 Another problem that exists on the phone 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.290
 an interpretation 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 how often a connection quality 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.840
 even a bad noise that exists in the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.599
 company around them make it almost 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.340
 impossible to understand the other side is 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.610
 Speaking 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:35.269
 is not 36 and a half-dozen screaming to this 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.959
 then a contract in which he looks at her 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.110
 phone is much easier to receive 111 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.360
 do not look really i'm not much 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.739
 interested in the moment to disconnect 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.720
 Why are we calling a meeting? 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.900
 urgent call another time, people 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.140
 talk calmly, like never 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.569
 I ended up dating relationship for 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.099
 phone to the phone and everything is more 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.940
 easy and we 're harder then 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.360
 Let's see how we can 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.269
 problems 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.040
 the first suggestion seems strange 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.060
 but it is the following that the negotiation is 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.450
 that's right 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.489
 when someone calls to you the advantage is 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.629
 from the back yard across the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.090
 line 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.040
 this person concentrated thought of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.470
 all possibilities 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.319
 made the calculations of the excel of the life and the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.190
 illy gol and you're thinking about 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.190
 what at that moment does not feel in the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.959
 obligation to negotiate 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.180
 Are you unprepared or say prepared? 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.220
 say something like that guy does not look 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.630
 I'm in my living room now, can I call? 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.269
 two minutes 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.030
 hence you find your calculator week one 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.340
 planning without a quick alias if you 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.519
 want a negotiation plan is 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.930
 just send an email to the spreadsheet 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.959
 at the end of the workshop 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.810
 a very detailed thing about how to plan 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.370
 a negotiation not to have surprises, right? 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.150
 There you are if you 're in the office. 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.400
 I locked the door and saw distractions and 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.310
 Now, if you call back, you make one. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.169
 call and of course you know my friend my 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.430
 friend if you have in your car is 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.740
 better to give a car even to 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.560
 avoid an accident a fine ever 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.599
 I was running on the phone 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.770
 an airplane is leaving you entering a 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:39.110
 meeting is cold when possible use up 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.880
 even a headset 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.890
 you can leave your hands 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.810
 free to notice anything to 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:50.900
 leaf through a proposal to see an e-mail 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.330
 book time does not trade if you have 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.620
 middle of an important meeting which is 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.460
 everybody there with arms crossed 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.250
 watching you point the clock does not 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.530
 does not create time pressure for 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:10.430
 yourself and now important in making a 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.170
 summary at the end of the negotiation 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.580
 phone to offer a summary 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.020
 send to your caller this 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.720
 abstract by email 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.380
 I know it gives more work but it stays 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.930
 their interpretation of the facts and 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.680
 in the end that's what counts 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.690
 remember to always negotiate to win 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.690
 big hug and good business
