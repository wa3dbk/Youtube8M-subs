Gregory especially right now I would say

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.740

water temperatures coming up with the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
water temperatures coming up with the
overpopulation<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.619> anything

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
overpopulation it's just like anything

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.950 
overpopulation it's just like anything
there's<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.670> stress<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> fisheries

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there's more stress on the fisheries

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
there's more stress on the fisheries
there's<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.740> competition<00:01:35.240> there's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> lot

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
there's more competition there's a lot

of<00:01:36.509> competition<00:01:37.320> already<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> lake<00:01:38.369> for

of competition already in the lake for
food<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> resources<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> right<00:01:41.610> now<00:01:41.759> that's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
food and resources so right now that's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
food and resources so right now that's
it<00:01:42.570> seems<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> rise<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it seems like with the rise and the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.100 
it seems like with the rise and the
water<00:01:45.119> temperatures<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> see

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
water temperatures you're going to see

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.940

some<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.530> some<00:01:46.860> some<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.729> more
