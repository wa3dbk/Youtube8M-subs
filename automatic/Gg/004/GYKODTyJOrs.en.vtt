00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
some reason breathing this are the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.950 
some reason breathing this are the
toriel<00:00:28.080> batteries

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
toriel batteries

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.900 
toriel batteries
I've<00:00:30.960> made<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.320> batteries<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:32.099> six

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
I've made this batteries about six

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.600 
I've made this batteries about six
months<00:00:33.210> ago<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.559> still<00:00:34.890> running<00:00:35.129> until

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
months ago and it's still running until

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.560 
months ago and it's still running until
now<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:38.489> batteries<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.870> need<00:00:40.050> charging

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
now this batteries don't need charging

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.830 
now this batteries don't need charging
when<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.690> hope<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.489> running<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:45.090> three

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
when I hope it can running about three

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.220 
when I hope it can running about three
years<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:50.239> I've<00:00:51.239> made<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> battery
