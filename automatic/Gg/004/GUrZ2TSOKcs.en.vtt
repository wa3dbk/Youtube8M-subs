video<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> internet<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.330> other<00:00:15.389> day<00:00:15.630> i

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
video on the internet the other day i

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:30.170 
video on the internet the other day i
was<00:00:16.170> impressed<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.369> way

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.300 

so<00:00:30.780> naturally<00:00:30.930> i<00:00:31.200> decided<00:00:31.590> i<00:00:31.740> would<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
so naturally i decided i would have to

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.770 
so naturally i decided i would have to
try<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.730> myself<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> course<00:00:33.690> the

try this for myself and of course the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
try this for myself and of course the
question<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.140> does<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.070> work<00:00:35.310> so<00:00:35.580> today

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
question is does it really work so today

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
knife is way more dangerous you have to
put<00:00:49.650> more<00:00:49.770> pressure<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.580> it'll<00:00:50.730> slip<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
put more pressure that it'll slip and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.640 
put more pressure that it'll slip and
jerk<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.570> sharp<00:00:51.809> knife<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.080> just<00:00:52.260> cut<00:00:52.440> there's

correctly<00:00:54.420> start<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.440> making<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.830> couple

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
correctly start off by making a couple

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
correctly start off by making a couple
of<00:00:56.220> cuts<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.580> one<00:00:56.730> side<00:00:56.940> flip<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:57.660> around<00:00:57.750> make

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of cuts on one side flip it around make

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.330 
of cuts on one side flip it around make
a<00:00:58.140> couple<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.440> cuts<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:58.920> side<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
a couple of cuts on the other side and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.410 
a couple of cuts on the other side and
this<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> course<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> most<00:01:00.180> dangerous

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this is of course the most dangerous

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.729 
this is of course the most dangerous
part<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.290> through<00:01:01.500> I'm

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
part because if I go right through I'm

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
part because if I go right through I'm
gonna<00:01:01.860> cut<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.129> hand<00:01:02.310> on<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.640> hopefully<00:01:02.820> we're

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
gonna cut my hand on so hopefully we're

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.310 
gonna cut my hand on so hopefully we're
not<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.600> angle<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.050> video

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
not going to have an angle it's video

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
not going to have an angle it's video
you're<00:01:04.530> real<00:01:14.360> alright<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.479> I've<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.690> some

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you're real alright so I've got some

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.540 
you're real alright so I've got some
layers<00:01:16.080> cut<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.440> next<00:01:16.800> step<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.399> cut

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
layers cut out next step is to cut

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.290 
layers cut out next step is to cut
around<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.880> inside<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> far<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
around the inside of the right so far so

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.520 
around the inside of the right so far so
good<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.660> we're<00:01:21.750> gonna<00:01:21.840> make<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> crosshatch

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
good now we're gonna make a crosshatch

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.639 
good now we're gonna make a crosshatch
of<00:01:22.770> different<00:01:23.130> pieces<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:27.509> ideally<00:01:27.990> we're

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
of different pieces and ideally we're

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:29.870 
of different pieces and ideally we're
done<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.160> put<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.310> into<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> bag

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
done just got to put it into this bag

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
done just got to put it into this bag
here<00:01:32.570> that'd<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.750> big<00:01:33.899> bag<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.710> guess

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
here that'd be a big bag then I guess

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
here that'd be a big bag then I guess
you're<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.100> supposed<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:39.979> squeeze<00:01:44.869> all

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you're just supposed to squeeze all

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
you're just supposed to squeeze all
right<00:01:46.020> well<00:01:46.280> how<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.520> pull<00:01:47.850> these

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.310 
right well how about I just pull these
guys<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> yeah<00:01:49.200> yeah<00:01:49.530> yeah<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.650> go<00:01:54.320> see

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
guys it yeah yeah yeah there we go see

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.370 
guys it yeah yeah yeah there we go see
if<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> makes<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.159> easier<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.240> squeeze<00:01:57.689> these

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:13.430 

there<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:05.719> shake<00:02:06.719> out<00:02:06.929> of<00:02:07.079> there<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:12.349> guess<00:02:13.349> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
there we go shake out of there I guess I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.570 
there we go shake out of there I guess I
didn't<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.709> all<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.890> way<00:02:13.980> through<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.370> piece

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
didn't go all the way through this piece

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:26.360 
didn't go all the way through this piece
that's<00:02:14.790> why<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.090> sticking<00:02:22.700> okay<00:02:25.040> cuz<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.129> just

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that's why it's sticking okay cuz I just

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.610 
that's why it's sticking okay cuz I just
break<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.790> part<00:02:27.209> off<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:30.620> think

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
break this part off and I actually think

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.039 
break this part off and I actually think
I<00:02:31.739> should<00:02:31.920> probably<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.400> another<00:02:32.959> cut<00:02:33.959> around

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049
