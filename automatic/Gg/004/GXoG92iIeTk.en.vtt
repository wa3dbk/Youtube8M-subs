00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.760 
think both teams would probably be
pretty<00:01:36.909> happy<00:01:37.179> with<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.509> point<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.139> a<00:01:38.350> goal<00:01:38.560> each

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
pretty happy with a point so a goal each

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.550 
pretty happy with a point so a goal each
you<00:01:39.429> would<00:01:39.639> be<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:39.969> reasonable<00:01:40.389> expectation<00:01:41.049> I

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
you would be a reasonable expectation I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.440 
you would be a reasonable expectation I
think<00:01:41.799> it's<00:01:42.520> not<00:01:42.639> something<00:01:42.909> I'm<00:01:43.030> going<00:01:43.240> for

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
think it's not something I'm going for

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.849 
think it's not something I'm going for
but<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:43.749> certainly<00:01:43.929> what<00:01:44.380> something<00:01:44.709> that's

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
but it's certainly what something that's

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.859 
but it's certainly what something that's
worth<00:01:45.009> keeping<00:01:45.369> an<00:01:45.459> eye<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.579> mm-hmm<00:01:46.389> well<00:01:46.719> the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
worth keeping an eye on mm-hmm well the

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.389 
worth keeping an eye on mm-hmm well the
over<00:01:47.200> there's<00:01:47.409> priced<00:01:47.709> at<00:01:47.920> one<00:01:48.100> point<00:01:48.279> nine

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
over there's priced at one point nine

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.399 
over there's priced at one point nine
one<00:01:48.819> so<00:01:49.149> if<00:01:49.630> our<00:01:49.749> viewers<00:01:49.869> thing<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.319> is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
one so if our viewers thing that is

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.510 
one so if our viewers thing that is
going<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.590> go<00:01:50.679> over<00:01:50.709> there's<00:01:51.189> still<00:01:51.340> some

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
going to go over there's still some

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.279 
going to go over there's still some
value<00:01:51.549> there<00:01:51.819> but<00:01:52.450> what<00:01:52.600> other<00:01:52.749> markets<00:01:53.170> are

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
value there but what other markets are

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.620 
value there but what other markets are
you<00:01:53.409> looking<00:01:53.709> assets<00:01:54.100> do<00:01:54.249> it<00:01:54.399> well<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:55.479> could

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
you looking assets do it well you could

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.539 
you looking assets do it well you could
look<00:01:55.689> for<00:01:56.139> the<00:01:56.380> agent<00:01:56.649> handicap<00:01:57.009> market<00:01:57.399> you

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
could look for the over/under market if

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.410 
could look for the over/under market if
you<00:01:59.409> felt<00:01:59.709> that<00:02:00.039> there<00:02:00.340> was<00:02:00.369> going<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.329> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
you felt that there was going to be a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.209 
you felt that there was going to be a
clear<00:02:01.719> winner<00:02:01.990> then<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:02.859> you<00:02:02.920> could

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.660 
clear winner then you know you could
certainly<00:02:03.429> look<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.819> that<00:02:03.909> area<00:02:04.149> as<00:02:04.479> well

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
certainly look in that area as well

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.949 
certainly look in that area as well
there's<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.759> lot<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:06.939> options<00:02:07.389> that<00:02:07.599> really<00:02:07.869> in

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
there's a lot of options that really in

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.779 
there's a lot of options that really in
this<00:02:08.080> one<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.770> know<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.160> game<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.670> can

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
this one but you know this game it can

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.100 
this one but you know this game it can
be<00:02:09.970> quite<00:02:10.149> unpredictable<00:02:10.509> so<00:02:10.959> someone

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
be quite unpredictable so someone

today from the team it's a better

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.100 
today from the team it's a better
advisor<00:02:18.710> what<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.520> well<00:02:20.510> Dario<00:02:20.840> belek

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
advisor what is that well Dario belek

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.930 
advisor what is that well Dario belek
had<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:21.740> chat<00:02:21.950> with<00:02:21.980> him<00:02:22.130> earlier<00:02:22.250> today<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.880> he

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
had a chat with him earlier today and he

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.850 
had a chat with him earlier today and he
said<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.270> go<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.690> roma<00:02:24.020> plus<00:02:24.290> point<00:02:24.620> five

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
said to go for roma plus point five

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.410 
said to go for roma plus point five
which<00:02:25.460> gives<00:02:25.670> them<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> little<00:02:26.060> bit<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.360> an

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
which gives them a little bit of an

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.570 
which gives them a little bit of an
advantage<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:27.530> think<00:02:28.070> that's<00:02:28.190> that's<00:02:28.430> a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
advantage I think that's that's a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.280 
advantage I think that's that's a
reasonable<00:02:28.910> bet<00:02:29.210> personally<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:30.080> actually

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
reasonable bet personally I'm actually

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.780 
reasonable bet personally I'm actually
just<00:02:30.470> going<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.710> go<00:02:30.830> for<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.070> straight<00:02:31.430> draw

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
just going to go for the straight draw

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.150 
just going to go for the straight draw
and<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.750> get<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:32.990> with<00:02:33.290> 3.6<00:02:33.950> with

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
and you can get that with 3.6 with

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.710 
and you can get that with 3.6 with
william<00:02:34.460> hill<00:02:34.490> i<00:02:34.670> think<00:02:35.000> it's<00:02:35.180> worth<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.570> at

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
william hill i think it's worth it at

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.360 
william hill i think it's worth it at
those<00:02:35.870> odds<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> i<00:02:36.470> do<00:02:36.710> think<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.130> both

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
those odds and i do think that both

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.740 
those odds and i do think that both
sides<00:02:37.550> will<00:02:37.700> be<00:02:37.850> happy<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.330> point<00:02:38.360> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
sides will be happy with a point and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.990 
sides will be happy with a point and
leave<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.650> all<00:02:40.459> right<00:02:40.670> well<00:02:40.820> it's

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
leave it at that all right well it's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.460 
leave it at that all right well it's
going<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.180> be<00:02:41.270> an<00:02:41.360> fantastic<00:02:41.959> match<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.260> can't

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
going to be an fantastic match I can't

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.470
