00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 Y 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.860
 Well, here we are , we have finished 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.930
 the tests we are very happy with the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.520
 result of the car we have already 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.680
 consider it a bit to my way to drive 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.300
 and well very happy and very excited 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.310
 eager to start the 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.710
 race and see to see where we can 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.140
 be and now I am very happy to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.760
 Start then do not give me a lot of confidence 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.910
 the car and we have continued to change 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.010
 adjustments helped us a lot the engineer of 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.980
 citroÃ«n sport and good at the end I think 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.570
 that is very to my way of driving and I 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.680
 I find very comfortable with him and nothing very 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.150
 happy and eager to start the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.710
 burden with thinking there is only one and 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.330
 Of course it is correct what I can and 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.979
 be as high as possible 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.020
 classification but good until not 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.360
 let's do the first stages no no 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.650
 we will know where we can be 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.290
 prioris is inside first he is going to 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.580
 be difficult because of the list of writings that 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.620
 there's no because it's an organ car 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.750
 motrices but well let's try 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.290
 risk and attack to the maximum to be 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 as high as possible
