00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
little way into the sea when I was a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.780 
little way into the sea when I was a
child<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.840> mean<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.049> toddler<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.950> mean<00:02:59.190> by<00:02:59.340> myself

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.170 
but it was a very polite bit of sea
because<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:01.709> mother<00:03:01.980> always<00:03:02.640> took<00:03:02.940> me<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.629 
thing and I when I made the scallop I
tried<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.350> bring<00:03:46.560> some<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.950> excitement<00:03:47.519> I

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
tried to bring some of the excitement I

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.090 
tried to bring some of the excitement I
feel<00:03:47.850> about<00:03:48.060> Benjamin<00:03:48.510> Britten's<00:03:48.780> music<00:03:49.260> into

the<00:03:50.190> structure<00:03:50.670> particularly<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.299> structure

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
the structure particularly the structure

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.930 
the structure particularly the structure
of<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.109> that<00:03:52.290> our<00:03:52.319> faces<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.100> sea<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.880> I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
of it so that our faces the sea and I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.640 
of it so that our faces the sea and I
think<00:03:54.150> everybody<00:03:54.510> has<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.900> conversation

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
think everybody has this conversation

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.860 
think everybody has this conversation
with<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.980> sea<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.970> scholar<00:03:57.239> actually<00:03:57.660> seems

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
with the sea the scholar actually seems

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.240 
with the sea the scholar actually seems
to<00:03:57.930> be<00:03:58.049> saved<00:03:58.290> coupled<00:03:58.650> with<00:03:58.680> people<00:03:59.100> be<00:03:59.220> very

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
to be saved coupled with people be very

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.860 
to be saved coupled with people be very
difficult<00:03:59.639> to<00:03:59.850> have<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.030> conversation<00:04:00.060> with

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
difficult to have a conversation with

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.770 
difficult to have a conversation with
your<00:04:00.989> husband<00:04:01.410> let<00:04:01.590> alone<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:03.030> sea<00:04:03.359> but<00:04:03.660> if

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
your husband let alone the sea but if

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.900 
your husband let alone the sea but if
you<00:04:03.900> happen<00:04:04.680> upon<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:05.130> sculpture<00:04:05.639> when

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
you happen upon that sculpture when

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.960 
you happen upon that sculpture when
you're<00:04:06.030> by<00:04:06.209> yourself<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:07.609> wanted<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.819> be<00:04:08.940> a

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
you're by yourself I wanted it to be a

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.460 
you're by yourself I wanted it to be a
sort<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.269> place<00:04:09.569> of<00:04:09.600> peace<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.349> could

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
sort of place of peace that you could

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.370 
sort of place of peace that you could
contemplate<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.250> horizon<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.030> chose<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
contemplate the horizon and I chose the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.589 
contemplate the horizon and I chose the
phrase<00:04:13.709> from<00:04:14.220> Peter<00:04:14.609> Grimes<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.239> hear<00:04:15.450> those

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
phrase from Peter Grimes I hear those

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.420 
phrase from Peter Grimes I hear those
voices<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:16.229> will<00:04:16.349> not<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.739> drawn<00:04:17.010> because<00:04:17.370> I

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
voices that will not be drawn because I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.219 
voices that will not be drawn because I
think<00:04:17.489> we<00:04:17.669> all<00:04:17.849> have<00:04:18.030> voices<00:04:18.180> inside<00:04:18.900> us<00:04:19.109> we

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
think we all have voices inside us we

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.930 
think we all have voices inside us we
probably<00:04:19.410> don't<00:04:19.739> listen<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.220> them<00:04:20.370> often

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
probably don't listen to them often

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.480 
probably don't listen to them often
enough<00:04:21.139> so<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.169> thought<00:04:22.349> had<00:04:22.530> Universal<00:04:23.250> as<00:04:23.460> a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
enough so I thought had Universal as a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.629 
enough so I thought had Universal as a
replication<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:25.770> think<00:04:25.950> people<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.370> talk

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
replication and I think people do talk

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.159 
replication and I think people do talk
to<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:26.849> sea<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.060> mean<00:04:27.330> with<00:04:27.479> not<00:04:27.690> for<00:04:27.810> nothing

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
to the sea I mean with not for nothing

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.430 
to the sea I mean with not for nothing
when<00:04:28.320> we're<00:04:29.099> an<00:04:29.190> island<00:04:29.430> race<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.389> there's<00:04:31.260> so

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
when we're an island race and there's so

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.320 
when we're an island race and there's so
many<00:04:31.500> references<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:32.130> Shakespeare<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
many references in Shakespeare to the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.310 
many references in Shakespeare to the
sea<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.919> course<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:35.430> had<00:04:35.640> great<00:04:36.390> people

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
sea and of course we had great people

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.230 
sea and of course we had great people
like<00:04:37.530> Nelson<00:04:37.950> although<00:04:38.610> cause<00:04:38.820> he<00:04:38.940> came<00:04:39.120> from

power of the thing and it really is very

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.980 
power of the thing and it really is very
humbling<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.349> one<00:04:46.499> does<00:04:46.710> feel<00:04:47.629> smaller<00:04:48.629> than
