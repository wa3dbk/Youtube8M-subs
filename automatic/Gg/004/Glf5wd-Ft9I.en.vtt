I'm Divyanka. I'm doing my second year in
Medical Engineering and I'm an international

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.289
student, basically from India and I've been
here for about two years now. First of all

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.520
I really like biology and maths, so that was
the subjects that I really fancied. So I came

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.930
to the uni's Open Day and I went through the
prospectus and I just wanted to make sure

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.900
the course I'm doing could have most of biology
in it and some of maths. So my mum suggested

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.770
me this course and it was quite interesting
to have the overview of the course because

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.230
it was basically replacing human parts and
bones so it was quite interesting. So I thought

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.700
okay I should be here. So when I first came
and I just saw The Atrium it was so nice,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.900
because the pictures on the website were quite
old, just the buildings. So I didn't know,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.690
it was quite nice to see and it was quite
green everywhere I just saw trees, flowers

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.921
and people around smiling, chatting so it
was really nice. So first thing I went to

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:13.920
EDT department and I met the Dean and Associate
Dean, they were so friendly, so I was like

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.110
okay I really like this uni. That's why I
chose this course, I was quite shuffling between

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.619
Manchester and Bradford, but then I really
liked the atmosphere in Bradford. Okay the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.189
labs I think they have really good equipment.
I think there's one instrument in Richmond

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.469
where you can remove proteins from your cells
so it was really nice, kind of scary as well.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.700
I think they have well equipped ones. I want
to do something in orthopaedics because it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.130
sounds really interesting because some of
my relatives have lost their legs and hip

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.439
replacements and stuff. So I think I want
to contribute something to society you know

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.679
helping them because nowadays I think the
people in the army they lose their legs quite

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.139
often, so it'll be great to have some other
replacement stuff so it's quite easier for

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:11.410
them. I'm planning to do a PhD, not sure though,
but I have to discuss. But I want to do something

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.770
now in the companies and learn some more and
then maybe do some MBA or PhD in what I'm

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.020
doing.
