one tiny Nick right on the side because
both<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.769> were<00:01:04.920> were<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.820> dang<00:01:06.270> shallow<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
both of them were were so dang shallow I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.789 
both of them were were so dang shallow I
mean<00:01:07.320> both<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> these<00:01:08.130> were<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.970> inches<00:01:09.479> in

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
mean both of these were at two inches in

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.039 
mean both of these were at two inches in
depth<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.280> I've<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:12.000> struggled<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.630> why

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
depth and I've really struggled with why

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.090 
depth and I've really struggled with why
they<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.740> shallow<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> area<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
they would be so shallow but the area is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
they would be so shallow but the area is
very<00:01:17.250> prone<00:01:17.789> to<00:01:18.030> flooding<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> water

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
very prone to flooding I think the water

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.779 
very prone to flooding I think the water
has<00:01:19.409> been<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:20.009> over<00:01:20.399> that<00:01:20.430> site

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
has been up and down over that site

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.450 
has been up and down over that site
probably<00:01:21.170> hundreds<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> times<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.280> past

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
probably hundreds of times in the past

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
probably hundreds of times in the past
200<00:01:24.030> years<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:27.109> you<00:01:28.109> would<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> would

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
200 years and you would think it would

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
200 years and you would think it would
deposit<00:01:29.039> more<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.700> maybe<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.689> I'm

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
deposit more but maybe only thing I'm

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
deposit more but maybe only thing I'm
figures<00:01:31.140> maybe<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.619> actually<00:01:31.950> taking

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
figures maybe it was actually taking

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
figures maybe it was actually taking
