00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.740
 to start guessing 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:57.320
 for detail you will make a two three 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.280
 four five six seven current to the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.520
 base 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.800
 a current to return in the current 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:12.979
 next to a low 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:19.360
 low point in the next repeating and to 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.360
 each current a low until the end 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:30.170
 base current at a point 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.430
 down turn piece like this and make a 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.320
 chain 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.670
 every beginning of career you will do 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.570
 a chain 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:44.000
 on the first point a low point on the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 near a low in the next one 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.760
 low and continue point over point 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.399
 until the end 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.890
 we have a total of seven lows 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.100
 and last point that is well hidden 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.100
 on here 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.830
 I already make a chain in the first 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.670
 point a low at the next one point 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.920
 low continuous points on point knots 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.540
 we are doing the third career here 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.989
 lows 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.620
 Let's work this way a total of 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.620
 32 rows always repeating this 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 here we work the 32 careers for the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.580
 our bow 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.769
 now we'll cut the wire leaving a 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.260
 piece for sewing upholstery needles 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.400
 You'll pass the rain and wind behind. 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.140
 to cast off 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.180
 We're going to turn our piece around like this. 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.880
 and here we are going to arrest the son of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.940
 down up 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:07.810
 we sell and we're stitching stitch 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.810
 point to form a ring like this 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:18.720
 I pick up on one side and pick up the speck on the other. 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.720
 that pulls little point 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.230
 until the last remark 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.910
 now we will cast off 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.680
 to make a snack for 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.730
 tie steel 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.590
 We're going to do the same ten 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.110
 chains 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.420
 this way the effect of chains makes 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.740
 a chain to turn on the second 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.350
 chain inserts needle a low 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:04:00.650
 next a low in the next 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:06.110
 repeating and continuous for each current 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:09.250
 we will have a low point until 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.250
 the end of them 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:18.100
 We worked until the end I make a 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.800
 current on the first low point 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.030
 1.10 on the second 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.990
 one point on the third one point 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.760
 down to each point that we 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.890
 we have in the base 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:40.160
 we will make a new low point until the end 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:44.630
 we'll cut the wire afterwards leaving 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.320
 a little bit to close the loop and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:53.300
 for application also if you will use 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:59.890
 the spoon to apply in so the latter 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:03.050
 point a low you will pull 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:10.520
 cut through inside this release 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:12.860
 and cut off this tip leaving already 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.250
 for closing 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:23.810
 so here we will spend the spring 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:28.210
 like this and close behind and with 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:32.560
 Now is the third we'll get and 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.560
 close spend ball 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.300
 this way 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:49.290
 To ride there, we close the door. 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.760
 by the way, the way, the bow before 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.260
 apply powder 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:59.310
 This way we're going to use that same 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:04.380
 line that we closed there stay 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:07.320
 ours is our bow, you are going 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.780
 put on that code half a point 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.950
 we did and low points will 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.910
 centered laterally 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.740
 way 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.800
 and here you will apply with small 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.919
 If you want, you can also 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.530
 be applied with the universal adhesive I 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:30.479
 Work always shows for you. 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:33.680
 Are you going to do this under the ribbon? 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.680
 you will get off 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.020
 This way I'm getting wire here. 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:44.160
 down without moving to the other side 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:48.150
 is not to leave the work ugly and do 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:54.030
 little dots like that to you 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:58.160
 firmness was born as soon as the 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.160
 children usually pick up also pull 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.950
 mainly through points 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:25.040
 do so learning ours so the 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.040
 ready and applied will be like this
