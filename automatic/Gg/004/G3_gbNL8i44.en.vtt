00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 maik franz get out of the office 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.779
 Welcome to the lawn 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.849
 freiburg at sc freiburg 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.019
 what made the difference for the stv leave 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.590
 opted for sc freiburg 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.179
 I think that's what it's got 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 football games halt freiburg has me 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 always impressed with her style 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.580
 how they play in the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.080
 last years stabilized first league 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.599
 it was very very unpleasant against her 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.359
 play and hope it all the more 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 more comfortable than playing with them 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.320
 what are the fans at the sc 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.239
 freiburg plays everything there 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 the years with what he identified 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 does 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.090
 and yes I will try my best 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.200
 to give 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 sometimes you realize that yes that player 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 as they become them they slip from the front 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 At the back they are from the first one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.940
 fc saarbrÃ¼cken 2008 to Nuremberg 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.530
 changed as a striker then they have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.789
 Nuremberg left outside right outside 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.190
 played now they last in the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.660
 We see back round as a sixth 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.330
 you soon in freiburg at sc freiburg 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.799
 continue on the defender position 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 front of course makes more fun but 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.020
 somebody depending on how that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.470
 team needs me as willing to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.729
 task to assume I think that is 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.640
 that they had already seen more often 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.470
 sailer later then or l that he with 27 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.880
 up to high but I think that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.799
 Of course you then have a certain amount 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.460
 experience in the center then more 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.680
 can help 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.619
 I did that in Nuremberg, I think 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.590
 it still descended and what, of course 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.509
 we were very sorry too which say 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 disappointed about it 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.610
 but of course for me personally what 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.410
 good was this position change 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.620
 of course, I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.550
 freiburg to continue where I am then 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.570
 rather in Nuremberg than late on pictures 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.900
 It is still twelve days until the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 Training kick-off on 25 june 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.729
 what does the task catalog say? 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.880
 maik franz still doing apartment search 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.530
 acclimatize 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.040
 that's how it will be in the next two weeks 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:17.060
 on the program we are today 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.200
 already does not have and we have 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.810
 of course a training plan 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.670
 I think so too 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.580
 I got there early , too 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.230
 already trained and then I'm there 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.590
 Are you at home with my family ? 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.010
 because is also important in saarland want 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.360
 have enough fuel right now and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.400
 Of course I am happy when it is 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.420
 finally starts 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.340
 that will be the case in twelve days 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.860
