relate<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.980> what<00:02:34.160> they<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:35.019> watch<00:02:36.019> things

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
relate to what they like watch things

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.349 
relate to what they like watch things
that<00:02:37.069> they<00:02:37.160> pick<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:37.819> I've<00:02:37.970> tried<00:02:38.180> to

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
that they pick and so I've tried to

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.030 
that they pick and so I've tried to
incorporate<00:02:38.630> some<00:02:39.079> of<00:02:39.109> that<00:02:39.260> into<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.680> design

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
incorporate some of that into the design

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.580 
incorporate some of that into the design
element<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.720> different<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.470> you're

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
element it is different if you're

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.420 
element it is different if you're
designing<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.160> an<00:02:43.430> older<00:02:43.850> age<00:02:44.030> group<00:02:45.430> but

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
designing for an older age group but

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.240 
designing for an older age group but
equally<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.060> wanted<00:02:47.329> is<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.600> have<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.720> fresh<00:02:48.250> so

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
equally I wanted is to have a fresh so

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.059 
equally I wanted is to have a fresh so
the<00:02:49.370> unique<00:02:49.760> look<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.230> isn't<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.410> TV

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
the unique look that isn't that TV

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.129 
the unique look that isn't that TV
companies<00:02:52.489> approve<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> script<00:02:53.209> then<00:02:54.109> a

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
companies approve the script then a

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.170 
companies approve the script then a
storyboard<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.859> done<00:02:55.069> so<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.639> traditional

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
storyboard is done so the traditional

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.410 
storyboard is done so the traditional
hand-drawn<00:02:56.810> fast<00:02:57.139> men<00:02:57.410> draw<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.799> board

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.240 

and<00:03:23.600> we<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:23.930> go<00:03:24.110> for<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.350> one<00:03:24.620> shot<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.890> time

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and we just go for it one shot a time

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.250 
and we just go for it one shot a time
frame<00:03:25.520> by<00:03:25.760> frame<00:03:25.790> with<00:03:26.270> individual<00:03:26.750> animators

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
frame by frame with individual animators

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.740 
frame by frame with individual animators
and<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.620> each<00:03:27.890> shot<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:29.090> approached<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:29.690> a

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
and so each shot is then approached on a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.400 
and so each shot is then approached on a
purely<00:03:30.590> separate<00:03:31.160> level<00:03:31.840> with<00:03:32.840> an<00:03:32.960> individual

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
purely separate level with an individual

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.810 
purely separate level with an individual
animator<00:03:33.740> taking<00:03:34.040> responsibility<00:03:34.580> for<00:03:34.640> a

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
animator taking responsibility for a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.870 
animator taking responsibility for a
short<00:03:35.090> scene<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.600> every<00:03:35.690> episode<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:37.220> within

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
short scene of every episode and within

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.980 
short scene of every episode and within
that<00:03:38.030> it's<00:03:38.240> broken<00:03:38.390> down<00:03:38.660> into<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
that it's broken down into the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.310 
that it's broken down into the
individual<00:03:39.320> individual<00:03:40.070> shots<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:41.320> they

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
individual individual shots and they

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.780 
individual individual shots and they
basically<00:03:42.560> step<00:03:43.130> through<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:43.550> me<00:03:43.670> as

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
basically step through it with me as

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.760 
basically step through it with me as
director<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.540> I'll<00:03:44.690> I'll<00:03:45.200> explain<00:03:45.530> what<00:03:45.740> I

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
director so I'll I'll explain what I

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.380 
director so I'll I'll explain what I
want<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.280> happen<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.790> shot<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.300> then

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
want to happen in that shot and then

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.300 
want to happen in that shot and then
within<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:47.870> then<00:03:48.140> they've<00:03:48.650> got<00:03:48.860> free<00:03:49.070> rein

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
within that then they've got free rein

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.210 
within that then they've got free rein
to<00:03:49.340> kind<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.820> add<00:03:49.940> their<00:03:50.120> own<00:03:50.150> humor<00:03:50.810> and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
a shots finish you've got a

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.870 
a shots finish you've got a
post-production<00:04:00.320> on<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.460> you<00:04:01.580> have<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
post-production on that so you have the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.610 
post-production on that so you have the
same<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.580> compositing

you know you've you've given that puppy

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.990 
you know you've you've given that puppy
a<00:06:27.759> breathing<00:06:28.759> living<00:06:29.650> voice<00:06:30.650> or<00:06:31.219> dance<00:06:31.669> move

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
a breathing living voice or dance move

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.050 
a breathing living voice or dance move
or<00:06:32.270> action<00:06:32.900> that<00:06:33.490> at<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.580> start<00:06:34.759> that<00:06:34.939> they

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
or action that at the start that they

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.119 
or action that at the start that they
didn't<00:06:35.300> exist<00:06:35.629> so<00:06:35.930> it's<00:06:36.440> quite<00:06:36.590> rewarding<00:06:36.770> in

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
didn't exist so it's quite rewarding in

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.529 
didn't exist so it's quite rewarding in
that<00:06:37.190> sense<00:06:37.520> I<00:06:37.639> think<00:06:37.819> as<00:06:37.909> an<00:06:38.029> animator<00:06:38.419> but

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.149 
that sense I think as an animator but
yeah<00:06:38.719> they<00:06:38.870> spend<00:06:39.620> a<00:06:39.680> lot<00:06:39.800> of<00:06:39.830> time<00:06:39.949> on<00:06:40.069> their
