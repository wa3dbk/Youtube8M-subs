00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
now we fired the pendant it's actually

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.230 
now we fired the pendant it's actually
metal<00:00:10.920> now<00:00:11.309> although<00:00:11.760> it<00:00:11.969> doesn't<00:00:12.120> really

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
metal now although it doesn't really

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.510 
metal now although it doesn't really
look<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:12.600> it<00:00:12.930> you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.110> probably<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.680> that

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
look like it you can probably see that

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.810 
look like it you can probably see that
it's<00:00:15.150> white<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> reason<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
it's white and the reason for that is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.019 
it's white and the reason for that is
that<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.380> crystals<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> surface<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.910> all

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that the crystals on the surface are all

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.849 
that the crystals on the surface are all
sort<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.330> standing<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.260> need<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.560> brush

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
sort of standing up but we need to brush

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.060 
sort of standing up but we need to brush
them<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:24.019> flatten<00:00:25.019> them<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> magical

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
finishing off the silver pendant there

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.070 
finishing off the silver pendant there
are<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:17.970> sorts<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> specialist<00:01:18.720> tool<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
are all sorts of specialist tool to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.500 
are all sorts of specialist tool to
burnish<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.400> fact<00:01:20.760> us<00:01:20.940> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.300> just

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
burnish with but in fact us this is just

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.719 
burnish with but in fact us this is just
about<00:01:21.869> getting<00:01:22.260> started<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
about getting started what I'm going to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.070 
about getting started what I'm going to
suggest<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:24.960> an

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
suggest is that you can just use an

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
suggest is that you can just use an
ordinary<00:01:25.260> stainless<00:01:26.010> steel<00:01:26.280> teaspoon<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
ordinary stainless steel teaspoon it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
ordinary stainless steel teaspoon it
doesn't<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.410> teaspoon<00:01:28.890> any<00:01:29.100> harm<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
doesn't do the the teaspoon any harm and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
doesn't do the the teaspoon any harm and
we're<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.690> be<00:01:30.810> using<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> tip<00:01:31.440> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
we're just going to be using the tip of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.070 
we're just going to be using the tip of
the<00:01:31.770> handle<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.180> sure<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.509> stainless

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
the handle and make sure it's stainless

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.859 
the handle and make sure it's stainless
steel<00:01:34.729> furnishing<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.850> simply<00:01:36.180> compressing

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
steel furnishing is simply compressing

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
steel furnishing is simply compressing
the<00:01:37.140> surface<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> silver<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> really

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the surface of the silver if you really

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
the surface of the silver if you really
burnish<00:01:39.720> hard<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.409> often<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.830> an<00:01:41.190> almost

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
burnish hard you can often get an almost

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.300 
burnish hard you can often get an almost
mirror<00:01:41.909> surface<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.800> simple<00:01:43.950> as

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
mirror surface so it's as simple as

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
mirror surface so it's as simple as
applying<00:01:44.580> pressure<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.600> rubbing<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
applying pressure and rubbing the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.730 
applying pressure and rubbing the
stainless<00:01:47.280> steel<00:01:47.479> over<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:49.050> raised<00:01:49.320> bits

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
stainless steel over the the raised bits

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.779 
stainless steel over the the raised bits
of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.399> pendant<00:01:51.530> like<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.770> press<00:01:53.580> as<00:01:53.759> hard

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
of the pendant like this press as hard

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.000 
of the pendant like this press as hard
as<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.300> can

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.430 

and<00:02:00.690> keep<00:02:01.690> moving<00:02:02.260> it<00:02:02.380> round<00:02:02.620> so<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:02.980> you're

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
and keep moving it round so that you're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
and keep moving it round so that you're
doing<00:02:05.440> all<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.770> different<00:02:05.950> parts<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.760> it

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.890 

doesn't<00:02:12.180> matter<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:13.250> slides<00:02:14.250> off<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.490> edge

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
doesn't matter if it slides off the edge

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.330 
doesn't matter if it slides off the edge
because<00:02:15.900> you've<00:02:16.230> got<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.470> rubber<00:02:16.800> mat<00:02:17.040> there

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
because you've got the rubber mat there

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
because you've got the rubber mat there
to<00:02:18.500> stop<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.650
