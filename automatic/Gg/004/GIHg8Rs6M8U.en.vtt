00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
toivonen that's that's one thing i gotta

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.830 
toivonen that's that's one thing i gotta
worry<00:02:24.910> about<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.300> game<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.720> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
worry about in this game it's like a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.300 
worry about in this game it's like a
completely<00:02:26.230> different<00:02:26.350> style<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.950> Defense

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
completely different style of Defense

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.070 
completely different style of Defense
you<00:02:27.460> can't<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:27.760> attack<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.690> gotta<00:02:28.870> watch

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
you can't really attack you gotta watch

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.809 
you can't really attack you gotta watch
out<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:29.260> those<00:02:29.500> three<00:02:29.830> balls<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.340> Y<00:02:30.520> button

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
out for those three balls that Y button

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.580 
out for those three balls that Y button
that<00:02:31.000> through<00:02:31.210> bones<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.110> it'll<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.380> come

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that through bones it but it'll all come

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.290 
that through bones it but it'll all come
back<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.830> me<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.760> could<00:02:33.880> be<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> good

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
back to me I think it could be a good

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.200 
back to me I think it could be a good
series<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:34.990> um<00:02:35.230> but<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.100> definitely<00:02:36.819> think

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
series to do um but I definitely think

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.480 
series to do um but I definitely think
more<00:02:37.480> gameplay<00:02:37.810> than<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.590> GM<00:02:38.950> mode<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.400> know

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
more gameplay than the GM mode you know

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.280 
more gameplay than the GM mode you know
what<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> me<00:02:39.730> aur<00:02:39.880> manager<00:02:40.390> mode<00:02:40.540> maybe<00:02:40.990> someday

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
what I me aur manager mode maybe someday

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.500 
what I me aur manager mode maybe someday
in<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> future<00:02:41.740> but<00:02:42.100> yeah<00:02:42.370> man<00:02:42.640> fifa<00:02:43.000> 12<00:02:43.240> i
