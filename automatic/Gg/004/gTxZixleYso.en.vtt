00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
be able to record on the ps4 because it

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.330 
be able to record on the ps4 because it
has<00:00:14.929> hdcp<00:00:15.929> protection<00:00:16.529> if<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> don't<00:00:17.250> know

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.429 
has hdcp protection if you don't know
what<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.000> basically<00:00:18.439> protection

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
what it is it's basically protection

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
what it is it's basically protection
against<00:00:19.710> piracy<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.340> believe<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.449> will

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
against piracy I believe that you will

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.130 
against piracy I believe that you will
not<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.289> able<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.680> record<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.100> your<00:00:23.279> HDMI<00:00:24.140> well

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
not be able to record for your HDMI well

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.179 
not be able to record for your HDMI well
that's<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> reason<00:00:25.740> why<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.070> also

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that's the reason why you can also

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.150 
that's the reason why you can also
record<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.820> HDMI<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> ps3<00:00:28.160> because

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
record for your HDMI on the ps3 because

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.179 
record for your HDMI on the ps3 because
it's<00:00:29.310> only<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.730> blu-ray<00:00:30.119> players<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> xbox

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's only on blu-ray players the xbox

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's only on blu-ray players the xbox
360<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.510> still<00:00:33.780> record<00:00:34.170> through<00:00:34.680> hdmi

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
360 you can still record through hdmi

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.319 
360 you can still record through hdmi
because<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> does<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> blu-ray

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
because it does not have a blu-ray

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
because it does not have a blu-ray
player<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:39.260> fluid<00:00:40.260> systems<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.280> playstation

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
that uses hdmi like the later versions

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.810 
that uses hdmi like the later versions
because<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.110> old<00:01:46.259> person<00:01:46.590> did<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
because the old person did it and the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.429 
because the old person did it and the
ever<00:01:47.970> media<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.540> stuff<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.170> they

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
ever media and stuff like that so they

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.050 
ever media and stuff like that so they
should<00:01:49.680> work<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.159> those<00:01:50.340> capture<00:01:50.729> devices

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
should work with those capture devices

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
should work with those capture devices
so<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> first<00:01:51.840> method<00:01:52.140> I'm<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.710> show

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so the first method I'm going to show

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
so the first method I'm going to show
you<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> method<00:01:54.060> it's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
you it's not really a method it's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
you it's not really a method it's
actually<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.659> order<00:01:54.869> capture<00:01:55.229> card<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
actually an order capture card that

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.780 
actually an order capture card that
bypass<00:01:57.360> bypasses<00:01:58.350> hdcp<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> its<00:01:59.250> own<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
bypass bypasses hdcp on its own so you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
bypass bypasses hdcp on its own so you
don't<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.509> anything<00:02:00.840> else<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.560> get

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
don't have to do anything else just get

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.319 
don't have to do anything else just get
the<00:02:01.890> capture<00:02:02.219> card<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:02.880> work<00:02:02.909> like

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the capture card and it should work like

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.120 
the capture card and it should work like
that<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.409> confirmed<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:05.040> you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that it's this is confirmed if you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.429 
that it's this is confirmed if you
search<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.640> internet<00:02:05.700> i<00:02:06.240> found<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.290> on

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
search on the internet i found this on

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.869 
search on the internet i found this on
dealextreme<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.520> probably<00:02:08.759> find

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
dealextreme but you can probably find

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.969 
dealextreme but you can probably find

this all other websites on but on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.740 
this all other websites on but on
dealextreme<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.760> Olaf<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.690> I

dealextreme it's Olaf right now and I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.080 
dealextreme it's Olaf right now and I
don't

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
don't

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.430 
don't
no<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.390> going<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.660> get<00:02:13.840> back<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.200> stock

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
no what is going to get back in stock

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.170 
no what is going to get back in stock
but<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:14.980> searched<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.640> around<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
but I searched like around on the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.729 
but I searched like around on the
internet<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.750> found<00:02:16.780> some<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:17.440> places

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
internet and I found some more places

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.860 
internet and I found some more places
where<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.129> buy<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.480> gotta

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
where you can buy this so you just gotta

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.809 
where you can buy this so you just gotta
see<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.290> yourself<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.129> should<00:02:21.310> work<00:02:21.340> like

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
see for yourself but it should work like

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.839 
see for yourself but it should work like
that<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.769> second<00:02:24.099> method<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.430> an<00:02:24.550> actual

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
that so the second method is an actual

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.910 
that so the second method is an actual
method<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.840> requires<00:02:26.050> an<00:02:26.470> HDMI

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
method but this requires an HDMI

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.369 
method but this requires an HDMI
splitter<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:28.090> beware<00:02:28.269> there<00:02:28.660> are<00:02:28.810> only<00:02:28.989> some

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
splitter but beware there are only some

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.890 
splitter but beware there are only some
of<00:02:29.620> these<00:02:29.980> g-<00:02:30.940> mirrors<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.239> actually<00:02:31.690> work

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
of these g- mirrors that actually work

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.320 
of these g- mirrors that actually work
that<00:02:32.230> do<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.849> apparently<00:02:33.849> some<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.209> these

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
that do this apparently some of these

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.820 
that do this apparently some of these
hdmi<00:02:34.750> splitter<00:02:34.959> strip<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.830> hdcp<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.650> will

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
hdmi splitter strip the hdcp so you will

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.430 
hdmi splitter strip the hdcp so you will
be<00:02:38.860> able<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.310> record<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
be able to record like that so you the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.550 
be able to record like that so you the
cable<00:02:41.709> from<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.099> ps3<00:02:42.430> goes<00:02:43.000> or<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.420> ps4<00:02:43.690> goes

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
cable from the ps3 goes or the ps4 goes

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.740 
cable from the ps3 goes or the ps4 goes
to<00:02:44.860> or<00:02:45.190> actually<00:02:45.519> every<00:02:46.150> device<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.599> use

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
to or actually every device that use

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.350 
to or actually every device that use
hdcp<00:02:47.530> should<00:02:47.799> work<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.220> goes<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.209> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
hdcp should work like that goes to the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.479 
hdcp should work like that goes to the
splitter<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.620> one<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> cables

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
splitter and then the one of the cables

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.160 
splitter and then the one of the cables
goes<00:02:51.670> into<00:02:52.060> your<00:02:52.090> capture<00:02:52.420> device<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
goes into your capture device and the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.410 
goes into your capture device and the
other<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.500> goes<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.769> your<00:02:54.040> monitor<00:02:54.459> or<00:02:54.519> TV<00:02:55.000> r

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
other one goes to your monitor or TV r

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.069 
other one goes to your monitor or TV r
or<00:02:55.660> whatever<00:02:55.930> your<00:02:56.110> use<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:57.160> play<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.930> then

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
or whatever your use to play on and then

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.660 
or whatever your use to play on and then
it<00:02:59.230> should<00:02:59.379> still<00:02:59.709> work<00:02:59.769> like<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.310> because

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
it should still work like that because

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.809 
it should still work like that because
one<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.239> cables<00:03:01.690> will<00:03:02.260> lose<00:03:02.470> its<00:03:02.769> hdcp<00:03:03.670> or

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
one of the cables will lose its hdcp or

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.400 
one of the cables will lose its hdcp or
something<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.269> but<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.290> is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
something like that but this is

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.410 
something like that but this is
confirmed<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.890> work<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.489> will<00:03:06.879> link<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.239> guys

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.920 
this this is also the method that i
recommend<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.430> most<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.480> out<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.690> all<00:03:22.900> of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
recommend the most of out of all of

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.629 
recommend the most of out of all of
these<00:03:23.170> because<00:03:23.500> it's<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.889> cheapest<00:03:24.400> and

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
these because it's the cheapest and

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.460 
these because it's the cheapest and
probably<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.209> easiest<00:03:25.569> as<00:03:25.900> well<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.319> don't

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
probably the easiest as well and don't

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
probably the easiest as well and don't
have<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.739> buy<00:03:26.859> an<00:03:26.920> hour<00:03:27.069> capture<00:03:27.459> card<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:27.940> if

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
have to buy an hour capture card so if

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.530 
have to buy an hour capture card so if
you<00:03:29.079> don't<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.410> which<00:03:29.560> method<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.760> use<00:03:31.239> i

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
you don't know which method to to use i

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.720 
you don't know which method to to use i
would<00:03:31.780> use<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.200> one<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.310> third<00:03:33.519> method

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
would use this one so the third method

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.940 
would use this one so the third method
actually<00:03:34.120> also<00:03:34.660> requires<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.410> hdmi

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
actually also requires this hdmi

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.460 
actually also requires this hdmi
splitter<00:03:36.389> but<00:03:37.389> this<00:03:37.569> also<00:03:37.750> requires<00:03:37.989> other

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
splitter but this also requires other

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.559 
splitter but this also requires other
things<00:03:38.859> with<00:03:39.639> quite<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> lot<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.420> things

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
things with quite a lot of things

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.809 
things with quite a lot of things
actually<00:03:40.810> but<00:03:41.620> i'll<00:03:41.680> put<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:41.919> the<00:03:42.040> screen<00:03:42.400> like

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
actually but i'll put on the screen like

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.670 
actually but i'll put on the screen like
a<00:03:42.849> picture<00:03:43.480> tutorial<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.319> can<00:03:44.470> follow

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
a picture tutorial so you can follow

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.589 
a picture tutorial so you can follow
that<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.430> i<00:03:45.489> will<00:03:45.609> also<00:03:45.760> put<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.209> items<00:03:46.510> on

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
that and i will also put the items on

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.120 
that and i will also put the items on
the<00:03:46.660> screen<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.169> need<00:03:47.349> so<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.769> get<00:03:47.980> this

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
the screen that you need so to get this

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.430 
the screen that you need so to get this
method<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.579> work<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.450> cable<00:03:49.840> from<00:03:49.989> your<00:03:50.079> ps3

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
method to work the cable from your ps3

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.080 
method to work the cable from your ps3
or<00:03:50.739> ps4<00:03:51.150> goes<00:03:52.150> into<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.989> power<00:03:53.200> splitter<00:03:54.090> and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
or ps4 goes into the power splitter and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.390 
or ps4 goes into the power splitter and
one<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.569> outputs<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.560> splitter<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.250> is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
one of the outputs of the splitter it is

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.150 
one of the outputs of the splitter it is
also<00:03:57.609> a<00:03:57.730> power<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.209> hdmi<00:03:58.510> splitter<00:03:58.780> at<00:03:59.109> one<00:04:00.040> of

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
also a power to hdmi splitter at one of

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.530 
also a power to hdmi splitter at one of
the<00:04:00.220> outputs<00:04:00.549> goes<00:04:00.730> into<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.120> back<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.299> your

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
the outputs goes into the back of your

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.110 
the outputs goes into the back of your
TV<00:04:01.750> or<00:04:02.049> monitor<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.769> then<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.489> other<00:04:03.669> one<00:04:03.760> is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
TV or monitor and then the other one is

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.720 
TV or monitor and then the other one is
an<00:04:04.419> actual<00:04:04.660> hdmi<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.380> DVI<00:04:05.590> cable<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.549> put

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
an actual hdmi to DVI cable that you put

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.530 
an actual hdmi to DVI cable that you put
into<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.180> into<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.109> output<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:09.370> which<00:04:09.669> goes

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
into the into the output so which goes

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.520 
into the into the output so which goes
into<00:04:10.840> another<00:04:11.230> converter<00:04:11.829> box<00:04:12.299> which<00:04:13.530> which

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
into another converter box which which

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.909 
into another converter box which which
is<00:04:14.680> DVI<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.160> hdmi<00:04:15.970> again<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:17.289> box

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
is DVI to hdmi again and this box

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.449 
is DVI to hdmi again and this box
apparently<00:04:18.579> split<00:04:19.209> strips<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.229> hdcp<00:04:20.979> CL<00:04:21.340> as

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
apparently split strips the hdcp CL as

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.080 
apparently split strips the hdcp CL as
well<00:04:21.640> but<00:04:22.479> DVI<00:04:22.840> does<00:04:23.080> not<00:04:23.260> have<00:04:23.669> audio<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:25.030> you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
well but DVI does not have audio so you

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.110 
well but DVI does not have audio so you
will<00:04:25.330> need<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.510> toslink<00:04:25.960> cable<00:04:25.990> as<00:04:26.349> well

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
will need a toslink cable as well

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.279 
will need a toslink cable as well
when<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.180> go<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.419> also<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.840> this<00:04:28.900> converter

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
when you go is also in this converter

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.219 
when you go is also in this converter
box<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:30.099> you<00:04:30.159> will<00:04:30.400> have<00:04:30.430> audio<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.569> the<00:04:31.720> hdmi

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
box so you will have audio to the hdmi

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.670 
box so you will have audio to the hdmi
as<00:04:32.379> well<00:04:32.849> that's<00:04:33.849> gay<00:04:34.060> but<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:35.169> cable<00:04:35.530> art

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
as well that's gay but the cable art

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.320 
as well that's gay but the cable art
from<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.069> converter<00:04:36.490> box<00:04:36.729> goes<00:04:36.969> into<00:04:37.300> your

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
from the converter box goes into your

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.390 
from the converter box goes into your
capture<00:04:37.719> device<00:04:38.139> which<00:04:38.710> ever<00:04:38.919> one<00:04:39.099> you<00:04:39.129> have

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
capture device which ever one you have

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.159 
capture device which ever one you have
and<00:04:39.669> then<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.210> should<00:04:40.330> work<00:04:40.479> like<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.810> and

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
and then it should work like that and

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.689 
and then it should work like that and
this<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.830> second<00:04:42.250> method<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.639> i

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
this is the second method that i

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.610 
this is the second method that i
recommend<00:04:43.120> if<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.599> one<00:04:43.810> with<00:04:44.020> just<00:04:44.349> the<00:04:44.439> power

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
recommend if the one with just the power

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.290 
recommend if the one with just the power
hdmi<00:04:45.159> splitter<00:04:45.310> does<00:04:45.610> not<00:04:45.789> work<00:04:45.969> for<00:04:46.210> you

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
hdmi splitter does not work for you

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.170 
hdmi splitter does not work for you
before<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.199> last<00:04:47.469> method<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.979> actually<00:04:48.400> this

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
before the last method is actually this

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.230 
before the last method is actually this
device<00:04:49.719> that<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.139> called<00:04:50.379> the<00:04:50.560> HD<00:04:51.009> fury<00:04:51.340> but

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
device that is called the HD fury but

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.730 
device that is called the HD fury but
this<00:04:52.360> is<00:04:52.509> actually<00:04:52.689> pretty<00:04:53.199> damn<00:04:53.469> expensive

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
this is actually pretty damn expensive

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.939 
this is actually pretty damn expensive
it<00:04:54.189> costs<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.669> I<00:04:55.000> believe<00:04:55.680> over<00:04:56.680> two<00:04:56.860> hundred

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
it costs like I believe over two hundred

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.610 
it costs like I believe over two hundred
dollars<00:04:57.509> so<00:04:58.509> i<00:04:58.539> do<00:04:58.689> not<00:04:58.810> recommend<00:04:59.259> this<00:04:59.469> at

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
dollars so i do not recommend this at

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.219 
dollars so i do not recommend this at
all<00:04:59.800> but<00:05:00.129> i<00:05:00.159> guess<00:05:00.520> if<00:05:00.789> nothing<00:05:01.599> worse<00:05:01.780> for<00:05:01.810> you

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
all but i guess if nothing worse for you

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.659 
all but i guess if nothing worse for you
this<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.710> last<00:05:02.949> thing<00:05:03.190> you<00:05:03.340> can<00:05:03.370> do

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
this is the last thing you can do

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.939 
this is the last thing you can do
probably<00:05:04.000> but<00:05:04.960> i<00:05:04.990> still<00:05:05.289> do<00:05:05.440> not<00:05:05.530> recommend

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
probably but i still do not recommend

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.610 
probably but i still do not recommend
this<00:05:06.250> at<00:05:06.430> all<00:05:06.580> actually<00:05:06.849> so<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.509> but<00:05:08.409> if<00:05:08.500> you

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
this at all actually so on but if you
