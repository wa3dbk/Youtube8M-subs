00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
million and turning it into

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.770 
million and turning it into
1,000,000,000<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.969> flipping<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
1,000,000,000 just with flipping and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
1,000,000,000 just with flipping and
it's<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.350> recorded<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.070> my

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it's all going to be recorded and my

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
it's all going to be recorded and my

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.420 
progress will be shown every week or so
and<00:00:38.930> eventually<00:00:39.930> i<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.350> hit<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.710> mark<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.219> 1

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.130 
and eventually i will hit my mark of 1
billion<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.059> obviously<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> long<00:00:42.780> term

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
billion so it's obviously a long term

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.729 
billion so it's obviously a long term
goal<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.160> will<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.430> soon<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
goal but we will get there soon so I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.040

start to panic put it back in for the
price<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.619> bought<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> lost<00:01:47.579> safer

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
price you bought it it's a lost safer

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.380 
price you bought it it's a lost safer
just<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> lose<00:01:49.259> 15<00:01:49.799> minutes<00:01:50.159> worth<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.640> waiting

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
just to lose 15 minutes worth of waiting

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.350 
just to lose 15 minutes worth of waiting
rather<00:01:52.200> than<00:01:52.409> losing<00:01:53.100> money<00:01:53.340> trying<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
rather than losing money trying to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
rather than losing money trying to
constantly<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> profit<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.009> just

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
constantly get a profit that you just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.749 
constantly get a profit that you just
won't<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.950> because<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:59.130> admin<00:01:59.520> bars

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
won't get and because my admin bars

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.270 
won't get and because my admin bars
turned<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.689> pretty<00:02:00.719> much<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.500> flop<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
turned out to be pretty much a flop I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.889 
turned out to be pretty much a flop I
decided<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> move<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
decided that I'm going to move on to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.749 
decided that I'm going to move on to
bigger<00:02:04.229> items<00:02:04.530> maybe<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.310> something<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
bigger items maybe that's something I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700 
bigger items maybe that's something I
might<00:02:05.909> specialize<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.540> doing<00:02:06.990> bigger<00:02:07.439> items

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
might specialize in doing bigger items

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.369 
might specialize in doing bigger items
I've<00:02:08.640> never<00:02:08.849> had<00:02:09.149> much<00:02:09.390> luck<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:09.989> some<00:02:10.110> reason

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
I've never had much luck for some reason

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.760 
I've never had much luck for some reason
doing<00:02:10.560> small<00:02:10.830> items

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
doing small items

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.200 
doing small items
maybe<00:02:12.100> it's<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> smaller<00:02:13.000> items

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
maybe it's because the smaller items

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.630 
maybe it's because the smaller items
have<00:02:13.720> thousands<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.830> thousands<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.460> players

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
have thousands of thousands of players

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.120 
have thousands of thousands of players
going<00:02:16.540> into<00:02:16.900> them<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> bigger

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
going into them and with the bigger

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.070 
going into them and with the bigger
items<00:02:18.370> obviously<00:02:19.090> there's<00:02:19.270> still<00:02:19.360> thousands

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
items obviously there's still thousands

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.100 
items obviously there's still thousands
of<00:02:20.200> players<00:02:20.380> doing<00:02:20.770> them<00:02:21.210> there's<00:02:22.210> just<00:02:22.510> less

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
of players doing them there's just less

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.010 
of players doing them there's just less
of<00:02:23.320> them<00:02:23.770> or<00:02:24.130> less<00:02:24.460> people<00:02:24.790> doing<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:25.390> maybe

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
of them or less people doing it so maybe

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.870 
of them or less people doing it so maybe
it<00:02:26.410> might<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.650> best<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.640> five

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
it might be best if you have five

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.820 
it might be best if you have five
million<00:02:28.150> maybe<00:02:28.660> go<00:02:28.810> straightened<00:02:29.320> for<00:02:29.710> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
million maybe go straightened for the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.670 
million maybe go straightened for the
