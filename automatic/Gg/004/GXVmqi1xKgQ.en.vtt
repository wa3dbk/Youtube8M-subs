00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
dominant chord D in this case and then

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270 
dominant chord D in this case and then
back<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:27.780> blues<00:01:28.500> progressions<00:01:29.160> and

the<00:06:06.189> time<00:06:06.399> is<00:06:06.729> that<00:06:06.759> so<00:06:07.210> seven<00:06:07.629> two<00:06:07.930> seven<00:06:08.259> five

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
the time is that so seven two seven five

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.689 
the time is that so seven two seven five
seven<00:06:09.159> one<00:06:09.520> more<00:06:09.969> progression<00:06:10.539> and<00:06:11.499> so<00:06:12.129> how<00:06:12.639> do

seven one more progression and so how do

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.939 
seven one more progression and so how do
you<00:06:12.879> play<00:06:13.180> over<00:06:13.629> those<00:06:13.809> that<00:06:14.229> those<00:06:14.619> chord

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
you play over those that those chord

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.070 
you play over those that those chord
changes<00:06:15.009> there<00:06:15.729> if<00:06:15.909> you<00:06:16.029> just<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.629> each<00:06:16.930> of

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
changes there if you just the each of

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.859 
changes there if you just the each of
those<00:06:17.229> courts<00:06:17.770> has<00:06:18.520> notes<00:06:18.909> that<00:06:19.180> are<00:06:19.300> not<00:06:19.539> in

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
in the key of G so what do you do well

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:39.929 
in the key of G so what do you do well
here<00:06:37.089> we<00:06:37.270> are<00:06:37.300> studying<00:06:38.279> dominant<00:06:39.279> chords<00:06:39.669> and

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:39.939 
here we are studying dominant chords and

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:41.699 
here we are studying dominant chords and
so<00:06:40.240> if<00:06:40.569> you<00:06:40.749> think<00:06:40.779> there's<00:06:41.110> a<00:06:41.229> logical

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:41.709 
so if you think there's a logical

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:43.529 
so if you think there's a logical
progression<00:06:42.309> to<00:06:42.430> what<00:06:42.550> I'm<00:06:42.669> presenting<00:06:42.909> here

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
progression to what I'm presenting here

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.469 
progression to what I'm presenting here
you<00:06:43.990> might<00:06:44.229> think<00:06:44.559> say<00:06:45.069> a<00:06:45.369> bet<00:06:45.909> you<00:06:46.059> could<00:06:46.270> play

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
you might think say a bet you could play

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.649 
you might think say a bet you could play
the<00:06:46.830> dominant<00:06:47.830> scale<00:06:48.129> of<00:06:48.459> the<00:06:48.639> same<00:06:48.849> root<00:06:49.240> over

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
the dominant scale of the same root over

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.959 
the dominant scale of the same root over
each<00:06:50.169> of<00:06:50.379> those<00:06:50.499> chords<00:06:51.039> in<00:06:51.159> that<00:06:51.279> cycle<00:06:51.759> of

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969 
each of those chords in that cycle of

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:54.269 
each of those chords in that cycle of
dominant<00:06:52.479> seventh<00:06:53.019> chords<00:06:53.469> and<00:06:53.620> you<00:06:54.039> would<00:06:54.159> be

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:54.279 
dominant seventh chords and you would be

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.980 
dominant seventh chords and you would be
exactly<00:06:54.639> right<00:06:54.849> that<00:06:55.389> is<00:06:55.539> sort<00:06:55.749> of<00:06:55.839> the

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
exactly right that is sort of the

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.159 
exactly right that is sort of the
textbook<00:06:56.469> way<00:06:57.009> of<00:06:57.659> playing<00:06:58.659> over<00:06:59.019> those

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
textbook way of playing over those

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.179 
textbook way of playing over those
chords<00:06:59.769> and<00:07:00.129> so<00:07:00.789> using<00:07:01.360> the<00:07:01.649> six<00:07:02.649> seven<00:07:02.979> two

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:03.189 
chords and so using the six seven two

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.999
