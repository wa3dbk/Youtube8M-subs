00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
question I get asked that an awful lot

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.539 
question I get asked that an awful lot
yeah<00:01:23.659> well<00:01:24.109> first<00:01:24.409> of<00:01:24.619> my<00:01:24.740> response<00:01:25.189> is<00:01:25.399> we're

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
yeah well first of my response is we're

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.670 
yeah well first of my response is we're
not<00:01:25.670> in<00:01:25.850> competition<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.750> leaf<00:01:26.960> our

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
not in competition with the leaf our

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.950 
not in competition with the leaf our
view<00:01:28.039> at<00:01:28.189> we<00:01:28.340> go<00:01:28.549> is<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.060> market<00:01:29.659> demand

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
view at we go is that the market demand

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.590 
view at we go is that the market demand
right<00:01:30.229> now<00:01:30.259> is<00:01:31.009> about<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.490> million<00:01:31.969> units<00:01:32.329> in

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
right now is about a million units in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.800 
right now is about a million units in
the<00:01:33.289> US<00:01:33.439> this<00:01:34.250> year<00:01:34.729> if<00:01:34.909> v's<00:01:35.299> were<00:01:35.509> available

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
the US this year if v's were available

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.679 
the US this year if v's were available
so<00:01:36.289> we<00:01:36.920> use<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.250> analogy<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.909> iPod<00:01:38.450> with

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
so we use the analogy of the iPod with

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.529 
so we use the analogy of the iPod with
Apple<00:01:39.109> before<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.890> iPod<00:01:40.280> came<00:01:40.640> out<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.390> was

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
Apple before the iPod came out it was

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.450 
Apple before the iPod came out it was
hard<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.810> estimate<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.829> market<00:01:43.310> was

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
hard to estimate what the market was

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.580 
hard to estimate what the market was
because<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.999> private<00:01:44.420> product<00:01:44.869> didn't<00:01:45.229> exist

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
because the private product didn't exist

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.950 
because the private product didn't exist
once<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.579> product<00:01:46.969> hit<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> market<00:01:47.689> it

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
once the product hit the market it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.050 
once the product hit the market it
exploded<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:49.219> feel<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.579> same<00:01:49.759> way<00:01:49.939> about

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
exploded we feel the same way about

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.719 
exploded we feel the same way about
electric<00:01:50.600> cars<00:01:50.740> once<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:52.249> we<00:01:52.399> know<00:01:52.549> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
electric cars once that we know the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.330 
electric cars once that we know the
market<00:01:52.969> is<00:01:53.149> there<00:01:53.780> what's<00:01:54.499> been<00:01:54.710> lacking<00:01:54.979> is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
market is there what's been lacking is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.190 
market is there what's been lacking is
the<00:01:55.369> product<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.509> we're<00:01:56.719> really<00:01:56.840> not<00:01:57.109> in

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
the product so we're really not in

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.679 
the product so we're really not in
competition<00:01:57.439> with<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> Nissan<00:01:58.399> Leaf<00:01:58.479> we<00:01:59.479> don't

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.149

front of the car are the controller
which<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.819> actually<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.300> computer

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
which is actually the computer

which is actually the computer
that<00:02:15.150> runs<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.570> car<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.920> motor<00:02:17.280> controller

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that runs the car so a motor controller

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.030 
that runs the car so a motor controller
in<00:02:18.240> an<00:02:18.390> electric<00:02:18.840> car<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> laptop

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
in an electric car is like a laptop

in an electric car is like a laptop
computer<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:21.030> fact<00:02:21.300> if<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.600> opened<00:02:21.960> up<00:02:22.050> our

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
computer in fact if you opened up our

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.900 
computer in fact if you opened up our
controller<00:02:22.590> box<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.580> would<00:02:23.670> look<00:02:23.880> just

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
controller box it would look just

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.270 
controller box it would look just
exactly<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.870> black<00:02:25.230> laptop<00:02:25.800> computer

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
exactly like a black laptop computer

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.250 
exactly like a black laptop computer
that<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.730> ordered<00:02:27.000> from<00:02:27.120> Dell<00:02:27.360> our

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that you just ordered from Dell our

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.010 
that you just ordered from Dell our
secret<00:02:28.830> sauce<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.100> our<00:02:29.580> car<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.510> software

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
secret sauce for our car is the software

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.620 
secret sauce for our car is the software
that<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.530> write<00:02:31.740> into<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.220> controller<00:02:32.670> so

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
that we write into that controller so

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.540 
that we write into that controller so
it's<00:02:33.780> our<00:02:34.020> software<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.920> makes<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.310> car

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
it's our software that makes the car

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.090 
it's our software that makes the car
special<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.810> happens<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> two-seater

special this happens to be a two-seater

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580 
special this happens to be a two-seater
by<00:02:38.340> design<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:39.810> wanted<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.400 
by design and we wanted it to be a
two-seater<00:02:41.240> because<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.600> think<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.080> range

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
two-seater because we think that range

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.360 
two-seater because we think that range
is<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.990> critical<00:02:45.990> elements<00:02:46.370> to

adoption if we provided this car at
$30,000<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.410> got<00:02:55.530> fifty<00:02:55.740> miles<00:02:56.070> per

why<00:03:11.640> did<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.820> guys<00:03:11.970> choose<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.540> over<00:03:12.600> like

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
why did you guys choose that over like

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.000 
why did you guys choose that over like
well<00:03:14.540> well<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.500> because<00:03:16.830> it's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
well well we really like it because it's

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.420 
well well we really like it because it's
safe<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:18.270> runs<00:03:18.660> cool<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.680> there's<00:03:19.950> very<00:03:20.190> little

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
safe it runs cool so there's very little

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.660 
safe it runs cool so there's very little
heat<00:03:20.730> buildup<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.350> because<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.459> you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
heat buildup and and because of that you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.030 
heat buildup and and because of that you
don't<00:03:23.700> need<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.030> cooling<00:03:24.890> mechanism<00:03:25.890> it's

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
don't need a cooling mechanism it's

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
don't need a cooling mechanism it's
air-cooled<00:03:26.520> rather<00:03:26.880> than<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> water<00:03:27.390> or<00:03:27.600> liquid

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
air-cooled rather than a water or liquid

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.900 
air-cooled rather than a water or liquid
cool<00:03:29.330> it's<00:03:30.330> relatively<00:03:31.260> low-cost<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.220> it's

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
cool it's relatively low-cost and it's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.479 
cool it's relatively low-cost and it's
plentiful<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.470> cars<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.890> right<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.250> cars

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
plentiful so the cars on right now cars

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:44.140 
plentiful so the cars on right now cars
on<00:03:35.730> okay<00:03:36.090> you're<00:03:36.390> good<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.600> go<00:03:36.660> let's<00:03:36.870> go

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.080 

yeah<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.989> little<00:03:45.200> bit<00:03:45.290> more<00:03:45.620> noise<00:03:45.920> than

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
yeah it's a little bit more noise than

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.039 
yeah it's a little bit more noise than
the<00:03:47.090> other<00:03:47.239> electric<00:03:47.810> vehicles<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.409> given

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
the other electric vehicles so given

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.809 
the other electric vehicles so given
yeah<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.260> feels<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:52.040> pink<00:03:52.280> city<00:03:52.489> it

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
yeah it feels like the pink city it

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.530 
yeah it feels like the pink city it
feels<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.209> little<00:03:53.569> bit<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:54.909> little<00:03:57.280> jumpy<00:03:58.540> how

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
feels a little bit a little jumpy how

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.190 
feels a little bit a little jumpy how
would<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.780> say<00:04:01.540> yeah<00:04:02.540> it's<00:04:02.720> not<00:04:02.840> exactly

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
would you say yeah it's not exactly

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.149 
would you say yeah it's not exactly
smooth<00:04:03.849> that's<00:04:04.849> for<00:04:05.030> sure

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
smooth that's for sure

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.330 
smooth that's for sure
not<00:04:07.849> smooth<00:04:08.150> enough<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.659> for<00:04:09.220> compared<00:04:10.220> to

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
not smooth enough to for compared to

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.649 
not smooth enough to for compared to
like<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.640> leaf<00:04:10.819> or<00:04:11.030> something<00:04:11.150> which<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
like the leaf or something which is the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:18.509 
like the leaf or something which is the
same<00:04:11.959> price<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.910> it's<00:04:17.419> pretty<00:04:17.630> small<00:04:17.870> also

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
same price and it's pretty small also

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.590 
same price and it's pretty small also
obviously<00:04:19.519> because<00:04:19.729> it's<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.940> two-seater<00:04:20.299> but

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
obviously because it's a two-seater but

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.300 
obviously because it's a two-seater but
it<00:04:20.690> also<00:04:20.810> feels<00:04:21.199> a<00:04:24.130> little<00:04:25.130> bit<00:04:25.310> crammed

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
it also feels a little bit crammed
