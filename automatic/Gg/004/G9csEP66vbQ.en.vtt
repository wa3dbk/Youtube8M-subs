00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 hello my name is fernando I'm in charge 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.870
 for manufacturing products and today 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.119
 I'm here to demonstrate the correct 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 way of using the April dry lava 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.170
 because I wash to be when April is a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.930
 innovative product in a wash 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.890
 conventionally spent around 380 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 liters of water 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.109
 already with April dry lava is not used 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.700
 nor a drop a common doubt that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.329
 product for dry cleaning risk 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.640
 dry lava vehicle in April is not as 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 in its formulation oliveros that are 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
 thrill with dust particles 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 so that they do not risk beyond 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 of carnauba wax and silicone 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.860
 brightness and protection in search of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.559
 Your car that takes about April is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 composed of the product and three 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.520
 microfiber being the first plan for the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 application of the product, the second 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.079
 and the third for finalization 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.589
 the correct way of using the power of 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.380
 microfiber is to fold or double in order to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:13.320
 to get 8 easy to clean 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.270
 one two three four and the other four 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 on the opposite side the washing process 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 to dry resembles the conventional 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.439
 should always start from the ceiling 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 then hood and finally the parts 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.930
 lowers the index accumulates more dirt 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.030
 heavy 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 it is also important to make sure that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.820
 the car is shade and the cold body 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.329
 so let's go and get some product before 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.780
 use 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.130
 then always apply directly to the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.119
 cloth starting from the ceiling with movements 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.000
 small circular areas at a time and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.760
 before drying 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.940
 clean another dry cloth to remove the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.940
 product 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 the leads to be turned bill can be 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.509
 used on all types of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.909
 surface is not white when 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.909
 plastic rubbers or adhesives 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.340
 in the lower parts where the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 Most of the dirt is 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.730
 look a little more and with movements 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.200
 remove excess in dirt 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.610
 heavy then 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.820
 Search is the most clean face cloth and 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.140
 repeats the initial movement process 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.600
 circular 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.610
 the April dry lava kit can be 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.150
