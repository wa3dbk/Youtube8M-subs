charge<00:04:50.100> or<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.190> could<00:04:51.400> just<00:04:51.430> go<00:04:51.639> ahead<00:04:51.760> and

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
charge or I could just go ahead and

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.930 
charge or I could just go ahead and
fully<00:04:52.720> delete<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.410> project<00:04:53.979> page<00:04:54.190> which<00:04:54.910> is

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
fully delete the project page which is

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.469 
fully delete the project page which is
going<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.540> remove<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.320> connection<00:04:56.800> between

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
going to remove the connection between

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.710 
going to remove the connection between
concrete5<00:04:58.479> org<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.169> your<00:04:59.740> own<00:04:59.889> website<00:05:00.720> so

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
concrete5 org and your own website so

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.790 
concrete5 org and your own website so
that's<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.930> easiest<00:05:02.320> way<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.620> install

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
that's the easiest way to install

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.490 
that's the easiest way to install
add-ons<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.000> themes<00:05:04.240> it's<00:05:04.840> not<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.050> only<00:05:05.229> way

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
add-ons and themes it's not the only way

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.950 
add-ons and themes it's not the only way
you<00:05:05.560> can<00:05:05.740> do<00:05:05.889> it<00:05:06.010> manually<00:05:06.310> as<00:05:06.580> well<00:05:06.960> but

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
you can do it manually as well but

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.450 
you can do it manually as well but
certainly<00:05:08.139> this<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.710> simplest<00:05:08.950> way<00:05:09.220> to

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
certainly this is the simplest way to

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.050 
certainly this is the simplest way to
extend<00:05:10.090> your<00:05:10.270> concrete5<00:05:10.780> site
