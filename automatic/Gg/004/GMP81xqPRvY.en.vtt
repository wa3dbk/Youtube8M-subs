 let's move on to the procedure first 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 Let's talk about hazelnuts in a mixer 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 getting almost a powder and with 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 some larger pieces and then one 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.729
 bowl we're going to put the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.590
 dry ingredients 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.869
 so we have the flour to which 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.560
 add the sugar then the half 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.560
 yeast sachet 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.580
 mix a little to mix 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.799
 so let's move on to the other bowl where 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.119
 we will go instead to put the ingredients 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.600
 liquids then the two eggs or milk e 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600
 melted butter 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.030
 we mix here too from valga mare 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 all the components 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.369
 we can then two liquid ingredients 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.240
 and dry stirring until 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.009
 achievement of a homogeneous compound 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.160
 eventually it is too thick 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.229
 we can add a dash of milk 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:17.940
 at this point we can also add 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:20.610

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.680

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.340
