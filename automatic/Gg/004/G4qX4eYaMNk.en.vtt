it's<00:02:39.250> made<00:02:39.490> with<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.760> 6<00:02:40.120> inch<00:02:40.330> LED<00:02:41.170> display

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
it's made with the 6 inch LED display

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.980 
it's made with the 6 inch LED display
it's<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.890> plastic<00:02:42.430> coil<00:02:42.640> ed<00:02:42.910> display<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.840> it's

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
it's a plastic coil ed display so it's

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.590 
it's a plastic coil ed display so it's
actually<00:02:44.110> bendable<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:44.890> shatterproof<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.480> if

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
actually bendable and shatterproof so if

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.180 
actually bendable and shatterproof so if
you<00:02:46.750> were<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> take<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.410> spoon<00:02:47.680> right<00:02:47.950> now

you were to take this spoon right now

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.930 
you were to take this spoon right now
you<00:02:48.250> see<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.700> curvature

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
you see the curvature

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.090 
you see the curvature
the<00:02:50.360> curvature<00:02:50.810> actually<00:02:51.230> will<00:02:51.380> match<00:02:51.590> some

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
the curvature actually will match some

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.860

angles that light board towards your

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.500 
angles that light board towards your
eyes<00:03:24.530> also<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:25.490> you're<00:03:25.670> talking<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.270> phone

mouth and the rear speaker is located on
the<00:03:31.100> back<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.610> we've<00:03:31.730> been<00:03:31.850> good<00:03:32.060> at<00:03:32.240> sitting

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
the back so we've been good at sitting

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.020 
the back so we've been good at sitting
down<00:03:32.840> it'll<00:03:33.590> actually<00:03:33.770> deflect<00:03:34.490> out<00:03:34.730> there

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
down it'll actually deflect out there

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.620 
down it'll actually deflect out there
and<00:03:35.240> it's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
and it's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.090 
and it's
ergonomics<00:03:37.630> when<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.900> feel<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.350> flexibility

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
ergonomics when I feel that flexibility

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.010 
ergonomics when I feel that flexibility
that<00:03:39.370> gives<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.910> flexibility<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.720> have

multitasking it's been to the south of
us<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.120> she<00:04:01.180> said<00:04:01.480> Oh<00:04:01.600> monitor<00:04:02.080> what<00:04:02.350> it's

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
us and so she said Oh monitor what it's

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.850 
us and so she said Oh monitor what it's
ginormous<00:04:03.720> my<00:04:04.720> general<00:04:05.080> understanding<00:04:05.680> is

ginormous my general understanding is

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.340 
ginormous my general understanding is
that<00:04:05.890> curved<00:04:06.370> screens<00:04:06.880> as<00:04:07.210> expected<00:04:07.750> don't

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
that curved screens as expected don't

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.230 
that curved screens as expected don't
really<00:04:08.680> give<00:04:08.860> me<00:04:08.980> much<00:04:09.010> more<00:04:09.220> just<00:04:09.730> big<00:04:10.030> words
