00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:33.029 
ridiculous if they were illegal they

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:34.819 
ridiculous if they were illegal they

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.850 
would have Game of Thrones which they do
not<00:07:35.990> because<00:07:36.990> they<00:07:37.019> can't<00:07:37.169> get<00:07:37.409> the<00:07:37.499> license

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
not because they can't get the license

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.469 
not because they can't get the license
for<00:07:38.099> it<00:07:38.189> they<00:07:38.459> do<00:07:38.519> have<00:07:38.729> licenses<00:07:39.269> for<00:07:39.389> all

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479
