00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
if we pull it forward just a little bit

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.499 
if we pull it forward just a little bit
here<00:01:27.330> we'll<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.680> still<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> good<00:01:30.360> level

here we'll see I'm still at a good level

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
here we'll see I'm still at a good level
I've<00:01:30.780> got<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.799> ball<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.310> ahead<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> ball

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I've got the ball I'm ahead of the ball

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.359 
I've got the ball I'm ahead of the ball
right<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> number<00:01:34.259> 10<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.130> there

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
right now with this number 10 but there

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.850 
right now with this number 10 but there
is<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.880> least<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.540> defender<00:01:37.079> between<00:01:37.530> myself

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
is at least one defender between myself

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.109 
is at least one defender between myself
and<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> goal<00:01:38.729> along<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.020> goalie<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
and the goal along with the goalie and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.389 
and the goal along with the goalie and
once<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.479> ball<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.750> passed<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.979> player

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
once the ball is passed to my player

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.020 
once the ball is passed to my player
then<00:01:45.390> he<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.049> run<00:01:46.350> behind<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.490> defense

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
then he can run behind the defense

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.590 
then he can run behind the defense
towards<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> goal<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
towards the goal to go for this for the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
towards the goal to go for this for the
goal<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.740> play<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.340> bit

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
goal and so if we play it a little bit

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.649 
goal and so if we play it a little bit
forward<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.479> you'll<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.860> am<00:01:56.460> still<00:01:57.060> if

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
