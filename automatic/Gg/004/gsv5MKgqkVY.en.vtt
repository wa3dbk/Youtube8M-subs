it is a Snapdragon s4 pro apq8064

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.939 
it is a Snapdragon s4 pro apq8064
quad-core<00:00:20.640> chip<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:22.230> know<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.710> usual

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
quad-core chip so you know the usual

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250 
quad-core chip so you know the usual
package<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.510> we've<00:00:24.689> already<00:00:24.840> seen<00:00:25.080> from

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
package that we've already seen from

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.439 
package that we've already seen from
various<00:00:25.619> other<00:00:25.740> brands<00:00:26.010> such<00:00:26.130> as<00:00:26.189> HTC<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
various other brands such as HTC and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.349 
various other brands such as HTC and
Oppo<00:00:27.949> but<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.279> makes<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.730> different<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
Oppo but what makes it different is that

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.139 
Oppo but what makes it different is that
it's<00:00:30.689> actually<00:00:31.219> even<00:00:32.219> slimmer<00:00:32.790> than<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it's actually even slimmer than a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
it's actually even slimmer than a
butterfly<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.520> Oppo<00:00:35.520> find<00:00:35.969> 5<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.980> guys

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
butterfly and Oppo find 5 so you guys

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.380 
butterfly and Oppo find 5 so you guys
probably<00:00:38.309> can't<00:00:38.550> see<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
probably can't see it here but it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
probably can't see it here but it
certainly<00:00:39.750> beats<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.980> even<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.370> on

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
certainly beats it and it's even got on

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.450 
certainly beats it and it's even got on
a<00:00:41.850> narrower<00:00:42.420> bezel<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.230> well<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.860> beating<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a narrower bezel as well and beating the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.569 
a narrower bezel as well and beating the
other<00:00:44.489> five<00:00:44.879> inch<00:00:45.120> phones<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.430> enough<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
other five inch phones and enough of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.729 
other five inch phones and enough of
that<00:00:47.610> let's<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> quick<00:00:48.780> tour<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.410> you

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that let's just do a quick tour so you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
that let's just do a quick tour so you
can<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.190> there's<00:00:50.430> an<00:00:50.579> EPS<00:00:50.940> grill<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> top

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
can see there's an EPS grill at the top

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
can see there's an EPS grill at the top
as<00:00:52.110> usual<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> down<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149

slightly different to most other
androids<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.730> instead<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> usual

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
androids here so instead of the usual
