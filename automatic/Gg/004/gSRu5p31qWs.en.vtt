00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.989
 August 26 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.910
 for me it's really a return to 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.769
 roots since I come back to the music 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 who makes me really happy 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.220
 that is to say folk and reggae with 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.220
 with brass 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.520
 at the ankle 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.440
 I was not looking I was not expecting anything 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.450
 do not see further from them 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.290
 I know happiness 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.790
 what days 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.390
 one day 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.320
 m 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 I have little surfait we will say during in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.100
 2009 2010 2011 then there I was lucky 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.989
 of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.290
 to be able to go to Indonesia from the side 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.800
 Ben Ali and Timor to discover 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.860
 spots 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.480
 virgin and leave with friends on a 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.840
 sailboat like that during 11 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.230
 days 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.910
 we did a lot of waves we are 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.400
 returned with one with a beautiful movie is 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.390
 beautiful picture of good memories and then to 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 you will see all this in october 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.560
 with surf session since the movie 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.940
 will be released in October 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.210
 I can not say that I prefer surfing 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.520
 to music or music to wizards 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.460
 for me it's so complementary 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.640
 at the base I was competing 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.500
 in surf and now I can over 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.700
 competitions in surfing bread I go out 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.369
 really for fun and that's my 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
 outlet par excellence so the music 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.400
 became professional then 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.619
 before that it was the opposite I did 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.880
 surfing comets and I was playing the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.890
 music to change my ideas 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.670
 now I make music I serve 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 Frank to change ideas 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:14.650
 I did not want to stay in the girl 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.459
 wait for my turn to all that life 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.360
 the one I imagine here my dreams 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:28.090
 will not become one of those I'm leaving 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.390
 today and if you are already and 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.519
 but I do not care, I prefer 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.120
 fed on the crowd 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:48.560
 I prefer to see me 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:54.849
 and I do not care I prefer I do not care 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.849
 prefer I prefer but noah
