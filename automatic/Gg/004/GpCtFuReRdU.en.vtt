00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
doesn't get confusing with compound

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.319

inflation<00:00:39.989> over<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.180> going

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
inflation over time so this is all going

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
well you multiply that by 30 no there's

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.610 
well you multiply that by 30 no there's
going<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.620> be<00:05:15.710> some<00:05:16.040> growth<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.700> we<00:05:17.180> are

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
like four point five percent so I'm

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.590 
like four point five percent so I'm
going<00:05:36.620> low<00:05:36.860> here<00:05:37.220> at<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.550> three<00:05:37.790> percent<00:05:38.150> return

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
going low here at a three percent return

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.620 
going low here at a three percent return
over<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.530> period<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.980> time<00:05:40.250> our<00:05:40.640> multiplier<00:05:41.270> is

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
over a period of time our multiplier is

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.120 
over a period of time our multiplier is
22<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.610> 22<00:05:44.330> times<00:05:44.690> whatever<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.710> need<00:05:45.890> per

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
22 so 22 times whatever you need per

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.290 
22 so 22 times whatever you need per
year<00:05:46.370> is<00:05:46.490> what<00:05:46.520> your

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
savings is going to need to be so that

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.190

other expenses that we're not including
here<00:06:38.480> but<00:06:38.630> this<00:06:38.780> is<00:06:38.930> just<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.200> average<00:06:39.410> and<00:06:39.860> it

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
here but this is just the average and it

here but this is just the average and it
shows<00:06:40.190> you<00:06:40.340> the<00:06:40.460> math<00:06:40.730> how<00:06:41.150> to<00:06:41.210> figure<00:06:41.660> it<00:06:41.810> out

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
shows you the math how to figure it out

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.170 
shows you the math how to figure it out
that's<00:06:42.530> the<00:06:42.680> key<00:06:42.980> thing<00:06:43.340> what's<00:06:43.610> involved<00:06:44.090> in

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
that's the key thing what's involved in

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.080 
that's the key thing what's involved in
figuring<00:06:44.390> out<00:06:44.720> how<00:06:44.930> much<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.320> need<00:06:45.530> now<00:06:46.400> this

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
2 million dollars is in 2014 dollars it

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.810 
2 million dollars is in 2014 dollars it
has<00:06:50.630> to<00:06:50.930> be<00:06:51.020> indexed<00:06:51.560> up<00:06:51.710> every<00:06:52.010> year<00:06:52.040> so<00:06:52.730> if

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
has to be indexed up every year so if

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.640

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.130 
like to talk about inflation but what's
a<00:06:58.550> target<00:06:58.940> number<00:06:59.060> I<00:06:59.180> should<00:06:59.270> really<00:06:59.630> hit<00:06:59.780> 4

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.140 
a target number I should really hit 4

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.070 
a target number I should really hit 4
well<00:07:00.860> at<00:07:00.980> 3%<00:07:01.730> inflation<00:07:01.850> per<00:07:02.480> year<00:07:02.780> at<00:07:02.900> just

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
well at 3% inflation per year at just

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.320 
well at 3% inflation per year at just
about<00:07:03.290> doubles<00:07:03.740> after<00:07:04.070> 20<00:07:04.400> years<00:07:04.430> so<00:07:05.270> 2

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
about doubles after 20 years so 2

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.180 
about doubles after 20 years so 2
million<00:07:05.780> dollars<00:07:06.050> today<00:07:06.230> will<00:07:06.470> be<00:07:06.590> 4<00:07:06.860> million

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
million dollars today will be 4 million

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.950 
million dollars today will be 4 million
in<00:07:07.340> 20<00:07:07.610> years<00:07:07.820> or<00:07:08.060> about<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.270> million<00:07:08.690> and<00:07:08.870> a

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
in 20 years or about a million and a

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.260 
in 20 years or about a million and a
half

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
half

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.900
