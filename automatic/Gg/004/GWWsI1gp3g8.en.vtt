part of it is the fob aspect where
you're<00:01:53.679> you<00:01:54.039> know<00:01:54.160> able<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.520> lock<00:01:54.729> immediately

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
you're you know able to lock immediately

from<00:01:55.599> anywhere<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.110> classroom<00:01:56.619> just<00:01:57.069> by

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
from anywhere in the classroom just by

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.800 
from anywhere in the classroom just by
the<00:01:57.280> touch<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.759> button<00:01:57.910> before<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.509> had<00:01:58.630> some

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
the touch of a button before we had some

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.949 
the touch of a button before we had some
locks<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.319> were<00:01:59.819> didn't<00:02:00.819> have<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> lock<00:02:01.810> on

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
locks that were didn't have a lock on

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.570 
locks that were didn't have a lock on
the<00:02:02.080> inside<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.619> key<00:02:02.800> lock<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.220> outside

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the inside but a key lock on the outside

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.369 
the inside but a key lock on the outside
and<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.179> last<00:02:04.390> thing<00:02:04.569> is<00:02:04.660> emergency<00:02:05.080> is<00:02:05.259> you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:05.379 
and the last thing is emergency is you

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.770 
and the last thing is emergency is you
want<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.649> go<00:02:05.770> back<00:02:06.009> outside<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.849> room<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.030> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
want to go back outside the room and you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.510 
want to go back outside the room and you
know<00:02:07.899> try<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.349> fiddle<00:02:08.679> with<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.979> lock<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.369> get

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
know try to fiddle with the lock to get

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.339 
know try to fiddle with the lock to get
it<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.759> lock<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.209> now<00:02:10.330> this<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.720> an<00:02:10.869> instant

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
it to lock so now this is an instant

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.229 
it to lock so now this is an instant
solution<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> make<00:02:12.069> sure<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.970> know<00:02:13.090> if

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
solution to make sure that you know if

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.150 
solution to make sure that you know if
there<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.569> problem<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.379> building<00:02:14.770> we

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
there is a problem in the building we

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.670 
there is a problem in the building we

isolate the children we slow down any
problem<00:02:18.190> from<00:02:18.370> getting<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> classrooms

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
problem from getting to the classrooms

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.270 
problem from getting to the classrooms
by<00:02:20.230> several<00:02:20.590> levels<00:02:20.920> of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
by several levels of

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.390 
by several levels of
of<00:02:21.400> security<00:02:21.910> before<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:23.020> had<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.590> we<00:02:24.250> were

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
of security before we had this we were

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
of security before we had this we were
trying<00:02:24.700> much<00:02:25.030> more<00:02:25.270> manual<00:02:25.840> things<00:02:26.110> which

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
trying much more manual things which

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.820 
trying much more manual things which
were<00:02:27.490> helpful<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.570> took<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> lot<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.230> time

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
were helpful but took a lot of time

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
were helpful but took a lot of time
administrative<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.940> people<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.510> are

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
administrative so people that are

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.150 
administrative so people that are
administrative<00:02:32.440> assistants<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:32.980> used<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
administrative assistants that used to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.800 
administrative assistants that used to
be<00:02:33.310> doing<00:02:33.490> other<00:02:33.670> things<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:34.180> at<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.570> front

door checking things out and that's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.130 
door checking things out and that's
really<00:02:36.280> eliminated<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.570> need<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.840> do<00:02:37.990> that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
really eliminated to need to do that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.900 
really eliminated to need to do that
because<00:02:38.350> we<00:02:38.709> once<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.280> become<00:02:39.700> comfortable

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
because we once we become comfortable

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520 
because we once we become comfortable
with<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.330> process<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.780> I've<00:02:41.020> been<00:02:41.140> committed

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
with the process and I've been committed

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.470 
with the process and I've been committed
we<00:02:42.160> don't<00:02:42.340> need<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.550> have<00:02:42.700> those<00:02:42.880> manual

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
we don't need to have those manual

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.570 
we don't need to have those manual
processes<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.020> place<00:02:44.140> anymore<00:02:44.530> that's<00:02:45.370> been<00:02:45.550> a

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
processes in place anymore that's been a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.000 
processes in place anymore that's been a
real<00:02:45.760> benefit<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:47.050> makes<00:02:47.230> us<00:02:47.380> feel<00:02:47.410> much<00:02:47.740> safer

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
real benefit it makes us feel much safer

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.310 
real benefit it makes us feel much safer
and<00:02:48.820> particularly<00:02:49.240> our<00:02:49.480> parents<00:02:49.900> are<00:02:49.990> really

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
and particularly our parents are really

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.660 
and particularly our parents are really

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
appreciative of everything we've put in

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.840 
appreciative of everything we've put in
place<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.810> lot<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.320> parents<00:02:53.730> working<00:02:54.730> to

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
place a lot of the parents working to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.030 
place a lot of the parents working to
head<00:02:54.970> some<00:02:55.120> concerns<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.500> speeds<00:02:56.860> up

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
head some concerns and this speeds up

head some concerns and this speeds up
the<00:02:57.220> whole<00:02:57.340> process<00:02:57.610> even<00:02:58.000> when<00:02:58.209> we<00:02:58.270> were<00:02:58.330> able

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
the whole process even when we were able

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.570 
the whole process even when we were able
to<00:02:58.570> lock<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:58.959> keys<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.440> wasn't<00:02:59.770> really<00:03:00.040> you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
to lock with keys that wasn't really you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.130 
to lock with keys that wasn't really you
didn't<00:03:00.850> feel<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.120> was<00:03:01.180> automatic<00:03:01.780> or<00:03:01.900> fast

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
didn't feel it was automatic or fast

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.360 
didn't feel it was automatic or fast
enough<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.650> has<00:03:02.770> been<00:03:02.890> really<00:03:03.070> really

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
enough and this has been really really

seamless to be able to implement the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.350 
seamless to be able to implement the
