very durable which is great another

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
very durable which is great another
awesome<00:00:32.969> feature<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:34.020> an

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
awesome feature is that it has an

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
awesome feature is that it has an
independent<00:00:34.530> reach<00:00:35.160> adjustment<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:35.880> as

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
independent reach adjustment as well as

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
independent reach adjustment as well as
a<00:00:36.180> bite<00:00:36.420> point<00:00:36.719> adjustment<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.559> going

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a bite point adjustment so that's going

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
a bite point adjustment so that's going
to<00:00:37.770> let<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> dial<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> exact<00:00:39.030> position<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to let you dial in the exact position of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.910 
to let you dial in the exact position of
the<00:00:39.629> lever<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> fit<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.350> hand<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the lever to fit your hand and be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
the lever to fit your hand and be
comfortable<00:00:41.309> while<00:00:41.579> you're<00:00:41.760> riding<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.510> then

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
comfortable while you're riding but then

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.389 
comfortable while you're riding but then
you<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.840> independently<00:00:43.469> set<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> bite<00:00:44.040> point

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you can independently set the bite point

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
you can independently set the bite point
of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> brake<00:00:44.940> meaning<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> point<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.840> which

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of the brake meaning the point at which

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
of the brake meaning the point at which
the<00:00:46.170> pads<00:00:46.379> engage<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> lever<00:00:47.460> stroke<00:00:47.850> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the pads engage in the lever stroke so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
the pads engage in the lever stroke so
you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.510> dial<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> exact<00:00:49.350> braking<00:00:49.800> field

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
you can dial in the exact braking field

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
you can dial in the exact braking field
that<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.090> next<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.420> looking<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that you want so next up looking at the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
that you want so next up looking at the
caliper<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.399> aluminum

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
caliper this is going to be an aluminum

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.220 
caliper this is going to be an aluminum
caliper<00:00:54.300> body<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.110> very

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
caliper body so it's going to be very

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
caliper body so it's going to be very
strong<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.829> also<00:00:55.890> lightweight<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
strong but also lightweight but as you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420 
strong but also lightweight but as you
can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> probably<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
can see from from this and probably the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
can see from from this and probably the
first<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.090> notice<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
first thing that you notice is that this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.990 
first thing that you notice is that this
is<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> four<00:01:01.320> piston<00:01:01.680> caliper<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.910> going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is a four piston caliper so it's going

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 
is a four piston caliper so it's going
to<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.210> two<00:01:03.449> sets<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.840> Pistons<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.860> that's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to have two sets of Pistons so that's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
to have two sets of Pistons so that's
going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> deliver<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.549> ton<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> stopping<00:01:06.450> power

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
going to deliver a ton of stopping power

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.690 
going to deliver a ton of stopping power
but<00:01:06.960> what's<00:01:07.350> less<00:01:07.680> obvious<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.250> pretty<00:01:08.520> cool

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but what's less obvious and pretty cool

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.130 
but what's less obvious and pretty cool
is<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> actually<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> use<00:01:09.869> two

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
is that it actually is going to use two

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
is that it actually is going to use two
independent<00:01:10.710> sets<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> brake<00:01:11.220> pads<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.909> lets

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
independent sets of brake pads that lets

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.670 
independent sets of brake pads that lets
the<00:01:12.360> Pistons<00:01:12.720> move<00:01:12.900> independently<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.590> each

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the Pistons move independently of each

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
the Pistons move independently of each
other<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> deliver<00:01:14.909> really

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
other and that's going to deliver really

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
other and that's going to deliver really
great<00:01:15.630> modulation<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> allow<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> pads<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
great modulation and allow the pads to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
great modulation and allow the pads to
engage<00:01:17.670> independently<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> each<00:01:18.600> other

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
engage independently of each other

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
engage independently of each other
another<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.740> cool<00:01:19.860> thing<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
another really cool thing about the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.800 
another really cool thing about the
brake<00:01:20.549> pads<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> muggers

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
brake pads is the use of muggers

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
brake pads is the use of muggers
magnetic<00:01:22.380> change<00:01:22.650> technology<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:24.270> this

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
magnetic change technology and what this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
magnetic change technology and what this
is<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> pads<00:01:25.439> themselves<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
is is that the pads themselves and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
is is that the pads themselves and
pistons<00:01:26.729> are<00:01:26.880> actually<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
pistons are actually going to be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
pistons are actually going to be
magnetized<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.130> removing

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
magnetized so that as you're removing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
magnetized so that as you're removing
and<00:01:29.790> replacing<00:01:29.850> pads<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.780> servicing<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and replacing pads or servicing the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.929 
and replacing pads or servicing the
brake<00:01:31.560> they'll<00:01:32.220> actually<00:01:32.400> hold<00:01:32.759> themselves

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
brake they'll actually hold themselves

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
brake they'll actually hold themselves
in<00:01:33.299> place<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:34.380> they're<00:01:34.530> magnetized<00:01:34.920> very

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
in place because they're magnetized very

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.030 
in place because they're magnetized very
cool<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:35.939> easy<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> service<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> Magura

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cool very easy to service so the Magura

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.149 
cool very easy to service so the Magura
mt7<00:01:38.880> next<00:01:39.270> disc<00:01:39.509> brake<00:01:39.750> uses<00:01:40.140> Magura<00:01:40.470> ZZ<00:01:40.829> bleed

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
mt7 next disc brake uses Magura ZZ bleed

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
mt7 next disc brake uses Magura ZZ bleed
technology<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.060> servicing<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> bleeding<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
technology so servicing and bleeding the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.319 
technology so servicing and bleeding the
brake<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.740> simple<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.880> also<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
brake is very simple it's also going to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.700 
brake is very simple it's also going to
run<00:01:45.450> mineral<00:01:45.810> oil<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> environmentally

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
run mineral oil so it's environmentally

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.399 
run mineral oil so it's environmentally
friendly<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.549> great<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.750> whole<00:01:48.930> system

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
friendly which is great the whole system

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.399
