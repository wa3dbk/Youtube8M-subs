00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.630 

deflect<00:00:06.590> the<00:00:06.680> space<00:00:06.920> warps<00:00:07.220> as<00:00:07.340> I've<00:00:07.490> said

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
deflect the space warps as I've said

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.790 
deflect the space warps as I've said
previously<00:00:07.820> in<00:00:08.210> this<00:00:08.330> DVD<00:00:08.600> are<00:00:08.900> the<00:00:09.470> second

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
previously in this DVD are the second

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.200 
previously in this DVD are the second
half<00:00:10.040> of<00:00:10.220> the<00:00:10.340> collision<00:00:10.550> system<00:00:10.910> within

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
half of the collision system within

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.840 
half of the collision system within
particle<00:00:11.720> flow<00:00:11.920> the<00:00:12.920> first<00:00:13.160> half<00:00:13.400> was<00:00:13.430> the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
particle flow the first half was the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.369 
particle flow the first half was the
collision<00:00:14.150> test<00:00:14.389> which<00:00:14.809> we<00:00:14.959> covered<00:00:15.110> in<00:00:15.320> the

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
collision test which we covered in the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.010 
collision test which we covered in the
previous<00:00:15.530> chapter<00:00:16.210> so<00:00:17.210> let's<00:00:17.720> have<00:00:17.810> a<00:00:17.870> quick

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
previous chapter so let's have a quick

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.810 
previous chapter so let's have a quick
look<00:00:18.050> at<00:00:18.440> where<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.950> deflector<00:00:19.340> space<00:00:19.550> warps

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
look at where the deflector space warps

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.859 
look at where the deflector space warps
are<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.270> how<00:00:21.140> to<00:00:21.200> link<00:00:21.440> them<00:00:21.560> up<00:00:21.650> without<00:00:21.800> flow

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
are and how to link them up without flow

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.900 
are and how to link them up without flow
okay<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:25.070> can<00:00:25.099> see<00:00:25.279> I've<00:00:25.369> got<00:00:25.400> a<00:00:25.550> basic

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
okay so you can see I've got a basic

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.249 
okay so you can see I've got a basic
seen<00:00:26.119> here<00:00:26.359> in<00:00:26.480> max<00:00:27.140> I'm<00:00:27.470> just<00:00:28.310> going<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.550> go<00:00:28.730> to

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
seen here in max I'm just going to go to

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.800 
seen here in max I'm just going to go to
standard<00:00:30.259> primitives<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:31.390> I'm<00:00:32.390> going<00:00:32.630> to<00:00:32.660> go

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
standard primitives and I'm going to go

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.660 
standard primitives and I'm going to go
down<00:00:32.960> to<00:00:32.990> particle<00:00:33.530> systems<00:00:33.920> particle<00:00:34.550> flow

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
down to particle systems particle flow

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.360 
down to particle systems particle flow
source<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:35.930> need<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.080> source<00:00:36.320> for<00:00:36.470> particles<00:00:37.010> so

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
source we need a source for particles so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.330 
source we need a source for particles so
I'll<00:00:37.430> just<00:00:37.460> draw<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:37.910> there<00:00:39.070> I'll<00:00:40.070> move<00:00:40.250> it

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
I'll just draw that there I'll move it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.880 
I'll just draw that there I'll move it
up<00:00:40.899> so<00:00:41.899> it's<00:00:42.050> actually<00:00:42.140> above<00:00:42.440> our<00:00:42.590> playing

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
up so it's actually above our playing

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.819 
up so it's actually above our playing
and<00:00:43.960> then<00:00:44.960> I'm<00:00:45.170> going<00:00:45.289> to<00:00:45.320> actually<00:00:45.469> create

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
and then I'm going to actually create

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.160 
and then I'm going to actually create
the<00:00:46.180> space<00:00:47.180> warps<00:00:47.449> straight<00:00:47.660> away<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:47.930> I'm

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
the space warps straight away so I'm

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.500 
the space warps straight away so I'm
going<00:00:48.289> to<00:00:48.320> go<00:00:48.440> down<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.770> space<00:00:49.430> warps<00:00:49.760> this<00:00:50.359> is

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
going to go down to space warps this is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.599 
going to go down to space warps this is
in<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.690> creation<00:00:50.930> panel<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.340> can<00:00:52.460> see

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
in the creation panel and you can see

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.430 
in the creation panel and you can see
it's<00:00:52.730> on<00:00:52.850> deflectors<00:00:53.300> already<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.960> first<00:00:54.170> set

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
it's on deflectors already the first set

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.279 
it's on deflectors already the first set
is<00:00:54.590> actually<00:00:54.859> forces<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:56.510> second<00:00:56.899> set<00:00:57.079> is

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
is actually forces the second set is

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.750 
is actually forces the second set is
deflectors<00:00:57.949> which<00:00:58.309> are<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.489> ones<00:00:58.609> we're

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
deflectors which are the ones we're

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.180 
deflectors which are the ones we're
interested<00:00:59.000> in<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.620> I'm<00:01:00.620> actually<00:01:00.859> going<00:01:01.100> to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
interested in and I'm actually going to

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.080 
interested in and I'm actually going to
just<00:01:01.370> pick<00:01:01.609> a<00:01:01.940> selection<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:03.170> different

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.090 
just pick a selection of different

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.010 
just pick a selection of different
deflectors<00:01:05.090> we<00:01:05.239> get<00:01:05.390> an<00:01:05.480> idea<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:05.750> how<00:01:05.870> they

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
deflectors we get an idea of how they

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.550 
deflectors we get an idea of how they
work<00:01:06.200> I'll<00:01:07.160> have<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:08.110> plane<00:01:09.110> which<00:01:09.380> actually

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
work I'll have a plane which actually

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.230 
work I'll have a plane which actually
goes<00:01:09.830> right<00:01:10.009> up<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.159> this<00:01:10.280> line<00:01:10.520> here<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.060> i'll

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
goes right up to this line here and i'll

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.450 
goes right up to this line here and i'll
have<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.509> stop<00:01:11.750> there<00:01:11.990> i'll<00:01:12.950> use<00:01:13.189> an<00:01:13.340> s

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
have it stop there i'll use an s

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.160 
have it stop there i'll use an s
deflector<00:01:14.030> which<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.479> short<00:01:14.720> for<00:01:14.780> spherical

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
deflector which is short for spherical

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.499 
deflector which is short for spherical
deflector<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.070> that's<00:01:16.280> just<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.640> parametric

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
deflector and that's just a parametric

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.840 
deflector and that's just a parametric
object<00:01:17.869> which<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.140> sphere<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.680> i'll<00:01:19.640> create

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
object which is a sphere and i'll create

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.810 
object which is a sphere and i'll create
that<00:01:20.060> here<00:01:20.890> let's<00:01:21.890> just<00:01:22.159> move<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.340> may<00:01:22.640> be<00:01:22.700> a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
that here let's just move that may be a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.060 
that here let's just move that may be a
little<00:01:23.060> bit<00:01:23.270> over<00:01:23.689> here<00:01:25.030> there<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.119> go<00:01:27.070> she'll

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
little bit over here there we go she'll

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.319 
little bit over here there we go she'll
just<00:01:28.250> look<00:01:28.369> from<00:01:28.549> above<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:28.939> we<00:01:29.030> get<00:01:29.210> the

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
just look from above so we get the

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.770 
just look from above so we get the
placement<00:01:29.750> bang<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:30.640> let's<00:01:31.640> move<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:32.659> over

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
placement bang on let's move this over

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.450 
placement bang on let's move this over
here<00:01:34.899> go<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.110> plains<00:01:36.350> actually<00:01:37.100> fine<00:01:39.460> okay

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
here go on the plains actually fine okay

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.760 
here go on the plains actually fine okay
so<00:01:40.880> there<00:01:41.060> are<00:01:41.149> objects<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.409> last<00:01:42.590> thing

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
so there are objects and the last thing

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.850 
so there are objects and the last thing
I'll<00:01:42.920> actually<00:01:43.070> create<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:44.030> teapot<00:01:44.799> so<00:01:45.799> I'll

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
I'll actually create is a teapot so I'll

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.060 
I'll actually create is a teapot so I'll
just<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:46.220> standard<00:01:46.610> primitives<00:01:46.899> teapot

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
just go up to standard primitives teapot

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.020 
just go up to standard primitives teapot
and<00:01:49.070> I'll<00:01:49.219> put<00:01:49.399> that<00:01:49.430> here<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:51.710> go<00:01:51.890> back<00:01:52.820> down

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and I'll put that here we go back down

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.999 
and I'll put that here we go back down
to<00:01:53.060> space<00:01:53.360> warps<00:01:53.719> i'm<00:01:54.200> going<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.590> pick<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.740> you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
to space warps i'm going to pick a you

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.380 
to space warps i'm going to pick a you
deflector<00:01:55.840> place<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.020> here<00:01:57.939> there<00:01:58.939> we<00:01:59.030> go<00:01:59.210> and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
deflector place it here there we go and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.179 
deflector place it here there we go and
the<00:01:59.899> you<00:01:59.990> deflector<00:02:00.439> actually<00:02:00.710> allows<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.040> to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
the you deflector actually allows you to

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.160 
the you deflector actually allows you to
use<00:02:01.369> any<00:02:01.670> piece<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.090> geometry<00:02:02.299> as<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.689> deflector

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
use any piece of geometry as a deflector

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.020 
use any piece of geometry as a deflector
but<00:02:03.799> obviously<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.369> more<00:02:04.520> complex<00:02:04.909> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
but obviously the more complex the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.149 
but obviously the more complex the
geometry<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.570> slower<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.350> we'll<00:02:06.979> keep

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
geometry the slower it is so we'll keep

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.210 
geometry the slower it is so we'll keep
this<00:02:07.310> teapot<00:02:07.670> quite<00:02:07.939> simple<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:09.009> i'll<00:02:10.009> pick

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
this teapot quite simple and i'll pick

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.570 
this teapot quite simple and i'll pick
that<00:02:10.460> teapot<00:02:11.210> there<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.200> go<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:13.070> now<00:02:13.190> we<00:02:13.250> have

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
that teapot there we go so now we have

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.240 
that teapot there we go so now we have
the<00:02:14.000> three<00:02:14.210> basic<00:02:14.800> deflectors<00:02:15.800> are<00:02:15.920> nursing

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
the three basic deflectors are nursing

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.680 
the three basic deflectors are nursing
we<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> s<00:02:17.390> deflector<00:02:18.140> here

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
we have a s deflector here

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.740 
we have a s deflector here
a<00:02:19.220> deflector<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:21.660> new<00:02:22.200> deflector<00:02:22.880> now<00:02:23.880> at

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
a deflector and a new deflector now at

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.690 
a deflector and a new deflector now at
the<00:02:24.900> other<00:02:25.020> eras<00:02:25.260> another<00:02:25.530> set<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.890> space

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
the other eras another set of space

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.160 
the other eras another set of space
whoops<00:02:26.940> called<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> Omni<00:02:27.540> deflectors<00:02:28.020> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
whoops called the Omni deflectors and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.630 
whoops called the Omni deflectors and
they<00:02:28.230> actually<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.710> some<00:02:28.950> more<00:02:29.070> options<00:02:29.460> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
they actually have some more options and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.290 
they actually have some more options and
it<00:02:30.270> knows<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.640> equivalent<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.730> called<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.030> pee

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
it knows the equivalent is called a pee

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.390 
it knows the equivalent is called a pee
on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.990> deflector<00:02:34.770> for<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.220> which

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
on the deflector for this one which

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520 
on the deflector for this one which
stands<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:35.760> planar<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.500> should

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
stands for planar so really they should

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.560 
stands for planar so really they should
have<00:02:37.740> actually<00:02:37.830> call<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.820> pee

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
have actually call this one a pee

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.790 
have actually call this one a pee
deflector<00:02:40.020> rather<00:02:40.200> than<00:02:40.290> actually<00:02:40.590> just

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
deflector rather than actually just

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.170 
deflector rather than actually just
deflect<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.610> keep<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.880> naming

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
deflect it just to keep the naming

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.810 
deflect it just to keep the naming
system<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> same<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.310> actually<00:02:44.490> have<00:02:44.640> an

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
system the same but you actually have an

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.570 
system the same but you actually have an
S<00:02:44.940> Omni<00:02:45.240> Omni<00:02:45.750> deflector<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.550> a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
S Omni Omni deflector as you have a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.550 
S Omni Omni deflector as you have a
spherical<00:02:48.060> deflector<00:02:48.450> here<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:49.410> saw

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
spherical deflector here and you all saw

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.950 
spherical deflector here and you all saw
this<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.310> called<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.000> deflector<00:02:51.750> and

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
this is called a you deflector and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.560 
this is called a you deflector and
that's<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.440> U<00:02:52.530> stands<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.010> universal<00:02:53.570> you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
that's the U stands for universal you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.800 
that's the U stands for universal you
also<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.200> omni<00:02:55.800> deflector<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.310> well

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
also have a you omni deflector as well

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.180 
also have a you omni deflector as well
so<00:02:57.810> let's<00:02:58.440> have<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> look<00:02:58.620> at<00:02:58.800> actually<00:02:59.130> how

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
so let's have a look at actually how

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
so let's have a look at actually how
they<00:02:59.670> all<00:02:59.790> work<00:02:59.840> I'll<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:01.020> move<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.320> over

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
they all work I'll just move it over

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.560 
they all work I'll just move it over
here<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.640> particle<00:03:03.300> view<00:03:03.420> when

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
here so we can see a particle view when

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.190 
here so we can see a particle view when
i<00:03:03.600> open<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:04.580> there<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.820> we've<00:03:06.690> got<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> basic

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
i open up there it is we've got a basic

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.570 
i open up there it is we've got a basic
flow<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.940> i<00:03:09.150> actually<00:03:09.300> let<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> flow<00:03:09.900> go<00:03:10.580> let's

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
flow if i actually let the flow go let's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.770 
flow if i actually let the flow go let's
just<00:03:11.760> move<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.330> bit<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.600> i<00:03:12.630> can

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
just move this up here bit so i can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.870 
just move this up here bit so i can
scrub<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.070> see<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.250> particles<00:03:14.640> come

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
scrub you can see the particles come

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.670 
scrub you can see the particles come
down<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.840> they<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.350> keep<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.620> going

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
down and they they just keep on going

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.830 
down and they they just keep on going
forever<00:03:18.440> just<00:03:19.440> change<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.890> speed<00:03:20.130> slightly

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
forever just change the speed slightly

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.560 
forever just change the speed slightly
it's<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> little<00:03:22.080> bit<00:03:22.170> slower<00:03:23.330> there<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.420> go

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
it's a little bit slower there we go

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.170 
it's a little bit slower there we go
it's<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.380> more<00:03:25.500> sedate<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.150> what<00:03:27.150> i

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
it's a little bit more sedate and what i

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.580 
it's a little bit more sedate and what i
want<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.480> do<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.720> actually<00:03:27.959> want<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> create

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
want to do is I actually want to create

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.900 
want to do is I actually want to create
some<00:03:29.580> tech<00:03:29.790> collisions<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:31.580> it's<00:03:32.580> actually

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
some tech collisions so it's actually

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.000 
some tech collisions so it's actually
quite<00:03:33.000> possible<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.350> collisions<00:03:34.739> in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
quite possible to have the collisions in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.090 
quite possible to have the collisions in
more<00:03:35.430> than<00:03:35.550> one<00:03:35.700> test<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.530> seen<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:37.920> let's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
more than one test in you seen so let's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.260 
more than one test in you seen so let's
actually<00:03:38.160> do<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.550> first<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.060> show<00:03:39.239> that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
actually do that first just to show that

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.260 
actually do that first just to show that
you<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:40.320> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.650> flexibility<00:03:41.270> will

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
you have that kind of flexibility will

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.990 
you have that kind of flexibility will
actually<00:03:42.540> create<00:03:43.640> three<00:03:44.640> separate

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
actually create three separate

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.810 
actually create three separate
collisions<00:03:45.570> here<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.580> what<00:03:47.580> I'm<00:03:47.610> actually

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
collisions here and what I'm actually

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.900 
collisions here and what I'm actually
going<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.420> if<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.459> create<00:03:50.459> three<00:03:50.760> more

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
going to do is if I create three more

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.270 
going to do is if I create three more
events<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.510> we'll<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.750> use<00:03:51.959> display<00:03:52.410> events

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
events and we'll just use display events

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.690 
events and we'll just use display events
for<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.690> there's<00:03:54.690> one<00:03:54.930> two<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:57.420> three<00:03:58.700> it's

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
for that there's one two and three it's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.220 
for that there's one two and three it's
going<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.030> zoom<00:04:00.269> mode<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.750> zoom<00:04:00.959> out<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.140> little

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
going to zoom mode and zoom out a little

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
going to zoom mode and zoom out a little
bit

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.300 

okay<00:04:05.940> there<00:04:06.120> we<00:04:06.180> go<00:04:06.210> so<00:04:06.950> what<00:04:07.950> I'm<00:04:08.040> going<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> do

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
okay there we go so what I'm going to do

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.500 
okay there we go so what I'm going to do
now<00:04:08.490> is<00:04:08.520> I'm<00:04:08.700> going<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.880> wire<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.030> each<00:04:09.330> one<00:04:09.480> of

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
now is I'm going to wire up each one of

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.009 
now is I'm going to wire up each one of
these<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.960> a<00:04:09.990> different<00:04:10.460> display<00:04:11.460> event<00:04:15.019> now

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
these to a different display event now

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.449 
these to a different display event now
we<00:04:16.079> are<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:16.920> see<00:04:17.010> they've<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:17.280> got

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
we are and you can see they've all got

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.920 
we are and you can see they've all got
different<00:04:17.549> colors<00:04:17.970> this<00:04:18.090> one's<00:04:18.269> yellow<00:04:18.600> this

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
different colors this one's yellow this

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.060 
different colors this one's yellow this
one's<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.170> kind<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.410> maroon<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.829> this<00:04:19.920> is<00:04:20.040> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
one's a kind of maroon and this is a

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.970 
one's a kind of maroon and this is a
kind<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.340> mustardy<00:04:20.880> color<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.680> first

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
kind of mustardy color and the first

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.030 
kind of mustardy color and the first
collision<00:04:23.340> I'm<00:04:23.670> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.270> add<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.650> spherical

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
collision I'm going to add the spherical

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.430 
collision I'm going to add the spherical
deflector<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:27.450> actually<00:04:27.960> what<00:04:28.080> I'll<00:04:28.200> do<00:04:28.320> is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
deflector and actually what I'll do is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.050 
deflector and actually what I'll do is
just<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.680> make<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:28.950> bit<00:04:29.070> clearer<00:04:29.400> don't<00:04:30.000> know

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
just to make it a bit clearer don't know

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.100 
just to make it a bit clearer don't know
if<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.210> actually<00:04:30.390> do<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.840> get<00:04:33.990> rid

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
if I can actually do it it's it get rid

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.650 
if I can actually do it it's it get rid
of<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.350> zoom<00:04:34.910> let<00:04:35.910> me<00:04:36.000> just<00:04:36.180> move<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.330> way

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
of the zoom let me just move this way

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.480 
of the zoom let me just move this way
over<00:04:37.020> here<00:04:37.260> it's<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.890> bit<00:04:38.010> of<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.100> clear<00:04:38.340> up

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
over here it's a bit of a clear up

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.210 
over here it's a bit of a clear up
what's<00:04:38.700> going<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.800> i'll<00:04:40.800> actually<00:04:40.950> move

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
what's going on and i'll actually move

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.580 
what's going on and i'll actually move
this<00:04:41.340> over<00:04:41.490> here<00:04:41.790> as<00:04:42.720> well<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:45.380> move<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.530> up

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
this over here as well and move this up

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.140 
this over here as well and move this up
here<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.370> we<00:04:47.490> can<00:04:47.580> actually<00:04:47.669> get<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.000> better

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
here so we can actually get a better

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.090 
here so we can actually get a better
idea<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:49.370> what's<00:04:50.370> going<00:04:50.460> where<00:04:50.790> ok<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:51.600> our

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
idea of what's going where ok so our

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.830 
idea of what's going where ok so our
fellow<00:04:53.100> first<00:04:53.580> collision<00:04:54.150> test<00:04:54.450> is<00:04:54.600> going<00:04:54.720> to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
fellow first collision test is going to

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.930 
fellow first collision test is going to
the<00:04:54.930> s<00:04:55.020> deflector<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.740> that's<00:04:56.520> been<00:04:56.700> sent

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
the s deflector and that's been sent

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.010 
the s deflector and that's been sent
over<00:04:57.030> here<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.510> yellow<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:58.500> second<00:04:58.890> one
