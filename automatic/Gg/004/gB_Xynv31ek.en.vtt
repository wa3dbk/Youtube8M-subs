so he drops his barbarian King right in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.609 
so he drops his barbarian King right in
the<00:01:13.770> middle<00:01:13.979> which<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.479> terrible<00:01:16.049> idea<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.490 
bitch all right so he's starting out by
taking<00:03:05.120> out<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.389> hero<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:05.989> he's<00:03:06.139> drawing<00:03:06.380> them

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
taking out the hero so he's drawing them

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.420 
taking out the hero so he's drawing them
over<00:03:06.799> in<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:06.980> corner<00:03:07.250> because<00:03:09.100> that's<00:03:10.100> just

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
over in the corner because that's just

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.309 
over in the corner because that's just
where<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.790> take<00:03:11.030> out<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.480> hero<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
where you take out the hero in the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.920 
where you take out the hero in the
corner<00:03:12.769> so<00:03:13.519> he<00:03:13.549> thinks<00:03:14.060> he<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.329> take<00:03:14.750> out

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
corner so he thinks he can just take out

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.229 
corner so he thinks he can just take out
the<00:03:14.959> heroes<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:15.859> this<00:03:16.069> his<00:03:16.700> clan<00:03:17.000> castle

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
the heroes with this his clan castle

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.900 
the heroes with this his clan castle
troops<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:18.139> their<00:03:18.290> max<00:03:18.650> those<00:03:19.549> heroes<00:03:19.850> are

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
troops but their max those heroes are

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.750 
troops but their max those heroes are
going<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.120> take<00:03:20.209> out<00:03:20.329> all<00:03:20.510> 240<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.650> his<00:03:22.250> wimpy

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.229 
troops so it looks like the heroes are
getting<00:03:25.730> damaged<00:03:27.040> okay<00:03:28.040> maybe<00:03:28.250> he<00:03:28.400> will<00:03:28.819> and

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
