one<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.070> starting<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.610> kind<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.120> have

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
one that's starting to kind of have

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.150 
one that's starting to kind of have
hairs<00:02:43.600> work<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.140> but<00:02:44.470> they're<00:02:44.620> not<00:02:44.740> falling

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
out and it doesn't really affect the the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.130 
out and it doesn't really affect the the
you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.240> way<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> brush<00:02:49.780> works<00:02:49.990> or

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
you know the way that the brush works or

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.620 
you know the way that the brush works or

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
whatever reason even though I use this

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.880

somewhat similar to this one from Sonia
Kashuk<00:03:01.239> which<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.930> also<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.950> contour

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400

blush<00:03:03.580> brush<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.209> these<00:03:04.360> are<00:03:04.630> two<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.840> my

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
blush brush and these are two of my

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.780 
blush brush and these are two of my
favorite<00:03:05.410> blush<00:03:05.590> brushes<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.250> own<00:03:06.459> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
favorite blush brushes that I own the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.270 
favorite blush brushes that I own the
only<00:03:07.209> downside<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.320> these<00:03:08.470> brushes<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:09.040> that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
only downside of these brushes is that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.410 
only downside of these brushes is that
because<00:03:09.760> they're<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.650> dense<00:03:11.650> um<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:13.180> take

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
because they're so dense um they take

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.900 
because they're so dense um they take
forever<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.930> dry<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:14.800> for<00:03:15.130> me<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> find<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.850> I

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
forever to dry so for me I find that I

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.400 
forever to dry so for me I find that I
usually<00:03:16.120> need<00:03:16.450> like<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.690> day<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.080> half<00:03:17.110> two

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
usually need like a day and a half two

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.840 
usually need like a day and a half two
days<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:17.709> these<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.980> be<00:03:18.010> completely<00:03:18.489> dry

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
days for these to be completely dry

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.540 
days for these to be completely dry
again<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.690> that's<00:03:20.200> sort<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.860> bummer<00:03:21.040> but
