00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
regular edition so the selimut is pretty

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
regular edition so the selimut is pretty
cool<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
cool as you can see here this is the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.360 
cool as you can see here this is the
master<00:00:31.289> chief<00:00:31.800> helmet<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.750> I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.860> bit

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
master chief helmet and I was a bit

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.990 
master chief helmet and I was a bit
disappointed<00:00:35.570> when<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.620> pop<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.890> open

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.190 

because<00:00:43.789> there's<00:00:44.789> no<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.020> put

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
because there's no way that you can put

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.420 
because there's no way that you can put
your<00:00:46.289> head<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.739> helmet<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:48.469> think<00:00:49.469> maybe

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
your head in this helmet I think maybe

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
your head in this helmet I think maybe
you<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:52.039> modified<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> even

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you could if you modified it but even

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
you could if you modified it but even
then<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.520> pretty

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
then you would have to have a pretty

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.110 
then you would have to have a pretty
small<00:00:57.180> head<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
small head and I don't think that this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
small head and I don't think that this
visor<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:01.190> like<00:01:02.190> see-through<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.940> probably

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
visor is like see-through it's probably

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.170 
visor is like see-through it's probably
just<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:04.309> shiny<00:01:05.309> cover<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.490> does<00:01:08.760> serve<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
just a shiny cover but it does serve a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.800 
just a shiny cover but it does serve a
useful<00:01:09.360> purpose<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.420> some<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
useful purpose here you can put some of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
looking at the game itself this is a

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
game for the 360 when you think of the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
soldier who has a you know that suit

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.219 
soldier who has a you know that suit
with<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.850> helmet<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.390> showed<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.720> and

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
with the helmet that I showed you and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.730 
with the helmet that I showed you and
you're<00:02:10.009> battling<00:02:10.340> these<00:02:10.640> aliens<00:02:11.740> the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
you're battling these aliens the

you're battling these aliens the
original<00:02:13.520> halo<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:14.420> very<00:02:14.870> cool<00:02:15.230> probably<00:02:15.920> one

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
original halo was very cool probably one

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.580 
original halo was very cool probably one
of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.760> best<00:02:16.970> games<00:02:18.130> made<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.470> think<00:02:21.470> with

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
of the best games made but I think with

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.690 
of the best games made but I think with
Halo<00:02:21.800> 2<00:02:22.130> they<00:02:22.490> started<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:24.430> screw<00:02:25.430> up<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
Halo 2 they started to screw up the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.790 
Halo 2 they started to screw up the
story<00:02:26.000> line<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.270> bit<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.600> even<00:02:27.590> though<00:02:27.680> the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
story line a bit and even though the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.990 
story line a bit and even though the
gameplay<00:02:28.220> was<00:02:28.250> good<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:31.040> storyline<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.730> just

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
gameplay was good the storyline is just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.840 
gameplay was good the storyline is just
it's<00:02:32.870> not<00:02:33.050> satisfying<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:35.380> halo<00:02:36.380> 3<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:37.040> feel

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
it's not satisfying and halo 3 I feel

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.300 
it's not satisfying and halo 3 I feel
like<00:02:37.970> they<00:02:38.180> sort<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.690> vote<00:02:39.500> themselves<00:02:39.770> into<00:02:40.280> a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
like they sort of vote themselves into a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.930 
like they sort of vote themselves into a
dead<00:02:40.580> end<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.550> not<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.760> very

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
dead end so it's not it's not a very

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.270 
dead end so it's not it's not a very
good<00:02:44.030> story<00:02:44.360> line<00:02:44.450> here<00:02:44.810> either<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:46.040> gameplay

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
good story line here either the gameplay

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.509 
good story line here either the gameplay
is<00:02:46.520> good<00:02:46.790> there's<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:48.350> familiar<00:02:48.830> weapons<00:02:49.250> and

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
is good there's the familiar weapons and

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.110 
is good there's the familiar weapons and
vehicles<00:02:49.550> from<00:02:50.060> before<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:52.340> add<00:02:52.850> some

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
vehicles from before and they add some

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170 
vehicles from before and they add some
new<00:02:53.269> vehicles<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:55.160> was<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.880> little<00:02:56.060> bit

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180

disappointed that the new vehicles are

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.150 
disappointed that the new vehicles are
or<00:02:59.120> not<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.200> great

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.400 

the<00:03:03.790> level<00:03:04.180> design<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.870> levels<00:03:05.200> are<00:03:05.380> pretty

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the level design the levels are pretty

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.399 
the level design the levels are pretty
big

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.410 

and<00:03:09.409> there's<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.310> lot<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.700> good<00:03:10.879> action<00:03:11.239> and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and there's a lot of good action and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.860 
and there's a lot of good action and
stuff<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:13.069> show<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.090> some<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.450> gameplay

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
stuff so show you some of the gameplay

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.640

here

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.949 

this<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.610> single<00:03:18.939> player<00:03:19.060> mode<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.689> I

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
this is the single player mode and I

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.140 
this is the single player mode and I
think<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.860> would<00:03:20.980> be<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.159> lot<00:03:21.370> more<00:03:21.400> fun<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.970> play
