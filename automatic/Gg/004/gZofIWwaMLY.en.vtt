00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
think at the time they didn't have those

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
think at the time they didn't have those
on<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.740> site<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> i'm<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.340> sure<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.670> they

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
on the site and i'm not sure what they

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.450 
on the site and i'm not sure what they
have<00:00:30.029> them<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.920> went<00:00:32.099> ahead<00:00:32.189> and

to<00:01:21.720> review<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> box<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.490> came

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to review this is the box that it came

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.990 
to review this is the box that it came
in<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> wrong<00:01:26.640> box

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
in and I think this is the wrong box

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
in and I think this is the wrong box
because<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.689> says<00:01:27.869> air<00:01:28.500> jordan<00:01:28.979> 3<00:01:29.009> rich<00:01:29.430> room

because<00:02:54.370> ng<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.239> Silas<00:02:56.170> we<00:02:56.320> don't<00:02:56.500> really<00:02:56.650> get

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
because ng is Silas we don't really get

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.510 
because ng is Silas we don't really get
the<00:02:57.190> carbon<00:02:57.880> fiber<00:02:58.060> anyway<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.340> we<00:03:00.340> don't

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
the carbon fiber anyway so we don't

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.740 
the carbon fiber anyway so we don't
really<00:03:00.670> have<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:00.910> problem<00:03:01.270> when<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.600> come

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
down to the carbon fiber like some of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.550 
down to the carbon fiber like some of
the<00:03:03.400> means<00:03:03.580> do<00:03:03.850> them<00:03:03.989> I'll<00:03:04.989> show<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.200> guys<00:03:05.380> the

the means do them I'll show you guys the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.600 
the means do them I'll show you guys the
