00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.250
 now answering the obvious question 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.200
 answering is the first place I do not 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.139
 I do not think about getting rich with this. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.870
 much less being a politician is actually the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.549
 I want to make it clear here, I always 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.680
 I liked football 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.289
 So how have I always liked football? 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.939
 being a gay man believes that others 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 gays also like 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.260
 so it was with this idea that I had to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.830
 to really ride a gull was that I 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.990
 said 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.410
 Not to mention football, you like football. 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.550
 likes to be the biggest manifestation 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.739
 homosexual for me that exists is a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 football stadium as I said before 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.570
 60 thousand men watching 22 million 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.149
 behind a ball and when the ball 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.680
 team makes goal he embraced this kiss and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.110
 thatch all their fans another and he 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 Turn that thing from the state then to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.420
 me the biggest gay manifestation there is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.100
 and attempted to find the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.480
 man goes where the minimum has to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 stadium people go anywhere else 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.070
 neighborhood where she goes, what she does not 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 asked to take in all r there soybeans are 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 Obviously we do not reach the guy there 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.250
 that we are playing we have 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.110
 that getting in there I can take it seriously 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.189
 This is obviously not a thing. 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.890
 boring is this is a fight that the fans in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.350
 faithful seagulls will have the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 first place do not do not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.850
 promote or not promote not cause 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.180
 no kind of war incitement 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.520
 We do not want people to be 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 these atrocities that take place within 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.250
 from the stadium 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 our proposal is extremely 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.220
 different like I said biro biro comes here 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.100
 love me 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.030
 was there that began in April was the man 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.030
 what else next? 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:02:10.290
 the daughter had some is what this is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:11.220
 ai ai ai arroyo hombre and so on 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.940
 my God 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.320
 wood b was the man who most 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.540
 I already know 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.670
 democracy has the football stadiums 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 but one attempt in 1988 was the biological lp 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.860
 25 88 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.780
 I think today he promoted that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.240
 the issue of bringing democracy to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.700
 Stadia was a super cool job 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.990
 then nothing is fairer than hell 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.990
 wanting to be my
