 balls 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.390
 only growth 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.390
 and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.310
 and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.380
 Hello, we recommend guitar fight 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.069
 such an attack first do two 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.569
 movements 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.209
 top down like this first 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.890
 motion sound protracted and the second 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.180
 make the movement stronger 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.550
 but after hitting it is slightly weakened at 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.060
 squeezing chords with your left hand followed by 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.330
 go four movements equal to the segment 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.530
 time first from bottom to top then to top 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:46.230
 down again from the bottom up and again from the top 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.230
 down it turns out all together 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.159
 continue to move again from top to bottom 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.950
 similar to the second movement that is 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:03.000
 strong and after it weaken when 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:10.549
 compressing the chord here so repeat all 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.530
 Together and in the conclusion of the battle do two 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.010
 fast motion advantage on lower 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.549
 stringed 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.160
 top down and bottom up after which the battle 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.410
 repeats the very beginning now 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.410
 repeat the fight slowly, completely 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.470
 so this fight is played by 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.900
 once on each chord you can 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.580
 play the whole song with this fight 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.880
 but how can I mean first verses and 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.400
 in the refrain to play a little different fight 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.290
 This fight looks like this first 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.790
 downward motion strongly sound 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.890
 long farther upwards 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.770
 quick movement after which we do 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:06.569
 muffling happens all together 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.340
 further after jamming immediately do 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.610
 bottom-up movement is fast and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.889
 Then we go from top to bottom. 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.310
 bottom up 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.550
 the sound is a little long here and there 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.629
 the same upward movement is obtained 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.629
 all together so 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.370
 and at the conclusion of the battle do five quick 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:39.320
 movements first movement upwards 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.750
 then we turn off and then we move 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.889
 bottom up top down and bottom up 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.510
 after which the fight is repeated from the very beginning 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.510
 now repeat it slowly entirely 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.860
 here and he also play one by one 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.700
 Once on every chord also there is 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.390
 slight change in guitar fights on 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.440
 last verse 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.540
 where the words are sung you are my sunset you are my 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.230
 dawn can play there 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:28.380
 so first do the first three 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:33.630
 combat movements with jamming i.e. top 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:36.330
 down and bottom up and silenced and doing 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.169
 pause then do four quick 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.030
 motions a bottom up 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:45.510
 top down bottom up 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.010
 and again from top to bottom and then doing 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.500
 second jamming 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.350
 next is a pause and go to 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:56.160
 the next chord on which we repeat 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:18.210
 everything is the same it turns out so everything 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:20.690
 together and so on well there for example 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.360
 naturally move on to more 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:29.000
 dynamic battle that's well, that's all 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.000
 I hope to see you soon help
