00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.220
 siebe writers two in profit at home 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.510
 regions blow what did you think of the 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.770
 contest 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.809
 throw think we start it very well 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.309
 first balloon ride over the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.809
 by the goal 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.420
 nature point think knew way back 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.099
 dropped and with consequences counter goal 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.259
 but think the second half has it 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.609
 have taken it into their own hands again and yes 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.199
 i think a very nice football one 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.929
 What is our goal in the victory 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.929
 gives you starting again in the basics 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.110
 but it was harder 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.760
 yes right it was still here effe one on 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.760
 training I feel a lot with this week 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.500
 image as like lately and you do that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
 was rewarded with a tubular day 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.970
 luckily I don't have circumstances 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.560
 were not easy and the soaked field 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
 soaked 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.280
 many led parties and so on yes 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.320
 That 's right that was also evident from it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.700
 football hen debal the much faster as 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.750
 normal and two sentences wines 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.310
 everybody 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.540
 anyway the three points are at home 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.460
 remained and they all have very 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.530
 satisfied with it 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.360
 again the new peter maes what for the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.680
 match said we want that rising 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.840
 sit further 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.650
 that's luck I think yes especially it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.140
 result 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.549
 this competition actually had to be won 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.539
 thus are difficult in football 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.630
 because we want to join the top 5 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.610
 and we did that today 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.619
 and not easy and we know that too 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.149
 there are still a lot of work points and that 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.759
 was very clear today where we are not 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.350
 played our best game but most of all 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.689
 somewhat important within the three points 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.950
 For peace of mind further 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.570
 program 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.850
 the circumstances were not too bad either 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.409
 easy and with the yet professional field 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.610
 and so on 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.990
 yes, but we don't want us there anyway 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.880
 hide behind 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.179
 I am the first to bake it 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.970
 and we still had a chance to play 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.189
 the second to walk loud especially a start 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.349
 could I get a head start that is 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.000
 they happen and with a lot you know that 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:54.250
 that always remains difficult and it is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.020
 turned out with a glossy role 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.970
 I thought this was for yoni buyens 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.950
 match i found the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.619
 few guys good i found irma thomas 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 buffalo also very busy 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.119
 the interest on the left flank for the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.799
 maybe just have it there 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.049
 well done and of course yoni buyens 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.239
 was omnipresent today 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.709
 I have the impression that sort of everything is gradually becoming 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.720
 starts to fall into place with no 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.299
 I think that's also logical 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.769
 some work with a new trainer 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.760
 new players 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.859
 he wants some other things to wear out in 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.219
 so i think that process is what not 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.709
 at 123 you can happen and give it to him 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.200
 we always have players after our 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.870
 way of working at the start slowly 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.730
 bear fruit and be happy in one 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.040
 German victories are not allowed at home 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.769
 too much to explain that none of the good 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.359
 feeling towards the houses martje 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.760
 yes i think we have a better one every week 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.530
 bitter player with that thanks 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.090
 also to the coach 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.260
 Every workout becomes a good go 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.849
 but then becomes the things that have to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.549
 improve and then we'll see on it 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.680
 You were a square and not a good one 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.150
 dress rehearsal for the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.389
 on pesticides next Friday 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.400
 of course yes that is especially for the 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.310
 supporters the match of the year 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.780
 banana and and always have past 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.889
 achieved good results 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.069
 and I have to say it will be a tough one 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:17.379
 Bob I have his current we see very 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.730
 much faster in the team 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.400
 and they are already on a good one there 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 position in the rankings so it becomes 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.599
 the harder than ever before 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.730
 your tube with an assist and one 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.319
 goal you are very much a match 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.530
 been decisive tonight 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.229
 yeah that's always nice you like that too 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.370
 I think I can be more 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.590
 the most important thing is having that today 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.689
 three points stop 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.669
 and especially beautiful football with flags 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.319
 I think you've brought your first half 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.790
 hour from the first everything was decent 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.409
 the first half hour of the second half 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.030
 wash was good 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.340
 just then it leaves the classes fifteen minutes 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.949
 from both 1st and 2nd half a bit too 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.889
 I just wanted to go back 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:58.959
 you see that there are the province see every 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.790
 week in the matches and that is yes that 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.159
 is for me right now 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.259
 super important despite very difficult 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.909
 circumstances their soaked field a lot 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.319
 slide and so on 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.449
 yes those due to circumstances were not 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.699
 ideal but I prefer it that way than 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.500
 30 degrees and the field is very dry 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:17.139
 so you can hear me there again now 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.940
 complaining day is really it gets already 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.500
 but better take the mayonnaise 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900
 yes but thing that also makes sense I think 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 you see a new one with a new trainer 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.310
 idea of playing football and that has to be 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.690
 need time in I say it is possible 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.710
 they are not like that from the first moment 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.380
 draws glitters on it 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.150
 the lease rate I think nowhere 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 happened they see things to try 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.930
 we continue to work in every each 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.280
 to improve that point 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.140
 and there were some points out 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.370
 they don't get well and they have to 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.170
 we try the Friday 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.850
 Sint-Truiden then improve again and 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.970
 well what was good to keep 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.650
 you already get it on Friday stvv that 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.960
 lives here in limburg and you feel the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.880
 arms along of course I think you like you 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.370
 days supporters of ball today 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.960
 busy heard what was also heard on 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.000
 put the money on then you feel he knows you 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.860
 that Friday is enormously important and 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.570
 yes that is the match will it be 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.180
 sense of honor of their of this me 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.460
 supporter to get the best club in it 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.080
 limburg to be what what you are genk 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.510
 actually should be anyway 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.770
 you feel that comes to play so if 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.080
 player you have to be busy with that 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.800
 and then he just needs extra 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.800
 can motivate
