00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.960
 Meeting point 19 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.119
 The lawsuit I had totally messed Yakuza with my car so 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:23.960
 method 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.910
 and then it happens to me as next to him and I was on foot yes I have 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.110
 I'm actually using his built-in compass against there I think I got it 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.430
 that not a single time, yes, and when did in the BaZ 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.819
 here lives 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:41.589
 the gold Isabel unclear instead of beside their town centers there and the 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.350
 Districts resolved 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.370
 or because the advisor to find yes but otherwise whole now quite where 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.219
 Picture I find your own site 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.950
 if not then stop pigeon way 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 or was it the Wiesbadener? 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.370
 In any case, he still got well in his generation where you still have 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.940
 learned to interpret in the sign of nature who, for example, invest Tina 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.120
 keep white and in the air so you know it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.080
 and where the lever is probably also where is the sun and the more someone is heading 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.140
 not to the south if you like 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.150
 so says 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.940
 yes on the said day 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.880
 cloudy face after 8 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.290
 I have never been there 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 with Honda everyone always said he'll be the SocGen there everyone has to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.620
 I do not even go that far 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.390
 Meadow fast, why do not you do not like it so fast way again 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.900
 Breker 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.020
 while Sarajevo raved about the Aachen Printen yes I am 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.170
 the print manga leisurely in the highly coveted historic architecture alongside 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.430
 Colleen way way to Aachen and at first 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.340
 quite impressed by the landscape 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.850
 because this is a highway 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700
 not always important who you 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.150
 densely wooded I lay my god one looks almost so beautiful 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.310
 in addition to endurance district rain I often think of the Aach and also with us 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.420
 to live 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.970
 Twenty-two hours, I thought 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.970
 but now Marc has to be signposted for a serious 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.629
 such a beautiful city May the whole debate already struck 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.629
 Manuel Noriega, on the other hand, is the right way, we will not have it afterwards 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.769
 Holtwick 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.920
 is an intrigue of the Road Traffic Office 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.209
 or the emirates confirmed that they were traveling when I was not there 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.079
 Government but after a the bride hotel 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.079
 and so shows the landlord before Kassel 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.060
 but in doubt with Keeper not yet acutely Centrum instead 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.839
 Jana has turned on Dennerby 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:52.439
 normal 60 Democrats sparingly because there you have what he does not so synonymous 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.219
 You can also get devices 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.129
 to be broken in orientation would be 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.629
 this is how Aachen enters because he gives me as distance from the destination 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.799
 for 142 kilometers 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.819
 They look very similar but it works again 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:25.569
 because of a quality are created and an individual look and development 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.799
 or how easy the next exit taken now meant to make a commitment 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.799
 Supercomputer Herbert's No here 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.789
 and of course they say Warnecke later 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.139
 widely class 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.049
 also interesting Red 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.689
 although the small box took 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.649
 but the hole Red laughs 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:50.269
 with a sociable architecture his leg is a city rhyme so if that 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.499
 At that time, they wanted a roof terrace 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 but not only more real 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.379
 but keep it going and that was a thug back then
