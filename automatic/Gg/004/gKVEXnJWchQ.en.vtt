00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
objects floating in mid-air so all we're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.339 
objects floating in mid-air so all we're
going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.139> do<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.539> just<00:01:33.959> kind<00:01:34.259> of

going to do is go in and just kind of

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.589 
going to do is go in and just kind of
create<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:35.009> bit<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.219> that<00:01:35.599> that

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
create a little bit of that that

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.469 
create a little bit of that that
background<00:01:37.490> color<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.969> i'm<00:01:39.060> trying<00:01:39.209> to<00:01:39.389> get

stronger rose red and did some
highlighting<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.430> when<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.760> finish

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
highlighting with it so when you finish

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.730 
highlighting with it so when you finish
you're<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.490> have<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.940> right<00:03:54.480> here<00:03:54.840> so

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
you're going to have this right here so

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.290 
you're going to have this right here so
you<00:03:55.890> can<00:03:56.070> see<00:03:56.100> where<00:03:56.460> it's<00:03:56.640> got<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> darker

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
you can see where it's got the darker

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.600 
you can see where it's got the darker
shades<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.690> green<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.590> darker<00:03:59.010> shades<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.430> red

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.670 
shades of green the darker shades of red
and<00:03:59.850> then<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:00.300> got<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.690> shadowing<00:04:01.350> in<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and then it's got that shadowing in the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.650 
and then it's got that shadowing in the
grounding<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.970> let's<00:04:03.240> build<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.720> card<00:04:05.660> so

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
grounding so let's build this card so

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.210 
grounding so let's build this card so
i'm<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.380> take<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.830> one<00:04:08.100> I'm

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
just pops the base for my card is going

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:13.809 
just pops the base for my card is going
to<00:05:05.930> be<00:05:06.080> white<00:05:06.289> I<00:05:10.810> put<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:12.050> on<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:12.289> car<00:05:12.819> and

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
to be white I put this on the car and

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.610 
to be white I put this on the car and
then<00:05:14.060> some<00:05:14.360> dimensionals<00:05:14.960> on<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.229> back<00:05:15.379> side

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
then some dimensionals on the back side

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.459 
then some dimensionals on the back side
of<00:05:15.680> here<00:05:19.060> because<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.300> one<00:05:20.629> normally<00:05:21.229> I<00:05:21.289> just

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
of here because this one normally I just

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.050 
of here because this one normally I just
do<00:05:21.590> dimensionals<00:05:22.099> in<00:05:22.159> the<00:05:22.250> corners<00:05:22.580> but

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
do dimensionals in the corners but

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.390 
do dimensionals in the corners but
because<00:05:23.330> this<00:05:23.509> one<00:05:23.659> has<00:05:23.689> such<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.050> wide<00:05:24.919> middle

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
because this one has such a wide middle

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.850 
because this one has such a wide middle
which<00:05:25.669> is<00:05:25.939> what<00:05:26.150> we<00:05:26.240> all<00:05:26.449> dread<00:05:26.870> right<00:05:27.169> I'm

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
which is what we all dread right I'm

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.080 
which is what we all dread right I'm
just<00:05:28.129> going<00:05:28.279> to<00:05:28.310> go<00:05:28.400> ahead<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.639> put<00:05:28.819> one<00:05:28.969> in

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
just going to go ahead and put one in

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.570 
just going to go ahead and put one in
the<00:05:29.150> middle<00:05:29.300> so<00:05:29.509> we<00:05:29.569> don't<00:05:29.840> have<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.050> flat

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
the middle so we don't have a flat

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.010 
the middle so we don't have a flat
middle<00:05:31.580> which<00:05:31.729> would<00:05:32.089> be<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.330> good<00:05:32.479> part<00:05:32.779> that

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
middle which would be the good part that

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.920 
middle which would be the good part that
anyway<00:05:33.529> we<00:05:33.680> want<00:05:33.860> to<00:05:34.150> don't<00:05:35.150> want<00:05:35.210> any<00:05:35.509> part<00:05:35.839> of
