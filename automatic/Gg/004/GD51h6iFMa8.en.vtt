creeks<00:00:34.440> makes<00:00:35.160> them<00:00:35.340> unbalanced<00:00:35.850> see<00:00:36.090> how

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
creeks makes them unbalanced see how

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.619 
creeks makes them unbalanced see how
it's<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.170> balanced<00:00:38.059> but<00:00:39.059> then<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it's not at all balanced but then it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's not at all balanced but then it
just<00:00:39.690> gets<00:00:39.989> filled<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.440> things<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.219> car

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
just gets filled up things are car

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
just gets filled up things are car
weight<00:00:41.760> heavier<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.379> won't<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
weight heavier so you won't get that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.940 
weight heavier so you won't get that
water<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.420> best<00:00:45.629> way<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.840> found<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.649> do

surface<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.900> high<00:02:24.959> speeds<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.040> that'll<00:02:26.310> also

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
surface at high speeds and that'll also

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.780 
surface at high speeds and that'll also
get<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> water<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.570> tires<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:29.520> let

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
get the water out of your tires so let

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.120 
get the water out of your tires so let
me<00:02:29.880> just<00:02:30.090> switch<00:02:30.360> bits<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.470> slightly

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
me just switch bits here a slightly

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.870 
me just switch bits here a slightly
larger<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.320> uh<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.520> hole<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.820> a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
larger one just so uh the hole is a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
larger one just so uh the hole is a
little<00:02:35.910> bigger<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:37.350> get<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> water<00:02:37.950> out

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
little bigger I can get the water out

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.229 
little bigger I can get the water out
easier<00:02:39.140> now<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:41.070> don't<00:02:41.280> want<00:02:41.489> really<00:02:42.060> big

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
easier now you don't want really big

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.720 
easier now you don't want really big
hole<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:43.680> I'm<00:02:43.890> gonna<00:02:44.070> make<00:02:44.310> mine<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:46.730> don't

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
hole I think I'm gonna make mine I don't

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.040 
hole I think I'm gonna make mine I don't
know<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.950> was<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.630> 3/32<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.019> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
know that was like a 3/32 bit that I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.580 
know that was like a 3/32 bit that I
just<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:54.180> gonna<00:02:54.420> move<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.080> seven

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
just use I'm gonna move up to seven

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.150 
just use I'm gonna move up to seven
sixty<00:02:55.920> fourths<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.160> tiny<00:02:59.400> bit<00:02:59.610> bigger<00:03:04.160> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
sixty fourths just a tiny bit bigger and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:17.060 
sixty fourths just a tiny bit bigger and
that<00:03:05.340> should<00:03:05.850> be<00:03:06.060> good<00:03:15.560> see<00:03:16.560> already<00:03:16.829> it's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
that should be good see already it's

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:42.900 
that should be good see already it's
starting<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.489> drain<00:03:17.790> out

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:04:07.410 

so<00:03:43.910> yeah<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:56.840> want<00:03:57.020> to<00:03:57.080> do<00:03:57.140> that

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:42.770 

that's<00:04:08.050> easy<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.440> lose<00:04:08.620> these<00:04:08.800> holes

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:05:25.059 

there<00:04:43.780> we<00:04:43.840> go

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069
