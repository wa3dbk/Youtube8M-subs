00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760
 but what life are you dragging and Glinda 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 today we have three tables and u found when 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.989
 chose another such product 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.570
 Chinese for release interesting which 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.570
 it was possible to check and that's what's for you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 represent fire it is the same as 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
 armchair fixtures to obtain 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.960
 open fire had a wide 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.360
 spread to the end of the 18th start 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.780
 19th century but until the moment when there were 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.149
 matches are invented today 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.559
 is popular with tourists 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.539
 the simplest fire consists of crystals 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 silicon and cool work is the paper itself 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.740
 little sticks all easy to burn 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.660
 it tells us wikipedia actually 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 she represents the person in general 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:25.289
 don't burn your eyelashes then only 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:28.160
 it remains to check here we see it so that 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:32.209
 blueberries 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.880
 Well, try first here on dry foliage 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:44.660
 little chopsticks and then we'll watch 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.660
 paper grass so 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.200
 what do you even see with us even exclude 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:59.020
 and even sincere views 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:06.800
 but people through it all garbage but so 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:09.250
 so far it has already scattered everything 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.250
 what's happening 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.530
 there is 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.010
 and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.630
 everything 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430
 super 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.120
 straight understood how it works 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:21.770
 but we still have it before antiquity 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.470
 men mined I do not know how much 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.410
 minutes from there 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.480
 Present time here can be half an hour 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.150
 sit and stay without a fire before him 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:39.590
 the thing is better all the minutes now 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:42.830
 the professional has become ours not for nothing 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:56.630
 you are less but this is more similar 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:04:00.910
 so Iâ€™ll light it I hope she should though 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.910
 would fester so we could inflate 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240
 and 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:48.240
 after the corner hour workout with us 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:51.120
 it turns out you can hardly already be seen that is 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.900
 that's so dragged that is should 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:08.730
 to be like this first 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:11.280
 bulge and and in general now there is a little bit 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.800
 better process went and this adaptation 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.540
 we have because either new 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.500
 we now use nuts inside 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.950
 put everything 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.550
 and there we will set fire to the newspaper 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:32.040
 from lei little by little he even goes 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:35.670
 You can still just more expensive 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:41.160
 friends we still did it but not 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:43.200
 unfortunately could shoot 4 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.750
 today is already there and what day has passed 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.510
 after we took the whole thing off 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.820
 here the net result is what 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.340
 need to confirm somehow because there 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.490
 ignition fact was not visible now here 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.080
 this one that exactly should like us 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.570
 then say that it will catch fire and 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:10.250
 Now we will show that using this 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:14.010
 crystal can be lit can be like this 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.990
 success the third time so if 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.480
 will order it take with you to 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.490
 this is definitely not well, we showed 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.370
 what gives the straw too can be lit just 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.530
 well done mom nudity managed to catch but 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.390
 it is real that it is possible to burn 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.390
 wool as you are not putting make growth sets fire 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.099
 Here we are at the end of the second issue 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:40.039
 this time checked the chair is interesting 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.680
 thing but this thing hardly anyone up 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.419
 will use for its intended purpose purely 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.349
 let's say if there are such tourists 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.870
 lovers of rest who exactly want 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:54.550
 remember for how people lived in antiquity 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.840
 or on a desert island and ignite 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.060
 a fire from a spark 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.939
 well, an ordinary person, our time 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.060
 completely unnecessary thing because u 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:07.969
 we have matches we have a lighter up 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.939
 reported much more interesting to everyone 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.169
 thank you all bye 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.830
 dear viewers we are very interested 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.710

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:23.800
 Chinese online stores like this 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:27.740
 Well, the trouble is nothing with us 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.249
 how many are already training, trying nothing 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.879
 not working at all sitting on the rails 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:38.389
 passed this loan is good that you can see here 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:40.990
 the train no longer rides any rusty 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.990
 already
