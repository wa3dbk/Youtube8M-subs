00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
even be an assassin in the game he might

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
even be an assassin in the game he might
be<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> game<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> general<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.150> they

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
be in the game in general but if they

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330 
be in the game in general but if they

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.929 
easter egg now robin is confirmed to a
multiplayer<00:03:55.919> but<00:03:56.189> multiplayer<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:56.909> a

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
multiplayer but multiplayer is a

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.659 
multiplayer but multiplayer is a
different<00:03:57.299> story<00:03:57.449> or<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.259> different<00:03:58.709> universe

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
different story or a different universe

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.670 
different story or a different universe
i<00:03:59.879> guess<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.180> could<00:04:00.269> say<00:04:00.540> from<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.379> story

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
i guess you could say from the story

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.920 
i guess you could say from the story
mode<00:04:01.889> because<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.879> know<00:04:02.970> Robin<00:04:03.449> is<00:04:03.629> in<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
mode because you know Robin is in the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.819 
mode because you know Robin is in the
storm<00:04:04.169> mode<00:04:04.349> but<00:04:05.220> he<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.669> in<00:04:06.530> multiplayer<00:04:07.530> so

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
storm mode but he is in multiplayer so

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.990 
storm mode but he is in multiplayer so
like<00:04:07.949> I<00:04:08.069> multiply<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:08.669> could<00:04:08.790> be<00:04:08.849> seeing

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
like I multiply we could be seeing

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.030 
like I multiply we could be seeing
pretty<00:04:09.689> much<00:04:09.840> anybody<00:04:10.139> I<00:04:10.530> don't<00:04:10.859> think<00:04:10.979> they

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
pretty much anybody I don't think they

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.759 
pretty much anybody I don't think they
should<00:04:11.069> go<00:04:11.250> far<00:04:11.609> out<00:04:11.759> at<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.120> Damian<00:04:12.569> Wayne

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
should go far out at like Damian Wayne

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.580 
definitely do something like that the
next<00:04:57.060> one<00:04:57.240> which<00:04:57.480> is<00:04:57.510> my<00:04:57.750> third<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.110> last<00:04:58.139> it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
next one which is my third to last it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.440 
next one which is my third to last it
should<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.830> bad<00:04:59.220> girl<00:04:59.430> cameo<00:04:59.760> now<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.150> talked

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
should be a bad girl cameo now I talked

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.510 
should be a bad girl cameo now I talked
about<00:05:00.510> background<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:01.110> previous<00:05:01.440> video<00:05:01.590> so

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
about background a previous video so

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.420 
about background a previous video so
people<00:05:03.510> say<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:04.080> Robyn<00:05:04.590> came<00:05:04.800> first<00:05:05.160> and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
people say that Robyn came first and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.000 
people say that Robyn came first and
then<00:05:05.669> Batgirl<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:06.810> if<00:05:07.229> we<00:05:07.290> do<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.860> see<00:05:07.889> a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
then Batgirl so if we do get to see a

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.219 
then Batgirl so if we do get to see a
Robin<00:05:08.520> cameo<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.030> think<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.419> back<00:05:09.630> out<00:05:09.840> only

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
Robin cameo I think the back out only

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.040 
Robin cameo I think the back out only
the<00:05:10.410> only<00:05:10.800> bat<00:05:11.070> girl<00:05:11.310> cameo<00:05:11.910> or<00:05:12.300> each<00:05:12.690> tag<00:05:12.930> we

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
the only bat girl cameo or each tag we

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.080 
the only bat girl cameo or each tag we
should<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.260> seeing<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.770> when<00:05:14.610> we<00:05:14.700> do<00:05:14.850> get<00:05:14.970> to

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
should be seeing is when we do get to

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.400

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
most likely going to be in the

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.600 
most likely going to be in the
multiplayer<00:05:46.350> because<00:05:46.680> her<00:05:46.800> name<00:05:46.979> is<00:05:47.160> set<00:05:47.400> and
