00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
of the others that we've been reviewing

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.529 
of the others that we've been reviewing
this<00:01:54.890> group<00:01:55.250> test<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.030> looking<00:01:56.299> around<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
this group test so looking around the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.419 
this group test so looking around the
camera<00:01:56.899> I'll<00:01:57.649> see<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:57.890> on<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.009> front<00:01:58.280> we've

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
camera I'll see you on the front we've

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.660 
camera I'll see you on the front we've
got<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:59.509> lens<00:01:59.810> aperture<00:02:00.500> which<00:02:00.950> obviously<00:02:01.490> in

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
got the lens aperture which obviously in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.740 
got the lens aperture which obviously in
this<00:02:01.789> case<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.149> closed

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
left and right microphones there is this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.870 
left and right microphones there is this
led<00:02:06.020> starting<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.159> not<00:02:07.399> sure<00:02:07.429> if<00:02:07.610> that's<00:02:07.759> an

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
led starting here not sure if that's an

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.460 
led starting here not sure if that's an
optical<00:02:08.330> sensor<00:02:08.479> or<00:02:08.899> some<00:02:09.229> sort<00:02:09.440> of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
optical sensor or some sort of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.410 
optical sensor or some sort of
illuminating<00:02:10.190> device<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:11.090> might<00:02:11.209> be<00:02:11.360> an

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
illuminating device it might be an

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.050 
illuminating device it might be an
infrared<00:02:11.720> LED<00:02:11.989> therefore<00:02:13.060> illuminating

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
infrared LED therefore illuminating

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.520 
infrared LED therefore illuminating
night<00:02:14.239> shots<00:02:14.540> we'll<00:02:14.780> have<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.110> look<00:02:15.260> at<00:02:15.349> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
night shots we'll have a look at that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.470 
night shots we'll have a look at that
later<00:02:15.730> comment<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.910> top<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.450> a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
later comment on the top here that is a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.800 
later comment on the top here that is a
2/3<00:02:17.989> up<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.260> 2,000<00:02:18.830> times<00:02:18.980> digital<00:02:19.489> zoom<00:02:19.810> he's

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
2/3 up to 2,000 times digital zoom he's

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.410 
2/3 up to 2,000 times digital zoom he's
in<00:02:20.959> actual<00:02:21.290> fact<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.739> 37<00:02:22.459> times<00:02:22.670> optical<00:02:23.390> zoom

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
in actual fact a 37 times optical zoom

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.259 
in actual fact a 37 times optical zoom
so<00:02:23.810> that's<00:02:23.930> pretty<00:02:24.470> pretty<00:02:24.980> good<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.459> camera

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
so that's pretty pretty good for camera

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.410 
so that's pretty pretty good for camera

navigate<00:03:47.510> through<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> menus<00:03:48.200> quite<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> nice

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
navigate through the menus quite a nice

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.960 
navigate through the menus quite a nice
design<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:50.329> works<00:03:50.780> equally<00:03:51.880> with<00:03:52.880> it

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
design that it works equally with it

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.559 
design that it works equally with it
open<00:03:53.090> like<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:54.640> or<00:03:55.640> with<00:03:55.939> the<00:03:56.060> open<00:03:56.390> like

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
open like that or with the open like

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.809 
open like that or with the open like
that<00:03:56.599> although<00:03:57.079> obviously<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.069> buttons

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
that although obviously the buttons

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.239 
that although obviously the buttons
are<00:03:59.329> therefore<00:03:59.569> upside<00:04:00.140> down<00:04:00.379> along<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.040> top

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:01.249 
are therefore upside down along the top

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.330 
are therefore upside down along the top
but<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.150> menus<00:04:02.510> do<00:04:02.769> still<00:04:03.769> reflect<00:04:04.159> what

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
but the menus do still reflect what

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.589 
but the menus do still reflect what
you're<00:04:04.459> doing<00:04:04.670> here<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.120> does<00:04:05.239> actually

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
you're doing here and it does actually

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.069 
you're doing here and it does actually
reverse<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.900> direction<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:08.060> joystick<00:04:08.659> so

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
reverse the direction of the joystick so

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.199 
reverse the direction of the joystick so
quite<00:04:09.319> neat<00:04:10.239> squeeze<00:04:11.239> out<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.620> does<00:04:12.769> close

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
quite neat squeeze out and it does close

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.249 
quite neat squeeze out and it does close
the<00:04:14.209> lens<00:04:14.389> flap<00:04:14.689> on<00:04:15.310> automatically<00:04:17.199> on<00:04:18.199> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
bottom there's a flap over the battery

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.180 
bottom there's a flap over the battery
compartment<00:04:23.500> reasonably<00:04:24.500> large<00:04:24.710> battery

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
compartment reasonably large battery

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.830 
compartment reasonably large battery
should<00:04:25.460> give<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.759> a<00:04:25.820> decent<00:04:26.479> amount<00:04:26.570> of

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
should give you a decent amount of

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.310 
should give you a decent amount of
recording<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.590> playback<00:04:27.740> time<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:29.139> then<00:04:30.139> the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
recording and playback time and then the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320 
recording and playback time and then the
slot<00:04:30.560> for<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.770> SD<00:04:31.099> card<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.639> this<00:04:31.789> model<00:04:32.060> will

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
slot for the SD card and this model will

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.430 
slot for the SD card and this model will
take<00:04:32.599> up<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:33.139> 16<00:04:33.710> gig<00:04:33.949> of<00:04:34.160> HD<00:04:34.580> HD<00:04:35.080> memory<00:04:36.080> cards

take up to 16 gig of HD HD memory cards

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.439 
take up to 16 gig of HD HD memory cards
so<00:04:39.440> quite<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> neat<00:04:40.280> looking<00:04:40.580> piece<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.270> kit

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
so quite a neat looking piece of kit

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.120 
so quite a neat looking piece of kit
slightly<00:04:42.020> larger<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.349> heavier<00:04:42.500> than<00:04:42.860> some<00:04:43.039> of

slightly larger and heavier than some of
the<00:04:43.190> other<00:04:43.310> models<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.090> is<00:04:44.240> reflected

the other models but that is reflected

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.810 
the other models but that is reflected
in<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.960> fact<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.229> we've<00:04:45.410> got<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.770> 37<00:04:46.669> times

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820
