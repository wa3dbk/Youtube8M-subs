00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.460
 good day love with friends in pension 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.710
 from the buyer in.de in cooperation with 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.360
 techno bell i want to explain something about 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.110
 the phenomenon he lives he honestly is that 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.800
 Steer massa with very little energy 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.239
 we only need air around the water 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.739
 are likely to move the whole pond 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.050
 how that works easily 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.920
 we bring the air to about 1 70 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.920
 meter 80 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:12.210
 we have a nice model here 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 glass pvc where me very nicely, we see the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.150
 on an air pump the bubble air in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 a pressure chamber I explain later how 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.439
 the cooling chamber sits together 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.170
 air values ​​blown the small holes 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:39.000
 and the air that rises in the bvc and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.330
 then goes with two pieces became air like that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.230
 fast possible except system 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:51.380
 must be brought why the air when 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:53.630
 The air is prevented then prevented 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:59.930
 also the water when the air is out 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:07.240
 then the water has a free after 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:10.429
 pond or filter through that is whole 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.840
 Great to see how you work it out 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.390
 if you see which one it is 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.730
 complete system as is the honest one 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.660
 assembled 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.800
 we have a pvc in this case 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.150
 the 125 millimeter with two 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 Reductions from 25 to 110 and one 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.510
 small pvc knee for the air on for what 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.840
 We always make the reductions 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.620
 always have a small smaller ring 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.560
 to hold up for the high 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.400
 The thinking ring we pick out that one 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:08.510
 the high through the whole reduction 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:13.040
 how now gets something like me now 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:18.100
 looks then we make the morning from 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.610
 for the pressure chamber and then we do 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.090
 with new pencil three or four 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.239
 fight for the air for in the races 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.080
 make me little holes 0.5 or one 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.550
 millimeter 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.000
 the knowledge is good bigger that is not 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:43.070
 as much as you can 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.200
 Wish the holes are about 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.120
 between half an inch and one 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:57.850
 centimeter apart what you then 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:00.440
 Gets is what this looks like with 120 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.080
 Air pump with 20 watts can be approximately 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.080
 210 to 12,000 liters per hour 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.230
 move 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.290
 You can also sit more then you sit down 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.470
 a heavier air pump on but 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.680
 we try with too little power possible 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.980
 too much water as possible by the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.680
 to shape the whole system 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:31.790
 we already have very nice corpse 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:36.050
 seen with air pumps nevertheless with 36 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.620
 watt and the 35 36 thousand liters per 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.020
 hour 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:53.000
 composite will all witnessed what on 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:55.580
 our forum.de and is shown like that 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.020
 that we are all on a very energy 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:05.290
 cheap way to save electricity and a lot 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.290
 make water through the pond 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.550
 bye bye next time
