and the ATT networks combined also

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
and the ATT networks combined also
that's<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.200> straighttalk<00:01:07.200> uses<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.890> has

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that's what straighttalk uses so it has

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.260 
that's what straighttalk uses so it has
really<00:01:08.189> great<00:01:08.400> reception<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:09.150> much

bars<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> i<00:01:11.460> don't<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.110> dropped<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
