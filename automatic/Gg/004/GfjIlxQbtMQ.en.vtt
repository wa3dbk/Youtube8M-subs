a<00:01:08.400> 1940's<00:01:09.330> John<00:01:09.630> Deere<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:11.010> no<00:01:11.310> idea<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.960> be

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a 1940's John Deere I have no idea to be

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.399 
a 1940's John Deere I have no idea to be
honest<00:01:14.150> what<00:01:15.150> year<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.509> he<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.840> completely

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
honest what year but he was completely

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.230 
honest what year but he was completely
right<00:01:16.560> about<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.220> being<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.490> John<00:01:17.700> Deere<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
right about it being a John Deere so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.749 
right about it being a John Deere so
he's<00:01:18.420> probably<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> year<00:01:19.380> too

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
he's probably right about the year too

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:28.030 
he's probably right about the year too
but<00:01:21.590> here<00:01:22.590> maybe<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.430> here

know<00:02:48.970> what<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.180> does<00:02:49.329> I<00:02:49.510> don't<00:02:49.569> know<00:02:49.720> anything

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
know what it does I don't know anything

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.860 
know what it does I don't know anything
about<00:02:50.170> farming<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.450> probably

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
about farming but this is it probably

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.580 
about farming but this is it probably
some<00:02:52.989> sort<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.079> drive<00:02:56.349> it<00:02:56.560> like

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
some sort of like when you drive it like

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.099 
some sort of like when you drive it like
cuts<00:02:57.549> everything<00:02:59.040> just<00:03:00.040> lays<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> all<00:03:00.549> out<00:03:00.579> so

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
cuts everything just lays it all out so

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.030 
cuts everything just lays it all out so
probably<00:03:02.109> one<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.350> those<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.769> has<00:03:02.889> like

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
probably one of those and it has like

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.789 
probably one of those and it has like
little<00:03:03.190> pounds<00:03:04.109> chart<00:03:05.109> right<00:03:05.470> here<00:03:07.590> yeah<00:03:08.590> and

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
little pounds chart right here yeah and

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.050 
little pounds chart right here yeah and
then<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.700> another<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.799> towing<00:03:12.060> thing

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
then this is another little towing thing

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.289 
then this is another little towing thing
you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.329> see<00:03:13.510> how<00:03:13.630> old<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.109> based<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
you can see how old it is based on the

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.199 
you can see how old it is based on the
stages<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.569> wood<00:03:16.780> rotting<00:03:18.900> pretty<00:03:19.900> cool<00:03:21.209> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
stages of wood rotting pretty cool and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.879 
stages of wood rotting pretty cool and
over<00:03:22.420> here<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:25.420> no<00:03:25.600> idea<00:03:25.630> what<00:03:26.049> this<00:03:26.170> is<00:03:28.889> it

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
over here I have no idea what this is it

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.520 
over here I have no idea what this is it
might<00:03:30.100> have<00:03:30.220> attached<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:31.329> over<00:03:31.569> there

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.860

in the comments they'll be pretty cool I

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.050 
in the comments they'll be pretty cool I
have<00:03:40.389> no<00:03:40.540> idea

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
have no idea

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.440 
have no idea
all<00:03:43.060> right<00:03:43.209> this<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.569> another<00:03:44.069> some<00:03:45.069> sort<00:03:45.340> of

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
all right this is another some sort of

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.300 
all right this is another some sort of
equipment<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.870> don't<00:03:47.620> know<00:03:47.709> what<00:03:47.889> kind<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.190> is

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
equipment I don't know what kind it is

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.390 
equipment I don't know what kind it is
probably<00:03:49.380> put<00:03:50.380> up<00:03:50.500> something<00:03:51.099> right<00:03:51.220> here

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
probably put up something right here

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.380 
probably put up something right here
soft<00:03:54.150> ground<00:03:55.910> or<00:03:56.910> stony<00:03:57.620> medium<00:03:58.640> art<00:03:59.640> oh<00:04:00.150> that

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
soft ground or stony medium art oh that

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.290 
soft ground or stony medium art oh that
must<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.599> like<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.810> setting<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:02.700> Joe

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
must be like a setting on it you Joe

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.449 
must be like a setting on it you Joe
no<00:04:03.450> here's<00:04:03.660> John<00:04:03.930> right<00:04:04.200> here<00:04:05.780> John<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.050> then

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
no here's John right here John and then

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.720 
no here's John right here John and then
it<00:04:08.459> breaks<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.810> broken<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.440> that's<00:04:11.430> John

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
it breaks it's broken so that's John

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.490

Deere<00:04:11.970> -<00:04:12.150> I'm<00:04:12.360> pretty<00:04:12.900> sure<00:04:12.989> everything<00:04:13.379> out

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
Deere - I'm pretty sure everything out

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.020 
Deere - I'm pretty sure everything out
here<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.739> John<00:04:14.010> Deere<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.549> must<00:04:14.760> have<00:04:14.879> bought

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
here is John Deere it must have bought

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.030 
here is John Deere it must have bought
it<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.330> big<00:04:15.569> set<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:17.780> don't<00:04:18.780> know<00:04:18.889> so<00:04:19.889> that's

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
it like a big set I don't know so that's

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.080 
it like a big set I don't know so that's
that<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:21.180> here's<00:04:21.449> another<00:04:21.570> piece<00:04:22.820> this<00:04:23.820> one

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
that and here's another piece this one

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.159 
that and here's another piece this one
looks<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.570> sophisticated<00:04:25.320> than<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.250> rest<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.420 

don't<00:04:31.169> know<00:04:31.260> what<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.470> does<00:04:31.620> again<00:04:31.919> there's<00:04:32.340> a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
don't know what it does again there's a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.560 
don't know what it does again there's a
tree<00:04:32.729> growing<00:04:33.000> through<00:04:33.120> it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
tree growing through it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.050 
tree growing through it
how<00:04:33.750> old<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:38.419> probably<00:04:39.419> John<00:04:39.720> Deere

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
how old it is probably John Deere

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.969 
how old it is probably John Deere
another<00:04:42.060> one<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.479> what<00:04:42.690> seems<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.169> be<00:04:43.320> down

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
another one of what seems to be down

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:51.980 
another one of what seems to be down
there<00:04:48.530> all<00:04:49.530> right<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:49.889> is<00:04:50.190> this<00:04:50.810> looks<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.960> be

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
there all right this is this looks to be

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.939 
there all right this is this looks to be
the<00:04:52.110> most<00:04:52.410> intact<00:04:53.190> piece<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:55.410> just<00:04:55.650> looks<00:04:55.830> to

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
the most intact piece it just looks to

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.680 
the most intact piece it just looks to
be<00:04:56.070> kind<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.370> like<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.610> storage<00:04:56.940> tank<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.510> some

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
be kind of like a storage tank of some

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.550 
be kind of like a storage tank of some
sort<00:04:57.990> I<00:04:58.910> don't<00:04:59.910> know<00:05:01.130> what<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.250> does<00:05:02.789> but<00:05:02.820> it

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
sort I don't know what it does but it

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.200 
sort I don't know what it does but it
extends<00:05:04.560> kind<00:05:04.800> of<00:05:04.950> far<00:05:05.190> out<00:05:05.430> from<00:05:05.910> where<00:05:06.090> the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
extends kind of far out from where the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:19.659 
extends kind of far out from where the
actual<00:05:06.600> tank<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:09.870> kind<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.080> see

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
it's gonna be dark and Tre in there yeah

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.460 
it's gonna be dark and Tre in there yeah
again<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.800> have<00:05:35.370> no<00:05:35.550> idea<00:05:35.580> what<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.030> does<00:05:39.470> no

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
something I don't know and then over

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.090 
something I don't know and then over
here<00:05:54.690> is<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.260> last<00:05:55.500> piece

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
here is the last piece

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.740 
here is the last piece
it<00:05:56.220> looks<00:05:56.490> like<00:05:56.610> it's<00:05:56.850> facing<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.389> way<00:05:57.600> it

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.780 
should be like scrape like it looks like
a<00:06:01.620> scraper<00:06:01.979> some<00:06:02.400> sort<00:06:03.650> but<00:06:07.550> it<00:06:08.550> looks<00:06:08.729> like

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
a scraper some sort but it looks like

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.670

they dragged it here obviously it's a

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.920 
they dragged it here obviously it's a
big<00:06:10.919> chunk<00:06:11.220> out<00:06:11.400> of<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.580> ground<00:06:11.820> so<00:06:12.150> I'm<00:06:12.720> not

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
big chunk out of the ground so I'm not

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.650 
big chunk out of the ground so I'm not
sure<00:06:13.490> if<00:06:14.490> that's<00:06:14.669> what<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:14.970> does<00:06:15.090> or<00:06:15.270> not<00:06:15.389> but

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
sure if that's what it does or not but

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.920 
sure if that's what it does or not but
yeah<00:06:15.930> that's<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.260> last<00:06:16.410> piece<00:06:17.720> and<00:06:18.720> that's

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
yeah that's the last piece and that's

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.229
