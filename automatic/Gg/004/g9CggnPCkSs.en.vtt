00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.600 
it looks like there's a croc a cool kind
of<00:01:49.020> croc<00:01:49.350> print<00:01:49.820> kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> back<00:01:51.810> so

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
of croc print kind of on the back so

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
of croc print kind of on the back so
those<00:01:53.610> 12<00:01:54.060> those<00:01:54.420> those<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:54.810> our<00:01:55.049> must<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
those 12 those those are our must I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.810 
those 12 those those are our must I
think<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.640> an

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
think that's going to be that's an

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
think that's going to be that's an
instant<00:01:57.149> salad<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.840> those<00:01:58.049> are<00:01:58.320> hopefully

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
instant salad and if those are hopefully

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
instant salad and if those are hopefully
those<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:59.189> mass-produced<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.090> think

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
those are mass-produced because I think

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.200 
those are mass-produced because I think
those<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> fours<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.340> definitely<00:02:03.000> cop

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
those in the fours are definitely cop

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.840 
those in the fours are definitely cop
