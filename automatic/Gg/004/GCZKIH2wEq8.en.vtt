00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
want to draw you a sports car and you

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.730 
want to draw you a sports car and you
want<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> start<00:00:13.380> off<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:15.030> wheel

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
want to start off with the wheel

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.080 
want to start off with the wheel
something<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.699> want<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> go

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
something like that and you want to go

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.590 
something like that and you want to go
kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.960> where<00:00:20.119> that's<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> width<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
kind of where that's the width of the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.429 
kind of where that's the width of the
cut<00:00:21.750> wheel<00:00:22.050> two<00:00:22.470> three<00:00:23.600> four<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.990> then<00:00:25.019> draw

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
cut wheel two three four and then draw

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.970 
cut wheel two three four and then draw
another<00:00:25.710> wheel<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.210> same<00:00:27.710> kind<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
another wheel the same kind of at the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.970 
another wheel the same kind of at the
back<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:30.420> three<00:00:30.900> four<00:00:31.260> five<00:00:31.619> something

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
back one two three four five something

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.749 
back one two three four five something
like<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
like that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.180 
like that
let's<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.600> angle<00:00:33.989> basically<00:00:34.530> bring

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
let's get that angle basically bring

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
let's get that angle basically bring
your<00:00:35.790> wheel<00:00:36.180> arches<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:38.420> right<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:40.020> down

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
your wheel arches and right right down

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.490 
your wheel arches and right right down
low<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> get<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> pin<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:42.500> down

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
low you want to get this pin right down

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.810 
low you want to get this pin right down
there<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.680> bring<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.160> forward<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
there and and bring this forward a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.840 
there and and bring this forward a
little<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> wheel<00:00:50.219> parts<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:50.820> be

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
little way and this wheel parts will be

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.200 
little way and this wheel parts will be
there<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> kind<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.250> bite<00:00:53.730> in

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
there and do a kind of a little bite in

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.319 
there and do a kind of a little bite in
there<00:00:55.550> which<00:00:56.550> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> makes<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> bit

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there which kind of makes it look a bit

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.549 
there which kind of makes it look a bit
cool

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
cool

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.360 
cool
wheel<00:00:59.309> arch<00:00:59.670> there<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.829> door<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.219> going

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
wheel arch there now your door is going

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.240 
wheel arch there now your door is going
to<00:01:02.460> come<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> bottom

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
to come about there and on the bottom

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
to come about there and on the bottom
they're<00:01:05.519> set<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.570> point<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.770> third

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
they're set up to that point that third

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
they're set up to that point that third
point<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.880> also<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> come<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.930> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
point there is also to come up there so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
point there is also to come up there so
from<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:12.799> swing<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.100> line<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.970> over

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
from here you can swing a line up over

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.380 
from here you can swing a line up over
the<00:01:15.630> wheel<00:01:15.840> arch<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.530> come<00:01:16.820> down<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> bit<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the wheel arch and come down a bit and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.539 
the wheel arch and come down a bit and
swing<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:20.180> over<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.830> that's<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> part<00:01:23.400> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
swing it over the that's kind of part of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.719 
swing it over the that's kind of part of
that<00:01:23.670> wheel<00:01:23.880> arch<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> rear<00:01:26.250> intake

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that wheel arch and the rear intake

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.370 
that wheel arch and the rear intake
because<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> real<00:01:27.479> rear<00:01:27.920> engine

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
because you can have a real rear engine

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.510 
because you can have a real rear engine
so<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.740> bit<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.340> angle

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
so you want that bit more of an angle

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.260 
so you want that bit more of an angle
there<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.630> sweep<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:35.270> like

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there and then can sweep that back like

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.700 
there and then can sweep that back like
that<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:38.450> bring<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> fitting<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that and then bring that as a fitting in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.130 
that and then bring that as a fitting in
nicely<00:01:40.860> -<00:01:41.220> yeah<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.390> focused<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
nicely - yeah it's not focused as it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
nicely - yeah it's not focused as it
they<00:01:43.259> were<00:01:43.320> else<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.740> bring<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.729> over<00:01:46.909> like

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
they were else but bring that over like

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.020 
they were else but bring that over like
