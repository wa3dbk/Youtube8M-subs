00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.980
 welcome together to a new episode 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.070
 the computer tips news from 2016 should be 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 in all ic trains the german railways 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.250
 free wifi that gave that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.350
 company now known 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 and not just for the first one 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 also for the second class in the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.099
 It was always like that last time 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.490
 only through expensive telekom hotspots ins 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.769
 Internet should arrive soon 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 be final 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 In addition, some ic trains are still with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 equipped with the new internet technology 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.629
 So you can expect that there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 is introduced to this feature 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.140
 with the service seems the German 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.969
 were a bit on the Fernbus 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.860
 market where it is now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.879
 already common is free wifi 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.129
 offer 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.120
 and there are the rides 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.129
 much cheaper there are news too 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 windows 10 in march preview from 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 Windows 10 understands the language assistant 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.219
 court an is also German that means one 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.110
 can also in German just by the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.909
 operating system navigate as well 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.869
 Some tablet adjustments have been made 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.030
 performed 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.610
 Two things should be in the last 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.830
 weeks for a stir regarding windows 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 10 there was, for example, a screenshot of the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.080
 program by windows 10 show 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.960
 should meanwhile come out that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.270
 the whole of microsoft was just and just 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.799
 to be published was to vote 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.110
 the user and one assumes that the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.880
 program especially then just not in the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.170
 final version of windows ten 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 be inserted 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 then there was an utterance of one 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.820
 microsoft managers who promised that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.700
 You can also pirate a free one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.130
 one year version of windows 10 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.049
 wool 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.180
 then many media representatives said 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.479
 interesting step what has microsoft 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.850
 in front 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.210
 meanwhile it was from microsoft though 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.159
 already denied several times 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.659
 They said that you are just that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.939
 you just pirate that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.040
 just want to make one easier 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.520
 corresponding version a full version 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.080
 to buy through the windows store 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.030
 google will use its search algorithm as well 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.010
 in the future do not disclose in the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.300
 last time politicians and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.910
 Entrepreneurs always the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.930
 release of this 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.209
 search algorithm because one fears that 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.980
 the own products preferentially treated 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.280
 that is higher up in the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.780
 search results are displayed and 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.530
 That's why we continue to compete 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.380
 below 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.660
 Well google responded now and said 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.550
 that you will not publish that 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.250
 because you just feared that it would be too 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.930
 easy is the own website quite far 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.390
 top of the search results too 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.459
 place 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.739
 However, one emphasizes that the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.950
 Search criteria constantly updated 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.610
 and on the web master blogs 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.470
 also be published and then on 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.330
 finish a little youtube theme 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.620
 At the moment she is in full swing 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.910
 somehow a little bit too 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.010
 to goad 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.500
 so a bit to offer in 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.620
 quotes and that's how it started 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.489
 a bit with bh intake reimann before that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.579
 Of course, too 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.100
 then it went on with the gang and 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.140
 other larger youtube and 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.470
 meanwhile, there is also between 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.850
 Rang and the hole has a new one 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.859
 I would say quality reached 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.170
 I would be interested in burning something 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.870
 you as a spectator actually say so 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.880
 how do you find this dispute in 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.850
 quotation marks under the youtube 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.900
 Personally, I find it rather 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.420
 Everyone has to be counterproductive 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.590
 decide for yourself 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.480
 I would be interested in burning something 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.739
 you say so, write your opinion 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.060
 below in the comments 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 that was it from the computer 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.239
 tips news for this week at the side 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.250
 you will find the last ones as usual 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.680
 It is also followed by computer chips 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.350
 the city skylines review of the game year 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.480
 very successful below you will find 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.030
 because still our social media channels 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.260
 facebook twitter google plus and if it is 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.019
 you liked then applies as always 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.519
 diligently and industriously comments 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.359
 recommend us further and if that still 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.850
 did not do it 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.829
 then of course subscribe to us 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.690
 I hope we see each other the next 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.690
 I'll say goodbye until then
