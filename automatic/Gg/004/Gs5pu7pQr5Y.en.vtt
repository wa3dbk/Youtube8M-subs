00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.449
 chossat the acquirer and I hope you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.859
 all right so we end up 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.779
 today for a new tutorial 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.529
 so before I start I think so 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.509
 you have noticed 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 I created my own lay out what 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.440
 I dare say that I did not do it in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.419
 2 seconds so here I have a little bit 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.730
 galley and suddenly yes I held software 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.200
 so we need to dedicate the interview 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.880
 that he took for his birthday so 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.340
 able to do it down I took the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.920
 camtasia software so I think everything 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 the world knows it veiled so I hope 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.820
 please tell me mankono earth that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.679
 would really make me happy 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.199
 brief truce of blah I explained you 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:39.239
 really what is this tutorial the 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.039
 just small precision this frozen tutor saw 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 nowhere 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.399
 so I create them myself and I would like 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.679
 not to take it 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.999
 So thank you davance and also I'm not 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.350
 at my house so if you hear 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.260
 sounds of torhout and where it's all to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.969
 is normal so to start everything 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.280
 first in the basket of ricoh with 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.069
 added beans 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.800
 normal so short is a wooden box 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.050
 with helicos in so what 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.480
 it is 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.890
 it is part of the Japanese objects on 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 can only have them on the cartridge 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.800
 Japanese wholesale so or else you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 must try to find people 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.820
 Japanese who can be make you 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.230
 donate or sell you this item if you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.880
 so here's me personally I 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.610
 them by my best friend we that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.600
 so here's a dedication to them there are 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.760
 mosquitoes who want to enter the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.110
 video I'm sorry so here is the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.400
 second Japanese object is the maquis 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.440
 so the maquis for me is a 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.140
 object that I overkill so I find 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.000
 that he goes with everything obviously one to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.200
 the alga back with the fish rice 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 inside so frankly it gives 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 hungry so frankly would quit I 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.360
 finds exceptional frankly I 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.730
 love it so here and finally to finish 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 my third object on the other hand 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.750
 I do not know if a Japanese object or 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 americans kill sorry so if there is a 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.660
 crazy who knows 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.180
 so if there is to say in 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.130
 comment it would be nice then the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.770
 fruit cocktail it drinks like a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.960
 coffee so that's it's just a kind 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.760
 small noise-like side when you 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.750
 drink 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.570
 personally I find these flip flops this 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.460
 really nice object 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.900
 I often use wifi as it finally 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.580
 there are quite a few people who are these 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.350
 objects anyway and like that in the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.420
 four to be able to do that and frankly I 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.260
 find it really ready mlle coulon so 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.510
 So here we go to objects 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.390
 streep personally I have not them 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.770
 all 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.750
 so I will show you first the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.970
 different balloons that I have and their 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 different colours 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.060
 so here we have the orange bunny balloon 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 then we have the blue rabbit balloon the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.340
 balloon heart orange balloon pink heart 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.360
 so this one is my favorite 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:02.430
 this favorite ball of all the game the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.550
 red balloon very simple the ball in the heart 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.180
 yellow and here I think we did the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.989
 tower 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.000
 I just forgot the sky blue balloon 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.400
 so here you see there are different 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 colors and different balloons I find 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.650
 it's really cool but my favorite is 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.290
 still the pink heart balloon so 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.760
 immediately we will go to the mill 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.459
 so the mills for me it's me 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.150
 seems like I have 4 so here we have the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.760
 mill blue sky with yellow water at 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.100
 red mill 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.690
 the pink mill with yellow too and 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.140
 that was a mosquitoes fail me 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.810
 sting so now we have it all 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.680
 immediately gone to the hurt why 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.099
 mention the tropical ice melon dkhil 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.430
 2 go so and then balls class 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.349
 with raspberry with a ball then the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.769
 ice cream a little special fruit ice cream 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.530
 candied 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.480
 so that's basic ice I think 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.489
 with them fruits on them or 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.790
 debauched not too much so I left us 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.250
 do a little high and we have ice cream 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.260
 lemon mint so with mint in 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.540
 under and the lemon which taking to 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.340
 go ice cream in the corneas so 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.039
 first of all we go to the chocolate corner 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.449
 have this strawberry corner but as I see 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.709
 that there is white the other I would say that 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.049
 it's rather strawberry vanilla 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.630
 I find this ice is rather nice 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.960
 then a pistachio corner agreement with 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.000
 a little bit of vanilla and finally the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 simple vanilla corner 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.330
 so that's it for all the objects 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.199
 streetpass and rare objects 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.180
 totally I will make you a little 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:42.680
 teleportation and find yourself in the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.530
 piece I call so to finish we have them 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.750
 rare items that are Japanese dishes 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.490
 so I will not show you 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.889
 with my style and because I find that 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.960
 not clean so we do where I am 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.419
 currently we have 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.800
 no pardon where I am we have the cake 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:04.759
 of rice then we have the tray of sushi 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:08.150
 there we have the theater dish then 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.160
 here we have the date range dish is just 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.150
 next to the blah of the date range dish 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.520
 we have the dish of five picks 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.370
 so this video is coming to an end 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.229
 so I specify everything I have you 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.449
 shown this is not a genre 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:27.259
 absolutely all the rare items in the game 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:30.009
 obviously there are others that I you 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.180
 just did not show up so that's it 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.550
 it's just that I'm not quite 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.669
 sure I'm waiting for your opinion on the lay out 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.410

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.410
