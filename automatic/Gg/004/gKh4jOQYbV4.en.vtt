00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
to other full face helmets but turn it

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.350 
to other full face helmets but turn it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
around and there's a real difference

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.570 
around and there's a real difference
look<00:02:07.720> at<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:07.960> that's<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.500> revised<00:02:09.040> ER<00:02:09.070> that

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
look at that that's a revised ER that

out<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:15.760> helmet<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.239> myself<00:04:16.630> let's<00:04:17.590> go

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.779 

well<00:04:24.819> two<00:04:25.300> things<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.720> notice<00:04:26.110> right<00:04:26.259> away

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
well two things you notice right away

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.339 
well two things you notice right away
first<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:28.300> rear<00:04:28.539> view<00:04:28.750> image<00:04:29.080> in<00:04:29.229> your

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
first the rear view image in your

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.260 
first the rear view image in your
periphery<00:04:29.919> takes<00:04:30.219> a<00:04:30.400> bit<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.610> getting<00:04:30.699> used<00:04:30.969> to

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
periphery takes a bit of getting used to

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.800 
periphery takes a bit of getting used to
and<00:04:31.689> second<00:04:32.349> the<00:04:32.770> helmet<00:04:33.129> is<00:04:33.280> very<00:04:33.580> quiet<00:04:33.969> its

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
and second the helmet is very quiet its

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.839 
and second the helmet is very quiet its
aerodynamic<00:04:35.620> design<00:04:35.949> substantially

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
aerodynamic design substantially

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.469 
aerodynamic design substantially
reducing<00:04:37.449> noisy<00:04:38.020> air<00:04:38.229> flow<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:39.699> few<00:04:40.240> minutes

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
reducing noisy air flow a few minutes

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.600 
reducing noisy air flow a few minutes
down<00:04:40.629> the<00:04:40.689> road<00:04:40.889> everything<00:04:41.889> seems<00:04:42.219> to<00:04:42.340> fall

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
down the road everything seems to fall

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.270 
down the road everything seems to fall
into<00:04:42.789> place<00:04:43.319> have<00:04:44.319> to<00:04:44.349> say<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.770> helmet<00:04:45.129> is

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
into place have to say this helmet is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.800 
into place have to say this helmet is
very<00:04:45.580> impressive<00:04:45.969> it<00:04:46.180> might<00:04:46.360> look<00:04:46.569> like<00:04:46.629> a

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
very impressive it might look like a

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.649 
very impressive it might look like a
regular<00:04:47.080> helmet<00:04:47.590> but<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.729> small<00:04:49.150> mirror<00:04:49.509> at

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
regular helmet but this small mirror at

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.179 
regular helmet but this small mirror at
the<00:04:49.719> top<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.139> my<00:04:50.259> peripheral<00:04:50.680> vision<00:04:50.710> allows

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
the top of my peripheral vision allows

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:52.830 
the top of my peripheral vision allows
me<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.490> see<00:04:51.639> exactly<00:04:52.030> what's<00:04:52.360> going<00:04:52.419> on<00:04:52.719> behind

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
me to see exactly what's going on behind

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.680 
me to see exactly what's going on behind
at<00:04:53.199> any<00:04:53.319> given<00:04:53.560> time<00:04:54.030> which<00:04:55.030> is<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.180> bike<00:04:55.449> rider

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
at any given time which is a bike rider

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.640 
at any given time which is a bike rider
is<00:04:56.500> incredibly<00:04:57.069> important

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.710 

it's<00:05:00.650> early<00:05:01.070> days<00:05:01.280> but<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.970> team<00:05:02.210> see<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.480> big

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
it's early days but the team see a big

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.050 
it's early days but the team see a big
future<00:05:03.050> for<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.470> technology<00:05:04.100> believing<00:05:04.970> it

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
future for the technology believing it

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.880 
future for the technology believing it
can<00:05:05.240> be<00:05:05.360> adapted<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.990> any<00:05:06.140> kind<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.650> helmet

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
can be adapted to any kind of helmet

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:15.310 
can be adapted to any kind of helmet
even<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.700> fighter<00:05:08.000> pilot<00:05:13.600> now<00:05:14.600> though<00:05:14.870> it's

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
even a fighter pilot now though it's
