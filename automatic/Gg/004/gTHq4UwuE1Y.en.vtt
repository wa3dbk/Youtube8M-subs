the<00:04:53.820> payoff<00:04:54.000> we've<00:04:54.930> seen<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:55.380> now<00:04:55.560> when<00:04:56.070> the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
the payoff we've seen that now when the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.160 
the payoff we've seen that now when the
opening<00:04:56.490> shot<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.790> age<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.150> Ultron<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.720> huge

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
opening shot of age of Ultron is a huge

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.590 
opening shot of age of Ultron is a huge
battle<00:04:58.410> scene<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.310> just<00:04:59.820> as<00:05:00.030> awesome<00:05:00.210> and

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
battle scene that is just as awesome and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.960 
battle scene that is just as awesome and
well<00:05:00.750> choreographed<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.740> cool<00:05:02.100> as<00:05:02.490> the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
well choreographed and cool as the

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.230 
well choreographed and cool as the
ending<00:05:03.480> of<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.990> first<00:05:04.200> movie<00:05:04.710> then<00:05:05.520> it's

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
ending of the first movie then it's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.710 
ending of the first movie then it's
weirdly<00:05:07.250> deflated<00:05:08.250> in<00:05:08.400> comparison<00:05:09.150> despite

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
weirdly deflated in comparison despite

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.960 
weirdly deflated in comparison despite
the<00:05:09.840> fact<00:05:10.020> that<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.230> is<00:05:10.350> really<00:05:10.680> super<00:05:11.190> good<00:05:11.550> so

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
the fact that it is really super good so

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.940 
the fact that it is really super good so
after<00:05:12.210> thinking<00:05:12.390> about<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.690> for<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.840> while<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.260> do

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
after thinking about it for a while I do

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.870 
after thinking about it for a while I do
prefer<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.490> second<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:15.150> over<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.660> first
