00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.860
 room but all these mini software and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.439
 today I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.509
 tutorial so I'm going to introduce you 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:22.500
 actually a software that I have you 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:26.609
 spoken in in the memory modules 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.650
 choice cpi z to know a little what is this 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.949
 that there is in my computer in fact 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.430
 so I'll put you the link got in the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.500
 description here and then so you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.360
 go go to this site and you go to the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 Download 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 so it will necessarily be in English it's 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.600
 not very serious is not much to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600
 understand 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:57.050
 then we will open his landscapes 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.480
 leave it to the CPU z this is the cp 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.159
 so his processors me I put 5 1 he 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.909
 5 3 me 1 3570 when to arrive bridge 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.680
 so it's the best processors in 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.240
 May - I actually have so they are very 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.259
 performing 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.640
 here I advise you if there was 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.920
 maybe I'll make you a little 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.110
 entrusts even the best when I 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.940
 taken and all that but I will make a video 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.490
 outside so not a screenshot 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.800
 but I will show you roughly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.880
 will do a little set up and worthily in 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.240
 comments if you want a little 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.770
 set up and jean ferrat so so I 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:38.149
 people several people who me 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:42.050
 often say you then them what is this 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.479
 that there is there will be what the cache 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.039
 so here's the cash iap has enjoined to 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.770
 see I do not really know who 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.050
 besides a lot of people you 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.860
 will say without what is it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.270
 I do not know then the mine beaufor 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.799
 so this is the map 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.259
 to the motherboard was not 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.609
 nonsense the gigabyte motherboard 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.820
 seo technology 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.979
 finally we've got there 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.759
 dh too slow from 3h 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.319
 here it is a very good motherboard 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.519
 so i see and so pci express x16 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:25.340
 in la la is the memory so 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:31.790
 libertine ddr3 16 1 gigabyte that I have 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.980
 then spdc slows to start 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.680
 so much I do not know why it's not so 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.900
 we make an idea 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.530
 so I do not know and that's the map 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
 graphic 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.489
 no I have an image of radios and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.920
 7900 series of 3 I opted very 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.910
 good graphics card too so that's it 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.620
 I'm done with this software 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 today to more for a neighbor you 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.769
 evening and especially to diderot and condorcet 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.230
 game finally if I do a setup for also 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.549
 his thousand subscribers as high as I have 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.319
 not really celebrate I can do a 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.450
 video has not and I would like to do but 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.739
 I do not have too many ideas here so do it 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.739
 there's more for a next and tutorials
