like<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.340> first<00:01:40.549> book<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:40.909> then<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.150> series

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
like the first book and then the series

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.510 
like the first book and then the series
just<00:01:41.630> sort<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.869> swiftly<00:01:42.740> went<00:01:42.950> downhill<00:01:43.130> for

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
just sort of swiftly went downhill for

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.760 
just sort of swiftly went downhill for
them<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.210> actually<00:01:44.930> I'm<00:01:45.170> kind<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.590> the

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
them but I actually I'm kind of the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.990 
them but I actually I'm kind of the
opposite<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.220> feel<00:01:46.369> like<00:01:46.490> I'm<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.729> only<00:01:46.850> one

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
opposite I feel like I'm the only one

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.030 
opposite I feel like I'm the only one
who<00:01:47.149> thinks<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:48.170> first<00:01:48.380> one<00:01:48.619> was<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:48.860> bit

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
who thinks that the first one was a bit

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.920 
who thinks that the first one was a bit
sort<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.340> sadly<00:01:49.610> lacking<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.360> any<00:01:50.509> kind<00:01:50.810> of

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
sort of sadly lacking in any kind of

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.050 
sort of sadly lacking in any kind of
like<00:01:51.140> depth<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.710> then<00:01:52.250> they<00:01:52.369> just<00:01:52.579> got<00:01:52.790> better

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
like depth and then they just got better

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.300 
like depth and then they just got better
and<00:01:53.210> better<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.780> loved<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.740> third<00:01:54.950> book

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
and better and I loved the third book

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.950 
and better and I loved the third book
but<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.790> really<00:01:56.030> love<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.299> series<00:01:56.540> I'm<00:01:56.810> not
