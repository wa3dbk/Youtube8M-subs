 do not play me no 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.650
 Today I came just to show the items that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.439
 received exemption from the imi that I would ask 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.560
 so I want to make the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.899
 pj just to show even then 30 plays 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:42.149
 3g to 30 days of chaos stated dcg 30 days 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:44.610
 plays 3d 3d remembers the day of fame of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.309
 2003 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.500
 Smoke as you like 30 days of fame 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.320
 two g1 commands to make a game 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.820
 place of the hour of the hour ba gaiman 30 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 no fee had 30 of three plays 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.760
 goals but here is 30 days of crisis 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.720
 eg 30 days out of 90 already had a little bit 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.590
 here you already had it here too 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 the drica said by bmc rose but what 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.259
 here to see a little more than I 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.530
 I found tech 1,200 a game keeps 30 more 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 days and now 26 up from the team 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 fight honored the 30 days in machete 11 30 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.470
 days I did not miss their imea this month 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:42.439
 standard that characters in the range of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:42.439
 show 120 very advanced Ukrainian only 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.380
 extra fast explosive and needs 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.770
 bullet proof and extra life and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.720
 here ammunition clothes and fortified also 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.479
 so this I hope you have enjoyed 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.869
 If you liked solix in the game if 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.969
 disconnect and technically say that 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.890
 it was a video that had more traffic 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.820
 so it does not necessarily have to be 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.009
 layman and design 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.289
 but if you find it necessary I leave 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.319
 Here then is this 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.319
 I'll stay here until the next time I went
