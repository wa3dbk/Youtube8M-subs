 small house a door holder 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.390
 uh homemade the fact of creating a 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.550
 faction 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:41.480
 if you want to do it and blue that 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:45.160
 will expand on their section and mark fc 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:53.470
 normally it's marked in which 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.470
 so that's good 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.960
 after there will be the pvp rule so 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.680

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:13.100
 if you find you are roman and chf 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.040

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.920
 at home when you will have everything 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.220
 all done so here is the repeat I 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.820
 the green brand will have many more 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.030
 things but I do not have a word of spending 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.580
 we sometimes came back the desired adventures 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.390
 but not or other things 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.040
 our amd country four types he told me 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.770
 if you like not so big crappy 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.290
 so that in this radius you are 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:49.880
 pursued by someone and that my breasts 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:58.730
 do not finish and fall into trouble this is 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:01.760
 con for him himeur if now we 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.220
 that I call the pg think a little 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.520
 little what makes holes what 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:13.610
 someone who has a base a destructive 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:18.230
 that a country on it I do not have so much 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:21.800
 because you believe a share of two 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.760
 dangers too we were crying if 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.860
 I like to go get the better I get you 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.850
 advise as if traces 1 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.240
 when you get a clan you can 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.650
 kill 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:44.290
 ah yes there are also limits avoid 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.290
 so here I went around the cervin 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:57.630
 I also specify that you can go out 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.960
 anything here there is no 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.920
 of explosion then equality 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.260
 what I find it nil and who actually 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.660
 please there are clippers could 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:17.850
 study but they will not explode because 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:22.680
 than me for example if they should all 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.930
 protected from the pinball it would take a little 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.730
 of time to do it 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.100
 so I installed a pub they say 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.440
 ready for those who want it for 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:38.820
