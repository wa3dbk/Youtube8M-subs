00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
up and over so in slow motion

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.120 
up and over so in slow motion
you're<00:02:18.690> coming<00:02:18.930> behind<00:02:19.079> over<00:02:19.819> behind<00:02:20.819> over

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
over now in full speed let's go look

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.569 
over now in full speed let's go look

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
like this so you can use both ways both

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.880 
like this so you can use both ways both
will<00:02:32.849> warm<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.599> they're<00:02:34.530> both<00:02:34.560> really

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
will warm you up and they're both really

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.180 
will warm you up and they're both really
great<00:02:35.099> exercises

all<00:02:39.030> right<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> next<00:02:39.990> one<00:02:40.110> we're<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
all right so the next one we're going to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.870 
all right so the next one we're going to
do<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.590> side<00:02:40.830> shuffle<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.640> very

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
do is side shuffle and this is very

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880 
do is side shuffle and this is very
important<00:02:42.330> for<00:02:42.420> hockey<00:02:42.600> because<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.680> want<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
