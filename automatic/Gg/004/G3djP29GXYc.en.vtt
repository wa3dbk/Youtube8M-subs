00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 how friends of youtube greets you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.750
 again jorge mendoza are phrases of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.639
 be back here with you in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.000
 this time we are going to see in a very 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.330
 simple what are the position 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.890
 fundamental to playing the guitar 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.320
 first of all I want to tell you that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.539
 It is very important that you adopt 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 a comfortable position and obviously the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 correct position when touching the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.740
 guitar why why many 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.920
 Sometimes we can get used to touching 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.920
 by way of 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.380
 position a position that can us 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.960
 tired that we can go 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.780
 to cut too soon if you are 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.190
 someone who is starting with the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590
 instrument I recommend you to 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.960
 you start with the bases if those bases are 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.540
 precisely first how are we going to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.990
 place the help first thing is 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.720
 place us in a chair 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.900
 and we are going to place ourselves like this 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.730
 let's sit in the middle part 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.640
 of what is this 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.420
 the chair the players I go to the shore and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.939
 let's put it far behind 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.970
 but at a midpoint then 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:16.860
 let's open our legs 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 the skin your left leg will be 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 your right leg is going to be doing 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.189
 at the nape of 45 degrees 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 for whom to do 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.450
 comfortably pass 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.200
 in this way all to place seeks 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.890
 do not do this many times it happens that a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.010
 Sometimes this is touching 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.420
 and you are like that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.080
 try to have the position in this way 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.159
 you will love singh a line that goes by 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.319
 faithful 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.810
 and that is going to hit almost like they are your 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.509
 lips is an imaginary line that you 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.580
 You are going to draw and come to drink wine to your 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.230
 mouth 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.720
 and that way you're going to have a good 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.320
 reference so that to be able to move 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.550
 freely 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.840
 of the reason 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.910
 if you do not take care of this 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.350
 If I have almost the habit of doing 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.020
 this 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.200
 you're going to play very uncomfortable you're going to be very 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.280
 limited in movement very comfortable you 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.210
 you are going to tire very quickly then 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 the idea of keeping that angle like that 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.780
 is the correct way your right hand 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:38.709
 must be loose to be loose 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.550
 the previous part when posing the envelope more 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.550
 or less where is 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.440
 in this way 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.960
 then we review first it's about 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.020
 adequately 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.040
 run the feet 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.640
 the left 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.969
 the right foot in some to put your 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.270
 guitar you're going to take care that the angle of 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:11.630
 the imaginary line 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.880
 delay toward your mouth 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.940
 your right hand you are going to put the csa 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.840
 loose 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.319
 let's place 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.830
 and these are the first first steps 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.050
 to start playing that are the position 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
 basic to start playing meditate 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.120
