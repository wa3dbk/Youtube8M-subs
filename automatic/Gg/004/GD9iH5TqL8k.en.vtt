00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
being a catfish at first because it was

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.940 
being a catfish at first because it was
that<00:04:08.790> plotting<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.630> then<00:04:09.739> when<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.799> got

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
that plotting and then when I got

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.220 
that plotting and then when I got
obviously<00:04:11.069> down<00:04:11.489> into<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.569> reeds<00:04:12.780> down<00:04:13.049> he

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
obviously down into the reeds down he

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.930 
obviously down into the reeds down he
excites<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.769> Wade<00:04:14.069> out<00:04:14.099> for<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.549> as<00:04:14.639> could<00:04:14.790> see

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
excites a Wade out for it as could see

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.569 
excites a Wade out for it as could see
it<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> car<00:04:15.419> and<00:04:15.859> got<00:04:16.859> herself<00:04:16.979> tangled<00:04:17.489> in

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
it was a car and got herself tangled in

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.050 
it was a car and got herself tangled in
the<00:04:17.639> reeds

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the reeds

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.390 
the reeds
freed<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.109> from<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.799> then<00:04:19.950> plotted

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
freed it from that it then plotted

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.730 
freed it from that it then plotted
around<00:04:20.609> out<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:20.910> middle<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.450> which<00:04:21.599> time<00:04:22.590> I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
around out in the middle in which time I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.710 
around out in the middle in which time I
did<00:04:22.889> see<00:04:23.160> that<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.669> was<00:04:23.760> floppy<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.599> old

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
did see that it was floppy so the old

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.520 
did see that it was floppy so the old
lakes<00:04:24.930> went<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.200> jelly<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> little<00:04:25.710> bit<00:04:25.889> and

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
lakes went to jelly a little bit and

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.330 
lakes went to jelly a little bit and
basically<00:04:28.530> rolled<00:04:28.740> in<00:04:28.889> front<00:04:29.039> of<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.160> net<00:04:29.310> I

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
basically rolled in front of the net I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.310 
basically rolled in front of the net I
scooped<00:04:29.669> him<00:04:29.849> up<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.180> yeah<00:04:30.900> let's<00:04:31.169> have<00:04:31.260> a

straightforward<00:05:35.470> it's<00:05:35.920> no<00:05:36.100> different<00:05:36.460> to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
straightforward it's no different to

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.270 
straightforward it's no different to
what<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.000> always<00:05:37.210> use<00:05:37.660> I've<00:05:38.380> been<00:05:38.560> using<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:39.100> lot

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
what I always use I've been using a lot

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.550 
what I always use I've been using a lot
of<00:05:39.310> trigger<00:05:39.580> link<00:05:39.790> this<00:05:40.000> last<00:05:40.350> last<00:05:41.350> few

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
of trigger link this last last few

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.520 
of trigger link this last last few
months<00:05:41.890> but<00:05:42.390> I'd<00:05:43.390> wanted<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.750> get<00:05:43.960> cut<00:05:44.140> off<00:05:44.350> in

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
months but I'd wanted to get cut off in

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.110 
months but I'd wanted to get cut off in
this<00:05:44.650> way<00:05:44.830> because<00:05:45.040> he's<00:05:45.280> quite<00:05:45.490> razor<00:05:45.700> sharp

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
this way because he's quite razor sharp

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.220 
this way because he's quite razor sharp
is<00:05:46.300> obviously<00:05:46.540> a<00:05:46.600> few<00:05:46.690> muscles<00:05:47.110> that's

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
on here at the my winch but I've been

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.460 
on here at the my winch but I've been
using<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.550> 60<00:06:18.940> ml<00:06:19.150> square<00:06:19.360> pick<00:06:19.540> squid<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.320> then

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
using a 60 ml square pick squid and then

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.440 
using a 60 ml square pick squid and then
just<00:06:20.650> tipping<00:06:20.950> it<00:06:21.040> with<00:06:21.130> his<00:06:21.220> mutant<00:06:21.580> on<00:06:22.150> the

just tipping it with his mutant on the

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.550 
just tipping it with his mutant on the
end<00:06:22.570> and<00:06:22.750> basically<00:06:23.050> that's<00:06:23.260> it

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
end and basically that's it

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.470 
end and basically that's it
how's<00:06:23.680> the<00:06:23.800> presentation<00:06:24.460> kept<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.300> lot<00:06:25.420> of

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
how's the presentation kept a lot of

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.540 
how's the presentation kept a lot of

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
always need these complicated weeks and

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.749 
always need these complicated weeks and
setups<00:06:42.010> to<00:06:42.730> catch<00:06:42.880> these<00:06:43.060> big<00:06:43.270> uns
