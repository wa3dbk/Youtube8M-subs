00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
on top of the color trick just to give

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.240

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
it a little bit more of a pinky look

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.070 
it a little bit more of a pinky look
rather<00:04:25.550> than<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:26.000> gold<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.690> kind<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.930> helps

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
rather than a gold it just kind of helps

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.410 
rather than a gold it just kind of helps
balance<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.770> out<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.890> little<00:04:28.160> bit<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:29.150> really

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
balance it out a little bit and I really

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.270 
balance it out a little bit and I really
liked<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.840> way<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.290> turned<00:04:30.530> out

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280
