00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.959
 hello very good to all friends of upl 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 today, welcome one more day, I am going 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.860
 to teach a classic game case that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.929
 they are called in the allianz that many 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.490
 you will know and it is quite old for sure 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.370
 that some of you neither eveling has 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 been when this game came out this games 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.779
 has been attending since the first 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 consoles from the ceca of genes and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.679
 internal genes 64 play pce play 2 and has 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 gone adapting to all consoles 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.880
 up to android ios and it's because of this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.440
 why today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 the jan idea that in my opinion is a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
 game that is pretty cool is very 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.890
 entertaining and if you have played before 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 when I was a little younger you're going 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.660
 to bring back good memories nba jam se 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 characterized by being a very game 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.320
 simple with a few controls 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.090
 basic which makes it very 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.579
 Entertaining in attack and in defense 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.620
 we will have three basic controls and then 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
 we can combine them and make some 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 movements a little more advanced 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.370
 we hope it's very simple to play just 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 tim howard 5 minutes to adapt yet 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850
 so at the beginning you'll have a tutorial 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.549
 to learn 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.380
 and the most basic things in the nativity scene is 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.360
 a little bit like a game of 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.909
 street basketball of which all 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.619
 in which there is no good rule yes 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.810
 I think there's one when we launch and 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.570
 someone is putting the ball like this is already 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.970
 falling is considered not worth as 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.100
 it was an illegal stopper so it's worth 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.659
 basket I think that is the only rule that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.640
 there's no lack of liters 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.520
 free or anything what there are are some more 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.899
 specials when we go on a roll in 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.509
 our player will get with 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.270
 play over then it will make some 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.130
 awesome mates so if we want 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.130
 to win what we have to do is jump 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.050
 from another rival make the maximum supports 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.810
 possible and put all the letters that 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.030
 you can from each team we can 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.979
 select the players that we most 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.850
 like the most logical thing is to use a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.399
 base-guard and power forward or power forward 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.810
 have a fucking basketball idea 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.509
 let's say it one high and one low for 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.509
 have discovered the rebounds can 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.610
 make good mates and also have a 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.929
 Uncle of skill that manages the ball 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.180
 quickly 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.439
 we can play in multiplayer by 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.599
 wifi or bluetooth 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.790
 that yes in local mode we can not play in 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.799
 online mode if we had online this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.650
 game would veto him a lot more than he 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.629
 the petas we can play campaign mode 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.420
 which is kind of a league too 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.370
 we will be able to meet channel challenges 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.219
 and just like in almost all games 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.069
 sports such challenge 5 more 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:37.310
 followed in the allianz is a walker of 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.590
 payment is about 4 euros and something 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.150
 it's true that it's quite expensive it's good 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.859
 As you know, I've taught a lot 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.530
 way to download it for free 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.150

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.159
 you have a free alternative in 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.049
 iberia which is called jack city and from which 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.879
