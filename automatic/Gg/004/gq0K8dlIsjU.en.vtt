quite interesting you don't normally get

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.819 
quite interesting you don't normally get
this<00:03:44.030> bundled<00:03:45.030> with<00:03:45.150> mobile<00:03:45.569> phones<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:46.680> this

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
this bundled with mobile phones but this

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:54.979 
this bundled with mobile phones but this
is<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.069> little<00:03:47.400> dock<00:03:49.129> and<00:03:52.010> basically<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
is a little dock and basically on the

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.860 
is a little dock and basically on the
back<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.099> dog<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:56.669> I<00:03:56.849> just<00:03:57.180> look<00:03:57.419> through

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
back of the dog here I just look through

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.569 
back of the dog here I just look through
on<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.470> side<00:03:58.739> just<00:03:58.919> underneath<00:03:59.930> there's<00:04:00.930> two

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
on this side just underneath there's two

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.140 
on this side just underneath there's two
connections<00:04:02.579> here<00:04:02.939> so<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.959> can<00:04:04.169> be<00:04:04.199> used<00:04:04.590> for

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
connections here so this can be used for

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.879 
connections here so this can be used for
plugging<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.359> mains<00:04:06.629> power<00:04:07.109> adapter<00:04:07.650> here

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
plugging in a mains power adapter here

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.999 
plugging in a mains power adapter here
and<00:04:08.549> this<00:04:08.729> could<00:04:08.939> be<00:04:09.120> used<00:04:09.449> for<00:04:09.889> using<00:04:10.889> that

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:11.009 
and this could be used for using that

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.759 
and this could be used for using that
USB<00:04:11.370> cable<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> walls<00:04:13.199> message

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
USB cable so the walls message

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.589 
USB cable so the walls message
synchronized<00:04:14.400> your<00:04:14.669> desktop<00:04:15.090> when<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.389> plug

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
synchronized your desktop when you plug

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.219 
synchronized your desktop when you plug
in<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:17.070> then<00:04:17.310> on<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.849> top<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.750> unit

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
in and then on the top of this unit

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.680 
in and then on the top of this unit
we've<00:04:20.130> got<00:04:20.599> two<00:04:21.599> connectors<00:04:22.200> which<00:04:23.419> line<00:04:24.419> up

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
we've got two connectors which line up

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.920 
we've got two connectors which line up
this<00:04:24.990> one<00:04:25.260> here

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
this one here

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.749 
this one here
lines<00:04:26.350> up<00:04:26.590> with<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.770> phone<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.610> can

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
lines up with the phone so you can

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.900 
lines up with the phone so you can
actually<00:04:27.880> doc<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.539> phone<00:04:28.810> onto<00:04:29.590> this<00:04:29.979> desktop

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
actually doc the phone onto this desktop

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.180 
actually doc the phone onto this desktop
stand<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:32.229> you<00:04:32.320> could<00:04:32.410> use<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.620> perhaps<00:04:32.919> a

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
stand so you could use it perhaps a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.240 
stand so you could use it perhaps a
bedside<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.870> uses<00:04:35.259> that<00:04:35.380> landscape<00:04:36.009> portrait

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
bedside so uses that landscape portrait

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.960 
bedside so uses that landscape portrait
screen<00:04:36.940> also<00:04:37.380> displays<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.650> nice<00:04:38.919> angle<00:04:39.190> so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
screen also displays it a nice angle so

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.999 
screen also displays it a nice angle so
you<00:04:40.120> can<00:04:40.270> watch<00:04:40.419> your<00:04:40.570> media<00:04:40.930> back<00:04:41.139> and<00:04:41.440> then

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
you can watch your media back and then

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.279 
you can watch your media back and then
here<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.970> can<00:04:43.150> actually<00:04:43.539> charge<00:04:43.889> that
