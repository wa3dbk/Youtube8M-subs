 hello girls and real of the channel is captain 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.330
 and flowers and in today's video I'm 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.920
 super excited because I'm going to talk about 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 a brand that I liked makes 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.210
 long time but now finally 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 I know it's in Spain too, so I know 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.670
 It thrills me a lot and I'm talking 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.619
 of the products so if these 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 products 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.400
 these products are great and what 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 remarcarÃ­a takes apart that they work 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 super good is that they smell like you're dying 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.630
 so I'm super excited to have 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.940
 been reintroduced and contacted as well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 to test your products because the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 truth is that it has made me a lot 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 illusion and in today's video I bring a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.870
 good news and that is that we do not have to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.120
 give up the dryers to the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.160
 providers or the plates to be 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.780
 perfect one night just because we have 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 afraid that we will spoil the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.149
 hair and I'm going to teach a product 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.160
 that really is amazing you know that that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.219
 is my favorite word is a product 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.949
 that in just three minutes you have a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.049
 rehydration of your hair and that leaves you 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.590
 hair super soft and prepares you the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.149
 Hair also protects you 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.759
 for when you see use those 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.310
 heat tools on the iron 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.899
 curler to what you like more and seriously 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.390
 which for me it is one essential whenever 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.649
 I know I'm going to stylize my hair I'm going to 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.500
 use some of these tools 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.850
 heat is something I have to do because 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.189
 so he assured me that but he will be 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.049
 protected during the curling process of 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.780
 consider smoothing and nothing else I will 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.459
 teach my favorite hairstyle which is the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.759
 combed me as you can see I have the hair 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:38.950
 very long and I think it is very difficult to 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.530
 Sometimes styling the hair for pressures 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.439
 specials and what I usually do that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.119
 it's the first thing I like the most is curling 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.920
 me all the hair make me some very 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.289
 pretty in all the hair and after 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.939
 throwing all my hair on my side and it's very 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.500
 pretty and very elegant and I think it's 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.179
 perfect now yes again also a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.340
 little bit of cool hair next 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.349
 like it happened a lot to load so I 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.299
 I put everything on my side and then 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.250
 I have a little neck so that 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.409
 between the air and then the covers 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.729
 this side are so precious 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.530
 let's start with the video so that 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.539
 see the end 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.790
 and this is the star product of which 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.680
 I am so many serious that 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.350
 when you open it you will not be able to stop 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.240
 to literally put all the 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.400
 days at the end you are going to put the ones because 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.709
 if simply because google is great 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.600
 It also has a secret ingredient that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.700
 is the jojoba oil that will protect 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.130
 your hair from the irons of the dryers 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.290
 or the tongs and not only stay 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.989
 there will also do much more 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.850
 soft and shiny and I do not roll up anymore and 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.620
 let's go to the topic as you can see the only 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.870
 what I'm doing is winding each 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.390
 strand of hair around the curler to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.610
 for about 10 seconds and then 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.040
 subject the curl and when it cools a 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.840
 I let it fall and once 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.640
 I have all the curly hair I'm going to do 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.640
 a very exaggerated side line 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.010
 I'm going to take two forks and I'm going to 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.220
 secure all the hair in the part of 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.220
 behind 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.430
 in this way the hair is not going to 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.430
 move from your site all night 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.300
 Y 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.130
 it's the end as you can see 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.750
 very simple but I think it is 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.540
 elegant and very beautiful for an occasion 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.010
 special and I hope you liked it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.870
