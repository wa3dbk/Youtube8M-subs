break I x2 it's a very nice gun and it
looks<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.000> bit<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:16.170> Buffy<00:00:17.010> double<00:00:17.310> shot

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

looks a bit like the Buffy double shot
the<00:00:18.480> same<00:00:18.660> boat<00:00:18.810> neck<00:00:19.170> or<00:00:19.380> double<00:00:19.710> barrel<00:00:20.150> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
neighbor but it's got sidekick so you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.509

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
streamliners remove it doesn't really

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.770 
streamliners remove it doesn't really
work<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.320> i'm<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> show<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.570> shoot

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
work and i'm going to show you can shoot

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.130 
work and i'm going to show you can shoot
you<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:53.090> two<00:00:54.090> starts<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you a one or two starts and this is a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
you a one or two starts and this is a
lot<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:55.410> difficult<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> use<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.969> i<00:00:57.090> am

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
lot more difficult to use i think i am

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
lot more difficult to use i think i am
some<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> don't<00:00:57.870> fight<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.890> i'm

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
some of you don't fight right so i'm

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.889 
some of you don't fight right so i'm
going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.370> tuna<00:01:00.890> right<00:01:01.890> let's<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.280> two

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
going to do tuna right let's or two

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.480 
going to do tuna right let's or two
probably<00:01:03.899> can't<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.979> went<00:01:08.220> picking

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
probably can't do that and went picking

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
probably can't do that and went picking
up<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.880> there

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.830 

right<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.490> pocket<00:01:14.939> that's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
right so this is how you pocket that's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
right so this is how you pocket that's
two<00:01:16.079> neighbors<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.970> each

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
two neighbors one here and one here each

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.249 
two neighbors one here and one here each
side<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.470> push<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.079> comes

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
side you push it and then if it comes

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.190 
side you push it and then if it comes
out<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.649> so<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.310> pull<00:01:23.579> it<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> want

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
out of it so you pull it out so you want

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.260 
out of it so you pull it out so you want
to<00:01:25.289> pop<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:25.950> until<00:01:26.729> these<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:28.170> errors

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
to pop it down until these two errors

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
to pop it down until these two errors
meet<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.649> just<00:01:31.920> take<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.429> back

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
meet and then you can just take it back

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
meet and then you can just take it back
up<00:01:32.789> do<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:35.390> like<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.079> put<00:01:37.289> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
up do you have to like you just put in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.919 
up do you have to like you just put in
to<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:39.920> all<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.750> once

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
to that all right now and then once

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.130 
to that all right now and then once
you've<00:01:43.079> done<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.940> can<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.149> hold<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you've done that so you can just hold it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
you've done that so you can just hold it
back<00:01:46.289> now<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.190> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> shoot<00:01:47.580> one<00:01:47.940> dot<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
back now I'm going to shoot one dot and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.120 
back now I'm going to shoot one dot and
then<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.140> other<00:01:49.170> doll<00:01:53.179> yeah<00:01:54.179> I<00:01:54.860> don't<00:01:55.860> know

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
then the other doll yeah I don't know

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.179 
then the other doll yeah I don't know
why<00:01:56.459> but<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.439> seam<00:01:58.679> for<00:01:58.920> powerful

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
why but this this side seam for powerful

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.080 
why but this this side seam for powerful
don't<00:01:59.849> know<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.409> them<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:02.099> dozen<00:02:02.880> how<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
don't know one them it's dozen how to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
don't know one them it's dozen how to
 it<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.099> should<00:02:05.310> be

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
 it but I think that should be

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
 it but I think that should be
sticky<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.209> don't<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
sticky because you don't want it on a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.029 
sticky because you don't want it on a
gun<00:02:07.349> to<00:02:07.979> let<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.610> oh<00:02:10.039> it
