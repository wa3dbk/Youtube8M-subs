[Intro music]

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.469
[Intro music]

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.490
Assalaamu Alaikum and welcome to Titli's Busy
Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.660
I like celery and I like walnuts

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.340
and I like eating them together.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.340
But I did wonder what would happen if I fused
them together in a soup...

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.730
But I did wonder what would happen if I fused
them together in a soup...

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.599
For my Celery and Walnut Soup I've got

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.989
a head of celery that I've washed and chopped.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.570
There's about 500 g of celery here.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.540
2 chopped shallots.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.430
Some celery leaves that I've put to one just
to decorate the soup.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.549
50 g of walnuts.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.330
Either walnut halves or chopped walnuts.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.050
2 tablespoons of cream.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.160
Any cream and this is optional.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.190
But this isn't optional.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.260
It's a vegetable stock cube.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.220
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.440
Add in the shallots.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.460
Sauté them gently for a couple of minutes.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250
After two minutes,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.619
add in the celery and sauté this for a further
5 minutes.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.300
After 5 minutes of sautéing, add in 650 ml
of water.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.290
Crumble in the stock cube.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.440
Bring to the boil.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.190
When it comes to the boil, turn the heat down

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.110
and allow it to simmer for about 20 minutes.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.780
Meanwhile, in a small pan, far far away,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.100
I'll lightly toast these walnuts over a medium
heat.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.580
There's no oil in here.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.290
After 4 or 5 minutes, they should become quite
fragrant.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.170
We'll turn off the heat now.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.580
After 20 minutes, everything should be soft.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.619
I'll add in the walnuts.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.659
Stir them in.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.659
Turn off the heat

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.930
and allow to cool a little.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.250
When it's cooled a little, you can either
process it in a blender

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.300
or use a hand blender.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.300
or use a hand blender.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.300
Oh, I do love my whizzy toy!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.379
Just season it a little with a little salt.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.379
Just test.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.790
Just test.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.880
Oh, that is gorgeous!

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.590
Stir in the cream and serve immediately.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.180
Garnish with celery leaves and serve with
herby croutons.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.970
Well, mystery solved!

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.470
The fusion of celery plus walnuts in a soup
equals a delicious soup.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.630
Join me next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen
with me Titli Nihaan.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.450
Until next time...

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.980
