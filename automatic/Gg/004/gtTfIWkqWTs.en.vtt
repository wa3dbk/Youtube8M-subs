00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.250
 I was going there I do yourself is for you 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.070
 have we want to customize the kitchen 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 using paper contact contaction paper 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.360
 super versatile that I love to use in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.370
 my decorating projects for each 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.039
 including I already used to customize 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.750
 My neighborhood here at home I even made a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.270
 video in the center to you all the process 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920
 anyone who wants well just clicks 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.030
 in the wine video that will appear here 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.070
 french side 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 today others another one using 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.810
 contact paper and this time we are 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 customize a wall that this task 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 is that you're standing behind me 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 She would have told the counter here about my 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 kitchen and we wanted a bit of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.159
 color for her to leave everything more cheerful 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.180
 because the texts that we have that are 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.220
 very simple 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 so we wanted to do it and this one more 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.710
 spending very little and even thought about that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.869
 option of adhesives to hydraulic kisses 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 that we have already found contrast in 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.490
 some online stores you can also 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.560
 sending anyone or graphical knows just 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.400
 no more expensive than opting for the role 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.200
 contact is that we did not like it any more 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.720
 35 reais in the two papers for 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.790
 customize this stop here then 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.250
 I thought it was super cool result 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.420
 and come back to be cool because it's different from 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.399
 Wallpaper 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.000
 you can remove and then yes 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.910
 cause no damage to the wall 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.760
 does not take off does not draw ink so it 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.170
 It's cool because of this too and he's 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.180
 Cheap also you will find in any 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.430
 stationery that trophy you use 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.110
 still a school notebook and is a form 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.479
 super simple cheap bituca 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.580
 customizing the house does not only help 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.560
 How did you make this wall and one? 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.020
 Agent was super cute, I hope you guys 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.770
 also I took like a son to us 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.500
 I started and so rectangle g15 for 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.780
 15 centimeters on paper with late 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.970
 Is it cool that you ask for your wall? 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.520
 a place where you want to put the bank 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 make an estimate of how much 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.630
 the comics you will need the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.360
 What size do you want for this here? 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.820
 had 30 by 30 tiles in these people 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.550
 I wanted very big so I opted for 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.590
 making 15 by 15 comics is cool 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.360
 here on the back of the contact paper already has 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.670
 some measurement markings then 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.410
 much easier to cut before you 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 put on the legal wall also pass 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.209
 cookie a target to remove some 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.400
 subject that may have because sg line 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.560
 will stay in the canopy area it will not 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.290
 make marriage so cool it can 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.810
 end up taking off more easily 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.390
 so do the cast some tests and cap 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.190
 and before you paste or ask that in the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.530
 Wall is cool you also get a 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.720
 sponge as a descent and put a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.910
 little detergent to pass before 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.040
 paste the paper because there he is there 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.049
 time you put your foot on the wall 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.230
 He is also a member of the church. 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.519
 you will be able to touch it arises 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.730
 some one ball or the world and radar 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.920
 to make it easier to adjust 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.360
 It's better then, it's much easier to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.970
 paste this is a tip I give to 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.910
 You and I already command and I've been 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.670
 plain paper like never red with 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.280
 flowery embossed paper will have a lot of you 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.500
 You liked it and it's super cool. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.200
 idea also because when you tire 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.410
 just do it differently with 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.290
 other things yet 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.360
 I wanted to say to you, I very much hope that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.830
 did you like the video you have 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.500
 I enjoyed today's debt to 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.450
 personalize each plague by the house and 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.250
 This is the channel's goal. 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.590
