00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.970
 well big hello to everyone today 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 video is absolutely not about cosmetics 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.920
 and know about these favorites that I 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 I have been using for a very long time 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.359
 several months without changing it such 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.470
 a tavern in everyday things not perfect 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 a different plan and I just decided why 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.269
 would not share with you maybe you 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 you will underline something first 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 I'm such a wonderful player from the company 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.450
 sony with whom I go to the pool do not know 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.670
 how do you know when you swim in the pool 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 so and if he is also 25 meters my 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.930
 the look is always fixed on the clock then 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 have you set let's say that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.309
 you want to swim there for half an hour and you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.070
 swim and watch your watch all the time 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 when does this end want you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.079
 swims and of course like new 25 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.079
 meters they like that there minute 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 passes and swam pool minute minutes 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.660
 before husband god how much I still swim a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.040
 with a player completely brain turns off 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.590
 The player is very good by the way. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 He has been working for about two years 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.820
 without interruption does not numb 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.920
 that is, it is a super thing and you canâ€™t 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
 Only in the pool to swim in the same course 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.820
 and in lakes in rivers in the seas wherever 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.659
 there is a great thing and not moving away from 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.159
 water all our elements I want 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.509
 to say that I really like to use 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.210
 rezino here invisible bubble bubble 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.909
 wait invisible dough I have a lot of them 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.820
 different variations 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.070
 exactly i like to use when hair 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 get wet or are you going on vacation always 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.290
 convenient to quickly tie the tail and then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.149
 when hair gets wet easier to take off than 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.159
 ordinary gum usually gum pulls a 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.170
 this and straighten and well, like that less 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.210
 hurt but I know I can't say 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.990
 that this is a super miracle thing of some kind 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 unreal 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.009
 and that hair does not spoil at all if 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.140
 make here such a low tail like u 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.810
 me even now hall and all the same 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.360
 Well, maybe they will stay a little but not 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.000
 I know 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.570
 a little bit probably the same room and not 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.340
 I see nothing straight wah wah how about 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.600
 tells them but you still feel 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.680
 if wet head 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.420
 then remove the gum from the hair much like 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.050
 would be nicer and not tear me personally 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.150
 satisfied they anyone for what they have favorite 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.190
 we have summer in the yard so I bought 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.480
 sequins ballet flats 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.520
 I just could not stand it pouring 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.910
 Likely business 2 already rain nonstop 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.310
 such a problem but very strong and 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.800
 I got dinner completely and that's why I 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.890
 went bought a rubber ballet shoes 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.900
 it's just a mega thing honestly they are very 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.870
 conveniently they have absolutely good 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.720
 a normal insole never rubs anything 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.350
 although it seems rubber yes such here but I 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 very pleased and that I puddle that I do not 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.780
 puddles now I go here with such ballet glasses 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.200
 or my summer is going well my 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.370
 fourth favorite is such here 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.269
 breads from the corner they are completely different 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:24.630
 variations i listen here this thing i eat i 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:27.010
 it seems to me to be honest all the time 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.680
 I am always very skeptical 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.230
 belonged to 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.239
 just such a plan for an air loaf 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.450
 because they are all the same rubber 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.480
 tasteless well yes there are fewer calories 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.209
 less in them there any rubbish here they are 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.090
 Here are painted that they are here without gluten 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.940
 such are all good but they are all tasteless 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.570
 and you blow well what to bother with your mouth 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.299
 damn it damn it and these breads and how 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.239
 then decided to try and listen honestly 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.920
 I say it so goodness that is, if 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.200
 you take this one from me 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:09.310
 rice 7 cereals and some sweet you beat 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.620
 at least the usual here this ridge she put 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.440
 top there avocados I don't know tomato or 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.560
 something else it just turns out delicious 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.860
 delicious snow but without any 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:26.169
 This is terrible, but because I usually took 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.680
 they boneless took the usual loaves here 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.090
 thin rye well and not worse of course 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.220
 taste tastes better but worse yes and these foods are from 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.750
 delight separately I want to highlight 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.900
 cranberry breads because it's straight 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.600
 this is my dessert loaves and yes even sweet 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.500
 and they are so delicious you take a cup of tea 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.630
 you take one ridge you don't mess 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.940
 nothing on him you put it on 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.300
 Itself is very tasty here it is written that he 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.830
 sugar free fiber here whole grains 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.180
 it's just incredibly tasty and what else 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.520
 I like these faces 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.729
 clips they are such fraud for me 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.130
 personally for my brain because myself 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.790
 the ridge is big enough to one 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.280
 little thing are you taking it and fat big and 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.370
 you take so much from two things 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.289
 and that's all the two schemes will not any longer and 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.860
 when you take some ridge again 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.050
 finquist 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.020
 for example he is a thin money for gone from 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.210
 I'll take 4 myself there 5 I'll eat 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.970
 and these are you taking Nepal plates already 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.100
 occupy though not air such 10 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.440
 nothing in themselves is very necessary 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.550
 look at read worth 130 rubles 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.979
 tutu nobody go broke and it's very 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.680
 delicious sandwiches for tomorrow there just 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.680
 to myself somewhere in the bite who likes how 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.650
 variations in a million but this very thing ca. 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.060
 what you need and the last fifth favorite 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.919
 he is no longer as interesting as everyone 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.810
 the rest is thermal water without 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.620
 which I basically don't do too 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.060
 always carry with me just refresh my face 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.130
 when we are in the mall 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.900
 somewhere walked you feel something like that 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.450
 I would like to wash my face 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.910
 do something always-always on me with 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.600
 a large amount because summer 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:21.220
 I poured it on myself very, very 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.900
 scale thats all it was my favorite 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.370
 I hope that you have emphasized for yourself 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.830
 some kind of zest can you something 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.830
 pushed many thanks and bye
