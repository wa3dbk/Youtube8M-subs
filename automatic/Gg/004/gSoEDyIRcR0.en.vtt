00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
yeah nice so let's just make this target

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.390 
yeah nice so let's just make this target
bigger<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.799> really<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.040> doesn't<00:01:26.189> really

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
bigger and really it doesn't really

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.980 
bigger and really it doesn't really
matter<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> put<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:29.450> feet<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.720> the

track in point PES overall it's just the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.600 
track in point PES overall it's just the
pieces<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.799> gonna<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:35.040> flying<00:01:35.280> everywhere

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
pieces are gonna be flying everywhere

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910 
pieces are gonna be flying everywhere
it's<00:01:35.820> gonna<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.060> sick<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> let's<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.680> make<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's gonna be sick so let's just make it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.660 
it's gonna be sick so let's just make it
right<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.159> hold<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.310> command

right here for now and hold down command

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.180 
right here for now and hold down command
or<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.060> mac

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
those points right there and then you're

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.690 
those points right there and then you're
going<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.590> click<00:01:51.650> down<00:01:51.980> here<00:01:52.010> in<00:01:52.310> Korea<00:01:52.580> camera

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
going to click down here in Korea camera

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.330 
going to click down here in Korea camera
and<00:01:55.990> then<00:01:56.990> once<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.410> cameras<00:01:57.770> made<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.160> want

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
and then once the cameras made you want

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.840 
and then once the cameras made you want
to<00:01:58.430> go<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.580> layer<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.240> make<00:01:59.870> a<00:01:59.900> new<00:02:00.200> solid<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
to go to layer and make a new solid the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.930 
to go to layer and make a new solid the
same<00:02:02.090> size<00:02:02.480> as<00:02:02.930> your<00:02:03.320> composition<00:02:04.220> mines<00:02:04.400> 1280

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
same size as your composition mines 1280

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.219 
same size as your composition mines 1280
by<00:02:05.060> 720<00:02:05.800> should<00:02:06.800> be<00:02:06.920> yours<00:02:07.100> too<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:08.229> then

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
by 720 should be yours too and then

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.260 
by 720 should be yours too and then
you're<00:02:09.410> going<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.710> need<00:02:09.920> um<00:02:10.250> element<00:02:11.090> 3d

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
you're going to be need um element 3d

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.960 
you're going to be need um element 3d
for<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.160> probably<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.640> us<00:02:13.760> some

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
for this you can probably get us some

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.260 
for this you can probably get us some
why<00:02:14.920> videocopilot<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:18.880> make<00:02:19.880> sure<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.060> the

why videocopilot and make sure that the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.580 
why videocopilot and make sure that the
load<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.610> then<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:24.080> want<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.290> go<00:02:24.410> down<00:02:24.560> a

floor fracture right here now you want

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.810 
floor fracture right here now you want
to<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.050> presets<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.800> really<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.730> up

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you just have this block it here but

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.240 
you just have this block it here but
thumb<00:03:01.640> then<00:03:02.600> go<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.290> group<00:03:04.239> particle<00:03:05.239> look

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
thumb then go to group particle look

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.370 
thumb then go to group particle look
rotation<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.140> then

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
rotation and then

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.490 
rotation and then
um<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:12.120> want<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.330> go<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> multi-object<00:03:12.990> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
um you want to go to multi-object and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.910 
um you want to go to multi-object and
enable<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:16.070> then<00:03:17.900> there's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.960> lot<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.140> XY

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
enable that and then there's a lot of XY

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.340 
enable that and then there's a lot of XY
and<00:03:20.250> Z's<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:21.480> I'm<00:03:21.750> pretty<00:03:21.900> sure<00:03:21.990> it's<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
and Z's and I'm pretty sure it's the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.030 
and Z's and I'm pretty sure it's the
second<00:03:22.890> one<00:03:22.950> down<00:03:23.600> right<00:03:24.600> here<00:03:24.810> yeah<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.380> just
