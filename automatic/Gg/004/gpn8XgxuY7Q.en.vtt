00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.550 
I guess golden times in a Silver Arrow

go-kart track I arrived at the airport
and<00:02:52.880> who<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.870> see<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.440> was<00:02:54.590> Nico<00:02:54.890> waiting<00:02:55.310> for<00:02:55.490> a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
and who I see it was Nico waiting for a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.760 
and who I see it was Nico waiting for a
taxi<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.270> we<00:02:56.390> put<00:02:56.540> him<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.750> our<00:02:56.870> car<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.200> go

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
taxi so we put him in our car and go

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.100 
taxi so we put him in our car and go
together<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.520> racetrack<00:02:58.760> at<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.900> time

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
together to the racetrack at this time

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.140 
together to the racetrack at this time
we<00:03:00.290> didn't<00:03:00.530> know<00:03:00.650> there<00:03:00.890> was<00:03:01.010> actually<00:03:01.910> a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
we didn't know there was actually a

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.310 
we didn't know there was actually a
possible<00:03:03.070> joining<00:03:04.070> with<00:03:04.580> each<00:03:04.760> other<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.320> I

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
possible joining with each other and I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.200 
possible joining with each other and I
think<00:03:06.350> he's<00:03:06.920> highly<00:03:07.130> competitive<00:03:07.670> he's<00:03:08.120> very

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
think he's highly competitive he's very

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.380 
think he's highly competitive he's very
fast<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.200> proven<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.710> many<00:03:10.310> times<00:03:10.550> but<00:03:11.270> at

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
fast it's proven this many times but at

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.550 
fast it's proven this many times but at
the<00:03:11.420> same<00:03:11.630> time<00:03:11.810> that's<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.080> big<00:03:12.230> challenge<00:03:12.380> for

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
the same time that's a big challenge for

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.770 
the same time that's a big challenge for
me
