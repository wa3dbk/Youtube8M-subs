00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
have for years and some of the questions

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.640 
have for years and some of the questions
come<00:00:07.819> to<00:00:07.849> me<00:00:08.240> is<00:00:08.450> what<00:00:08.990> board<00:00:09.230> is<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:09.500> right

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
come to me is what board is the right

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.180 
come to me is what board is the right
board<00:00:09.920> for<00:00:10.190> me<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:10.549> you'll<00:00:11.360> find<00:00:11.389> that<00:00:12.070> one<00:00:13.070> of

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
board for me and you'll find that one of

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.070 
board for me and you'll find that one of
the<00:00:13.280> key<00:00:13.549> things<00:00:13.969> about<00:00:14.209> picking<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:14.929> right

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
the key things about picking the right

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.339 
the key things about picking the right
board<00:00:15.530> is<00:00:15.799> about<00:00:16.340> knowing<00:00:16.730> what<00:00:17.630> part<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.080> your

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
board is about knowing what part of your

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.599 
board is about knowing what part of your
quiver<00:00:18.619> you're<00:00:19.250> really<00:00:19.820> trying<00:00:20.449> to<00:00:20.689> fill<00:00:20.960> and

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
quiver you're really trying to fill and

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.999 
quiver you're really trying to fill and
you<00:00:22.609> know<00:00:22.730> where<00:00:22.939> you<00:00:23.090> live

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
you know where you live

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.189 
you know where you live
your<00:00:25.009> environment<00:00:25.670> really<00:00:26.210> has<00:00:26.420> a<00:00:26.449> lot<00:00:26.599> to<00:00:27.019> do

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
your environment really has a lot to do

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.259 
your environment really has a lot to do
with<00:00:27.230> what<00:00:27.740> board<00:00:28.039> works<00:00:28.339> there<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.880> what<00:00:29.119> one

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
with what board works there and what one

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.240 
with what board works there and what one
doesn't<00:00:29.539> many<00:00:30.289> times<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.830> know<00:00:30.949> I'll<00:00:31.099> watch

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
doesn't many times you know I'll watch

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.600 
doesn't many times you know I'll watch
kids<00:00:31.609> that<00:00:31.939> are<00:00:32.320> about<00:00:33.320> picking<00:00:34.070> boards<00:00:34.430> that

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
kids that are about picking boards that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.210 
kids that are about picking boards that
say<00:00:35.030> their<00:00:35.240> favorite<00:00:35.600> surfer<00:00:35.960> rides<00:00:36.170> but<00:00:37.130> they

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
say their favorite surfer rides but they

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.650 
say their favorite surfer rides but they
ride<00:00:37.430> in<00:00:37.580> a<00:00:37.700> different<00:00:37.970> location<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:38.570> their

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
ride in a different location and their

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.120 
ride in a different location and their
style<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.050> surfing<00:00:39.290> is<00:00:39.500> completely<00:00:39.950> different

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
style of surfing is completely different

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.430 
style of surfing is completely different
it<00:00:40.790> may<00:00:40.970> not<00:00:41.150> be<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.480> right<00:00:41.630> board<00:00:41.990> since<00:00:42.260> I've

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
it may not be the right board since I've

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.110 
it may not be the right board since I've
coached<00:00:42.650> with<00:00:42.830> the<00:00:42.950> US<00:00:43.160> team<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.700> coach<00:00:43.880> with

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
coached with the US team and coach with

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.790 
coached with the US team and coach with
some<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.450> best<00:00:44.630> athletes<00:00:44.840> I'll<00:00:45.410> really

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
some of the best athletes I'll really

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.190 
some of the best athletes I'll really
see<00:00:46.130> performance<00:00:46.790> differences<00:00:47.300> in<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.990> same

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
see performance differences in the same

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.170 
see performance differences in the same
surfer<00:00:48.680> from<00:00:48.950> one<00:00:49.190> style<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.700> board<00:00:49.940> to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
surfer from one style of a board to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.300 
surfer from one style of a board to
another<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.080> one<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.590> key<00:00:51.770> things<00:00:52.070> is

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
another so one of the key things is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.760 
another so one of the key things is
understanding<00:00:52.880> what<00:00:53.330> board<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:54.230> really

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
understanding what board that you really

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.980 
understanding what board that you really
want<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.220> fill<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:55.820> your<00:00:55.940> quiver<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.510> so

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
want to fill in your quiver and so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.380 
want to fill in your quiver and so
whether<00:00:57.200> it's<00:00:57.410> for<00:00:57.710> small<00:00:57.890> waves<00:00:58.340> or<00:00:58.640> burglary

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
whether it's for small waves or burglary

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.840 
whether it's for small waves or burglary
waves<00:00:59.690> at<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.170> location<00:01:00.800> whether<00:01:01.400> it's<00:01:01.640> kind

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
waves at that location whether it's kind

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.149 
waves at that location whether it's kind
of<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.030> way<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.300> this<00:01:02.390> like<00:01:02.630> pitch<00:01:02.960> tapu<00:01:03.410> or<00:01:03.710> if

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
of a way of this like pitch tapu or if

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.359 
of a way of this like pitch tapu or if
it's<00:01:04.369> punchy<00:01:04.820> beach<00:01:05.000> break<00:01:05.299> those<00:01:06.039> curves<00:01:07.039> on

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
it's punchy beach break those curves on

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.969 
it's punchy beach break those curves on
the<00:01:07.939> board<00:01:08.179> really<00:01:08.509> have<00:01:08.899> a<00:01:08.929> profound<00:01:09.500> effect

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
the board really have a profound effect

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.819 
the board really have a profound effect
on<00:01:10.130> how<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:10.759> works<00:01:10.969> in<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.570> kind<00:01:11.840> of<00:01:12.020> surf<00:01:12.259> so

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
on how it works in that kind of surf so

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.830 
on how it works in that kind of surf so
you<00:01:13.189> know<00:01:13.310> if<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.850> get<00:01:13.969> into<00:01:14.240> fishy<00:01:14.479> boards

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
you know if you get into fishy boards

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.349 
you know if you get into fishy boards
right<00:01:15.369> fishy<00:01:16.369> boards<00:01:16.729> are<00:01:16.850> boards<00:01:17.210> that

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
right fishy boards are boards that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.359 
right fishy boards are boards that
generate<00:01:17.810> their<00:01:17.990> own<00:01:18.020> speed<00:01:18.469> by<00:01:18.649> surface<00:01:19.189> area

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
generate their own speed by surface area

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.940 
generate their own speed by surface area
fishy<00:01:20.060> boards<00:01:20.539> are<00:01:20.659> well-loved<00:01:21.499> because<00:01:21.920> a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
fishy boards are well-loved because a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.739 
fishy boards are well-loved because a
lot<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.549> people<00:01:22.820> can<00:01:23.030> ride<00:01:23.270> them<00:01:23.450> they<00:01:23.630> don't

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
lot of people can ride them they don't

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.749 
lot of people can ride them they don't
take<00:01:24.020> as<00:01:24.170> much<00:01:24.380> as<00:01:24.560> athleticism<00:01:25.159> as<00:01:25.609> the

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
take as much as athleticism as the

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.609 
take as much as athleticism as the
high-performance<00:01:26.450> boards<00:01:26.749> to<00:01:27.200> make<00:01:27.229> them

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
high-performance boards to make them

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.770 
high-performance boards to make them
work<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.070> one<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.609> the<00:01:28.729> key<00:01:28.939> things<00:01:29.240> about<00:01:29.390> a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
work and one of the key things about a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.559 
work and one of the key things about a
fishy<00:01:30.350> style<00:01:30.740> board<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.189> surface<00:01:31.670> area<00:01:31.999> so

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
fishy style board is surface area so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.080 
fishy style board is surface area so
you're<00:01:32.780> gonna<00:01:32.929> find<00:01:33.289> if<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.799> chase<00:01:34.789> down<00:01:34.819> a

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
you're gonna find if you chase down a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.169 
you're gonna find if you chase down a
fishy<00:01:35.479> board<00:01:35.869> do<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.649> want<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:37.069> true<00:01:37.429> fish<00:01:37.759> like

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
fishy board do you want a true fish like

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.620 
fishy board do you want a true fish like
this<00:01:38.450> board<00:01:38.780> right<00:01:39.020> here<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.479> know<00:01:41.600> a

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
this board right here that is you know a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.109 
this board right here that is you know a
typical<00:01:42.140> fish<00:01:42.409> or<00:01:43.039> do<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.399> want<00:01:43.640> more<00:01:43.939> of<00:01:43.969> a

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
typical fish or do you want more of a

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.649 
typical fish or do you want more of a
hybrid<00:01:44.359> like<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.740> or<00:01:46.399> even<00:01:46.819> up<00:01:46.999> board<00:01:47.329> more

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
hybrid like this or even up board more

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.020 
hybrid like this or even up board more
like<00:01:47.929> this<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:48.799> you'll<00:01:48.979> find<00:01:49.249> in<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.609> outline

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
like this so you'll find in the outline

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.230 
like this so you'll find in the outline
outlines<00:01:50.869> dictate<00:01:51.619> how<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.189> board<00:01:52.520> rides<00:01:52.850> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
outlines dictate how a board rides and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.510 
outlines dictate how a board rides and
say<00:01:53.869> for<00:01:54.049> instance<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.679> board<00:01:54.950> being<00:01:55.219> narrow

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
say for instance this board being narrow

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.309 
say for instance this board being narrow
you're<00:01:55.999> going<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.179> find<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.569> narrow<00:01:56.990> nose

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
you're going to find that narrow nose

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.219 
you're going to find that narrow nose
boards<00:01:57.829> climb<00:01:58.520> faces<00:01:59.179> in<00:01:59.359> fit<00:01:59.569> and<00:01:59.719> pockets

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
boards climb faces in fit and pockets

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.099 
boards climb faces in fit and pockets
easier<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.789> especially<00:02:02.329> as<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.719> pull<00:02:02.929> on<00:02:03.020> the

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
easier and especially as you pull on the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.649 
easier and especially as you pull on the
tail<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.499> fits<00:02:03.799> in<00:02:04.009> curvatures<00:02:04.700> better<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.329> is

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
tail it fits in curvatures better and is

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.020 
tail it fits in curvatures better and is
it<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:06.020> bit<00:02:06.259> more<00:02:06.469> for<00:02:06.740> high<00:02:06.859> performance

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
it a bit more for high performance

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.999 
it a bit more for high performance
whereas<00:02:08.030> when<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.450> get<00:02:08.600> into<00:02:08.899> wider<00:02:09.200> outlines

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
whereas when you get into wider outlines

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.680 
whereas when you get into wider outlines
you're<00:02:10.280> going<00:02:10.400> to<00:02:10.460> find<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:10.910> surface<00:02:11.510> area

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
you're going to find that surface area

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.890 
you're going to find that surface area
not<00:02:12.650> only<00:02:12.890> helps<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> generate<00:02:13.640> speed<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.780> it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
not only helps to generate speed but it

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.610 
not only helps to generate speed but it
harness

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
harness

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.360 
harness
and<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:16.220> actually<00:02:17.120> prolongs<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.110> speed<00:02:18.409> in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and can actually prolongs the speed in

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.920 
and can actually prolongs the speed in
the<00:02:19.760> bore<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.180> when<00:02:20.330> you've<00:02:20.450> got<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.599> tail

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the bore so when you've got a tail

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.660 
the bore so when you've got a tail
that's<00:02:21.170> really<00:02:21.560> wide<00:02:21.799> you're<00:02:22.280> gonna<00:02:22.400> find

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
that's really wide you're gonna find

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.070 
that's really wide you're gonna find
that<00:02:22.790> when<00:02:22.909> you<00:02:23.000> go<00:02:23.150> out<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.420> flats<00:02:23.810> it

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that when you go out on the flats it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.970 
that when you go out on the flats it
carries<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> lot<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.519> speed<00:02:26.269> right<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.440> what<00:02:27.739> is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
carries a lot of speed right but what is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.410 
carries a lot of speed right but what is
different<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.519> this<00:02:28.700> particular<00:02:29.060> board

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
different in this particular board

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.470 
different in this particular board
that's<00:02:29.690> wide<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:31.159> word<00:02:31.430> that's<00:02:31.849> wide<00:02:32.209> is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
that's wide and that word that's wide is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.930 
that's wide and that word that's wide is
really<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.200> tail<00:02:33.440> shape<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.010> you'll<00:02:34.610> find

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
really the tail shape and you'll find

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.240 
really the tail shape and you'll find
that<00:02:35.090> when<00:02:35.930> when<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.349> have<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.560> Swallowtail

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
that when when you have a Swallowtail

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.910 
that when when you have a Swallowtail
and<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> wide<00:02:37.940> tail<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.780> surfs<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.470> different<00:02:39.799> way

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
and a wide tail it surfs a different way

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.680 
and a wide tail it surfs a different way
than<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.370> board<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.849> has<00:02:41.030> curved<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.599> when

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
than a board that has curved and when

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.380 
than a board that has curved and when
you<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:41.930> curved<00:02:42.290> again<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.340> sends<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> board

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
you have curved again it sends the board

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.240 
you have curved again it sends the board
in<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.659> different<00:02:44.989> art<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.799> can<00:02:46.069> actually

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
in a different art so you can actually

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.640 
in a different art so you can actually
arc<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.940> board<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.420> curve<00:02:47.750> where<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.410> this

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
arc the board in a curve where as this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.009 
arc the board in a curve where as this
board<00:02:48.950> tends<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.549> be<00:02:49.670> really<00:02:50.150> projectile<00:02:50.840> in

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
board tends to be really projectile in

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.500 
board tends to be really projectile in
all<00:02:51.650> fishes<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.579> straight<00:02:53.000> angles

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
all fishes that have straight angles

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.420 
all fishes that have straight angles
especially<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.230> with<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.410> lot<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.890> lot<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.190> width

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
especially it with a lot a lot of width

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.580 
especially it with a lot a lot of width
you'll<00:02:56.060> find<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.569> board<00:02:56.810> really<00:02:57.349> runs

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
you'll find that that board really runs

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.949 
you'll find that that board really runs
fast<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.190> runs<00:02:58.400> laterally<00:02:59.060> more<00:02:59.540> than<00:02:59.780> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
fast and runs laterally more than this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.020 
fast and runs laterally more than this
board<00:03:00.290> does<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.980> picking<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.459> board<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.849> really

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
board does so picking a board is really

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.360 
board does so picking a board is really
breaking<00:03:02.450> down<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:03.019> board<00:03:03.260> within<00:03:04.099> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
breaking down the board within a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.420 
breaking down the board within a
category<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:05.150> deciding<00:03:06.140> what<00:03:06.470> fits<00:03:06.920> your

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
category and deciding what fits your

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.269 
category and deciding what fits your
style<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:08.060> surfing
