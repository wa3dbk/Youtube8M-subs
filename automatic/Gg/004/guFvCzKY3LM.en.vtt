00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
theory that my friend came up with why

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.979 
theory that my friend came up with why
the<00:00:35.820> world's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.300> gonna<00:00:36.420> end<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.719> throat

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the world's not gonna end on throat

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.600 
the world's not gonna end on throat
first<00:00:37.140> December<00:00:37.410> tomorrow<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
first December tomorrow and and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
first December tomorrow and and
basically<00:00:38.850> haste<00:00:39.360> clearly<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.809> there's<00:00:40.170> 25

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
basically haste clearly was there's 25

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.580 
basically haste clearly was there's 25
in<00:00:41.070> between<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.450> zones<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
in between the time zones I'm like the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
in between the time zones I'm like the
longest<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.910> surest<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.100> there<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.280> 25

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
longest and the surest and there is 25

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
longest and the surest and there is 25
hours<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.329> means<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.840> impossible<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
hours which means it is impossible for

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.470 
hours which means it is impossible for
everybody<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> world<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.120> 21st

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
December at one point which means

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.260 
December at one point which means
obviously<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> world<00:00:53.579> can't<00:00:53.760> end<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.059> Twitter

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

the new one
and<00:02:13.620> which<00:02:14.070> started<00:02:14.400> obviously<00:02:14.820> start<00:02:15.030> the

and which started obviously start the
calendar<00:02:15.330> again<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.340> probably<00:02:17.550> confuses

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
calendar again now you probably confuses

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.330 
calendar again now you probably confuses
to<00:02:18.390> what<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.690> hell<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:19.110> back<00:02:19.260> tuna<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
to what the hell are back tuna is and I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.710 
to what the hell are back tuna is and I
explained<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:21.030> back<00:02:21.210> 2nite<00:02:21.450> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
explained just now what back 2nite a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.170 
explained just now what back 2nite a
back<00:02:22.170> tuna<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> there<00:02:23.190> sort<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.460> measurement

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
back tuna is there sort of measurement

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.800 
back tuna is there sort of measurement
and<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:25.800> kind<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.670> time<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.210> now<00:02:27.570> back<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and of kind of time and now back to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.870 
and of kind of time and now back to
North<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.350> us<00:02:28.500> would<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:30.230> 1000<00:02:31.730> 144,000<00:02:32.730> da

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
North to us would be a 1000 144,000 da

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.930 
North to us would be a 1000 144,000 da
days<00:02:33.750> which<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.160> roughly<00:02:35.160> around<00:02:35.370> three

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
days which is roughly around three

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.580 
days which is roughly around three
hundred<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.390> eighty<00:02:36.630> four<00:02:36.930> years<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
hundred and eighty four years and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.580 
hundred and eighty four years and
roughly<00:02:38.580> give<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> cake<00:02:39.030> maybe<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.780> couple

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
roughly give a cake maybe a couple

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.410 
roughly give a cake maybe a couple
months<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.730> add<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:42.000> lot<00:02:42.209> it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
months and so you add that a lot it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.479 
months and so you add that a lot it
comes<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:44.780> 5124<00:02:45.780> years<00:02:46.230> roughly<00:02:47.130> again

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
comes to 5124 years roughly again

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.890 
comes to 5124 years roughly again
obviously<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.510> come<00:02:48.690> with<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
obviously because it's come with the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.330 
obviously because it's come with the
rough<00:02:49.020> calculations<00:02:49.610> now<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.959> calendar<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
rough calculations now this calendar to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.479 
rough calculations now this calendar to
them<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:54.050> ends<00:02:55.050> tomorrow<00:02:55.530> as<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.130> 13th

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
I guess and and the stars they've got a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.570 
I guess and and the stars they've got a
lot<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.680> because<00:03:38.010> there's<00:03:38.310> loads<00:03:38.489> of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
lot of it is because there's loads of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.060 
lot of it is because there's loads of
people<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:39.180> recently<00:03:39.810> joined<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.860> mine

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
people have recently joined the mine

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.460 
people have recently joined the mine
like<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.060> way<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.299> life<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.780> culture<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
like the way of life the culture the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.440 
like the way of life the culture the
religion<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.280> take<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.910> up<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.239> hope

that<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:46.320> will<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.590> saved<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.640> think<00:03:47.850> it's

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
that they will be saved and I think it's

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.810 
that they will be saved and I think it's
all<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> lot<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> bullshit<00:03:49.500> basically<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.220> not
