that's<00:00:19.560> whatever<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.760> beginning

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that's whatever it was in the beginning

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.439 
that's whatever it was in the beginning
of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> build<00:00:21.390> anyway<00:00:23.029> as<00:00:24.029> far<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of the build anyway as far as the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509 
of the build anyway as far as the
customisation<00:00:25.109> goes<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.710> thing<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.160> think

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
customisation goes on this thing I think

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
customisation goes on this thing I think
I'm<00:00:26.670> gonna<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.420> basic<00:00:27.720> bumper<00:00:28.019> bar<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I'm gonna do the basic bumper bar in the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.950 
I'm gonna do the basic bumper bar in the
back<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.820> basic<00:00:30.300> bumper<00:00:30.599> bar<00:00:30.750> with

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
lights up front and for some reason the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
lights up front and for some reason the
extra<00:00:34.890> fog<00:00:35.100> lights<00:00:35.370> they<00:00:35.579> add<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.030> car

just don't work for some reason which
hopefully<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> gets<00:00:44.700> fixed<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.420> right

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.240 
just not meant to work or what the deal
is<00:01:14.180> but<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:15.110> some<00:01:15.290> reason<00:01:15.650> none<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.160> the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250

exterior lighting on this car works I

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.780 
exterior lighting on this car works I
don't<00:01:18.350> know<00:01:18.560> why<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:19.250> hopefully<00:01:19.610> gets

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
don't know why that is hopefully gets

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.790 
don't know why that is hopefully gets
fixed<00:01:20.150> but<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.630> think<00:01:21.140> I'm<00:01:21.200> gonna<00:01:21.380> leave<00:01:21.530> that

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
fixed but I think I'm gonna leave that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.210 
fixed but I think I'm gonna leave that
off<00:01:22.010> as<00:01:22.160> well<00:01:23.560> I'm<00:01:24.560> gonna<00:01:24.800> lower<00:01:25.070> it

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
off as well I'm gonna lower it

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.010 
off as well I'm gonna lower it
considering<00:01:26.150> I<00:01:26.270> don't<00:01:26.330> really<00:01:26.570> do<00:01:26.720> too<00:01:26.750> much

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
considering I don't really do too much

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.780 
considering I don't really do too much
off-roading<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:27.830> gonna<00:01:27.980> be<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.280> road<00:01:28.550> most

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
off-roading so I'm gonna be on road most

serious<00:03:55.310> off-road<00:03:55.670> rock<00:03:56.060> crawling<00:03:56.359> with<00:03:56.540> the

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
serious off-road rock crawling with the

serious off-road rock crawling with the
thing<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:56.900> will<00:03:57.109> pry<00:03:57.290> raise<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.709> back<00:03:57.799> up<00:03:57.859> but

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
thing I will pry raise it back up but

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.559 
thing I will pry raise it back up but
it's<00:03:59.060> whatever<00:04:00.579> for<00:04:01.579> pavement<00:04:02.000> driving<00:04:02.390> and

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
it's whatever for pavement driving and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.069 
it's whatever for pavement driving and
lowering<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.079> is<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:03.950> good<00:04:04.159> it<00:04:04.719> holds<00:04:05.719> the<00:04:05.840> road

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
lowering it is so good it holds the road

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.819 
lowering it is so good it holds the road
nice<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:07.450> know<00:04:08.450> real<00:04:08.659> drama<00:04:09.019> in<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.379> corners

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
nice to know real drama in the corners

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.289 
nice to know real drama in the corners
it<00:04:10.459> kind<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.819> pushes<00:04:11.439> really<00:04:12.439> hard<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.310> can

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
it kind of pushes really hard but I can

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.729 
it kind of pushes really hard but I can
manage<00:04:14.599> that<00:04:14.810> with<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.230> little<00:04:15.409> bit<00:04:15.530> more

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
manage that with a little bit more

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.330 
manage that with a little bit more
braking<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.989> overall<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.739> thing<00:04:18.799> sounds

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
braking but overall this thing sounds

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.839 
braking but overall this thing sounds
nice

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
nice

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.570 
nice
it<00:04:20.030> goes<00:04:20.630> hard<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.769> thing<00:04:21.949> is<00:04:22.130> overall

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
it goes hard and the thing is overall

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.820 
it goes hard and the thing is overall
pretty<00:04:22.940> 10<00:04:23.389> out<00:04:23.509> of<00:04:23.599> 10<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.139> I'm<00:04:24.349> definitely

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
pretty 10 out of 10 and I'm definitely

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.770 
pretty 10 out of 10 and I'm definitely
keeping<00:04:24.919> this<00:04:25.190> thing<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.430> my<00:04:25.520> garage<00:04:25.780> after

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150

all I think it's modeled after a local
