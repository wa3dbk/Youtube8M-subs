designer and founder of green eagle and
us<00:00:09.170> paragliding<00:00:09.650> we're<00:00:10.309> at<00:00:10.429> the<00:00:10.549> Salton<00:00:10.910> Sea

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
us paragliding we're at the Salton Sea

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.930 
us paragliding we're at the Salton Sea
and<00:00:11.620> basically<00:00:12.620> it's<00:00:12.860> just<00:00:12.919> a<00:00:13.129> conglomeration

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
and basically it's just a conglomeration

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.459 
and basically it's just a conglomeration
of<00:00:14.030> pilots<00:00:14.389> from<00:00:14.480> all<00:00:14.660> over<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.990> world<00:00:15.169> all

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
of pilots from all over the world all

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.540 
of pilots from all over the world all
over<00:00:15.620> the<00:00:15.679> United<00:00:15.950> States<00:00:16.010> that<00:00:16.400> come

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
over the United States that come

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.460 
over the United States that come
together<00:00:16.700> it's<00:00:17.450> called<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:17.750> fly-in<00:00:18.020> and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
together it's called a fly-in and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.010 
together it's called a fly-in and
there's<00:00:19.400> probably<00:00:19.520> around<00:00:19.760> 250<00:00:20.510> pilots<00:00:20.870> out

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
there's probably around 250 pilots out

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.320 
there's probably around 250 pilots out
here<00:00:21.260> everything<00:00:21.620> from<00:00:21.830> hang<00:00:22.730> glider<00:00:22.940> trikes

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
here everything from hang glider trikes

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.630 
here everything from hang glider trikes
that<00:00:23.510> are<00:00:23.600> motorized<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.440> motorized<00:00:25.310> powered

paragliders<00:00:27.740> there's<00:00:28.400> an<00:00:28.520> electric<00:00:28.850> plane

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
paragliders there's an electric plane

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.700 
paragliders there's an electric plane
out<00:00:29.210> here<00:00:29.450> and<00:00:29.570> then<00:00:29.660> of<00:00:29.750> course<00:00:29.780> the<00:00:30.140> Green

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
out here and then of course the Green

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.130 
out here and then of course the Green
Eagle<00:00:30.980> four-stroke<00:00:31.490> which<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.360> my<00:00:32.840> design

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
Eagle four-stroke which is my design

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.410 
Eagle four-stroke which is my design
well<00:00:33.740> basically<00:00:34.250> what<00:00:34.640> happened<00:00:34.970> was<00:00:35.090> I<00:00:35.270> was

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
well basically what happened was I was

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.240 
well basically what happened was I was
on<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.630> film<00:00:36.020> shoot<00:00:36.230> with<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.380> friend<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:36.740> mine<00:00:36.800> I

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
on a film shoot with a friend of mine I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.850 
on a film shoot with a friend of mine I
wanted<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.790> go<00:00:37.940> ahead<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:38.390> do<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.960> little<00:00:39.680> bit

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
wanted to go ahead and do a little bit

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.380 
wanted to go ahead and do a little bit
better<00:00:40.010> trike<00:00:40.400> something<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:40.970> would<00:00:41.090> work<00:00:41.120> a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
better trike something that would work a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.270 
better trike something that would work a
little<00:00:41.450> bit<00:00:41.630> better<00:00:41.780> for<00:00:42.050> our<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:42.920> our<00:00:42.980> needs

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
little bit better for our for our needs

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.850 
little bit better for our for our needs
and<00:00:43.840> nothing<00:00:44.840> was<00:00:44.960> very<00:00:45.200> environmentally

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
and nothing was very environmentally

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.560 
and nothing was very environmentally
friendly<00:00:46.430> most<00:00:46.670> things<00:00:46.910> were<00:00:47.060> very<00:00:47.329> noisy

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
friendly most things were very noisy

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.410 
friendly most things were very noisy
rattle<00:00:48.380> traps<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.670> I've<00:00:49.880> worked<00:00:50.270> with

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
rattle traps and I've worked with

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.139 
rattle traps and I've worked with
engines<00:00:50.780> most<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.140> my<00:00:51.200> life<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.550> wanted<00:00:53.030> to

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
engines most of my life so I wanted to

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.360 
engines most of my life so I wanted to
do<00:00:53.270> four-stroke<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:54.079> at<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.560> time<00:00:54.800> it<00:00:55.130> was<00:00:55.250> I

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
do four-stroke and at the time it was I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.130 
do four-stroke and at the time it was I
wanted<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.610> do<00:00:55.760> an<00:00:55.850> eco<00:00:56.149> friendly<00:00:56.180> company<00:00:56.930> so

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
wanted to do an eco friendly company so

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.049 
wanted to do an eco friendly company so
this<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.130> reason<00:00:58.280> why<00:00:58.520> we<00:00:58.670> started<00:00:58.850> out

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
this is the reason why we started out

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.910 
this is the reason why we started out
with<00:00:59.120> propane<00:00:59.510> because<00:01:00.440> we<00:01:00.649> couldn't<00:01:00.800> afford

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
with propane because we couldn't afford

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.549 
with propane because we couldn't afford
a<00:01:01.130> fuel<00:01:01.340> injection<00:01:01.640> at<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.910> time<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:03.260> did

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
a fuel injection at the time so we did

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.709 
a fuel injection at the time so we did
propane<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.250> then<00:01:04.369> we<00:01:04.489> did<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:05.269> know<00:01:05.359> multi

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
propane and then we did you know multi

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.200 
propane and then we did you know multi
fuel<00:01:05.899> or<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.259> tri<00:01:06.560> fuel<00:01:06.770> version<00:01:07.249> and<00:01:07.399> then<00:01:08.060> we

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
fuel or a tri fuel version and then we

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.819 
fuel or a tri fuel version and then we
went<00:01:08.389> to<00:01:08.539> just<00:01:08.719> regular<00:01:08.990> gasoline<00:01:09.350> because

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
went to just regular gasoline because

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.069 
went to just regular gasoline because
the<00:01:09.920> price<00:01:10.130> as<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.310> gas<00:01:10.549> dropped<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.179> so<00:01:11.780> and

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
the price as a gas dropped and so and

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.719 
the price as a gas dropped and so and
now<00:01:12.200> we're<00:01:12.319> working<00:01:12.409> on<00:01:12.649> an<00:01:12.770> electric<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.609> we

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
now we're working on an electric so we

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.399 
now we're working on an electric so we
have<00:01:13.939> we're<00:01:14.630> pretty<00:01:14.810> much<00:01:14.960> an<00:01:15.109> eco<00:01:15.350> friendly

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
have we're pretty much an eco friendly

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.499 
have we're pretty much an eco friendly
company<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.189> that's<00:01:16.249> what<00:01:16.429> we<00:01:16.520> go<00:01:16.670> with<00:01:16.909> quiet

company and that's what we go with quiet

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.770 
company and that's what we go with quiet
less<00:01:17.840> vibration<00:01:18.439> lots<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.829> power<00:01:19.149> we<00:01:20.149> are<00:01:20.329> like

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780

well<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.019> two-stroke<00:02:24.439> engines<00:02:24.829> me<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.159> me

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
well the two-stroke engines me and me

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.069 
well the two-stroke engines me and me
like<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:25.939> said<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:26.269> friend<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.569> did<00:02:26.659> film<00:02:26.930> work

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
like I said my friend that did film work

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.569 
like I said my friend that did film work
we<00:02:27.260> found<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.890> know<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.159> two<00:02:28.310> strokes

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
we found that you know the two strokes

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.699 
we found that you know the two strokes
are<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.849> consistently<00:02:29.540> unreliable<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.530> had

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
are just consistently unreliable you had

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.500 
are just consistently unreliable you had
to<00:02:30.829> find<00:02:31.040> special<00:02:31.459> oil<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.209> mix<00:02:32.359> your

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
to find special oil you have to mix your

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.300 
to find special oil you have to mix your
oil<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:32.750> your<00:02:32.840> gas<00:02:33.019> perfectly<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.950> forget

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
oil and your gas perfectly if you forget

dollars<00:02:36.859> and<00:02:37.790> not<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.209> mention<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:38.599> you're

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
dollars and not to mention if you're

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.179 
dollars and not to mention if you're
carrying<00:02:38.989> expensive<00:02:39.590> gear<00:02:39.799> then<00:02:40.069> you're

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
carrying expensive gear then you're

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.349 
carrying expensive gear then you're
going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> crash<00:02:40.609> with<00:02:40.849> that<00:02:41.090> gear<00:02:41.329> and

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
going to crash with that gear and

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.990 
going to crash with that gear and
everything<00:02:41.540> else<00:02:41.900> are<00:02:42.019> gonna<00:02:42.079> go<00:02:42.290> down<00:02:43.000> what

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
everything else are gonna go down what

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.580 
everything else are gonna go down what
what<00:02:44.299> we<00:02:44.389> want<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.629> do<00:02:44.750> with<00:02:44.900> four<00:02:45.109> strokes<00:02:45.409> was

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
what we want to do with four strokes was

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.470 
what we want to do with four strokes was
we<00:02:45.709> knew<00:02:45.889> that<00:02:46.129> we<00:02:46.340> could<00:02:46.519> use<00:02:46.849> maybe<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.239> gallon

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
we knew that we could use maybe a gallon

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.300 
we knew that we could use maybe a gallon
even<00:02:48.109> maybe<00:02:48.319> less<00:02:48.590> than<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.829> gallon<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:49.129> just

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
even maybe less than a gallon of just

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.399 
even maybe less than a gallon of just
regular<00:02:49.459> pump<00:02:49.819> gas<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.299> four<00:02:50.959> strokes<00:02:51.260> are

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
regular pump gas and four strokes are

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.559 
regular pump gas and four strokes are
just<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.620> lot<00:02:51.769> more<00:02:51.799> reliable<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.609> they<00:02:53.329> tend

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
just a lot more reliable and they tend

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.089 
just a lot more reliable and they tend
to<00:02:53.659> not<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.079> same<00:02:54.109> horsepower<00:02:54.709> as<00:02:55.069> a

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
to not have the same horsepower as a

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.849 
to not have the same horsepower as a
two-stroke<00:02:55.700> for<00:02:56.150> weight<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:57.139> they<00:02:57.260> have<00:02:57.439> they

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
two-stroke for weight but they have they

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.470 
two-stroke for weight but they have they
have<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> lot<00:02:58.189> of<00:02:58.310> torque<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.090> that's<00:02:59.299> what

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
have a lot of torque and so that's what

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.720 
have a lot of torque and so that's what
we<00:02:59.599> had<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.139> work<00:03:00.260> around<00:03:00.439> so<00:03:01.069> three<00:03:01.700> years

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
we had to work around so three years

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.750 
we had to work around so three years
later<00:03:02.120> there's<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.019> green<00:03:03.200> Engel<00:03:03.470> thing<00:03:03.829> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
later there's the green Engel thing the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.429 
later there's the green Engel thing the
