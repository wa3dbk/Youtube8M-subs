free peoples who playing with you
premade<00:01:46.479> peoples<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.750> if<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.080> do

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
premade peoples and because if you do

that with the random peoples that

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.810 
that with the random peoples that
probably<00:01:53.020> gonna<00:01:53.350> be<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.650> fail<00:01:54.130> because<00:01:54.490> you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
probably gonna be a fail because you

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.719 
probably gonna be a fail because you
need<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.030> explain<00:01:55.750> them<00:01:56.140> what<00:01:56.740> do<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.220> want<00:01:57.460> to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
need to explain them what do you want to

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.020 
need to explain them what do you want to
do<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:59.380> they<00:01:59.650> should<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.190> take<00:02:00.460> what

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
do and what they should to take what

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.210 
do and what they should to take what
characters<00:02:01.659> they<00:02:01.869> should<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.290> take<00:02:02.530> yeah

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
characters they should to take yeah

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.480 
characters they should to take yeah
that's<00:02:03.520> really<00:02:04.270> hard<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.900> do<00:02:05.259> because<00:02:05.590> they

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
that's really hard to do because they

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.900 
that's really hard to do because they
will<00:02:06.700> pick<00:02:07.000> their<00:02:07.270> characters<00:02:07.900> fast<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.910> yeah

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
will pick their characters fast and yeah

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.210 
will pick their characters fast and yeah
probably<00:02:10.509> will<00:02:10.959> not<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.380> time<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:11.980> need

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
probably will not have time so you need

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.990 
probably will not have time so you need
two<00:02:13.120> members<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:15.400> need<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
two members and you you need just to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
two members and you you need just to
have<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.239> pyramid<00:02:16.780> because<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.470> don't<00:02:17.650> have

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
have a pyramid because if you don't have

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.790 
have a pyramid because if you don't have
probably<00:02:18.580> gonna<00:02:18.940> fail<00:02:19.239> this<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
probably gonna fail this and the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.479 
probably gonna fail this and the
summoner<00:02:21.190> spells<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.360> need<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.840> take<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.489> smite

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489

pushing you all smacking minions and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.680 
pushing you all smacking minions and
yeah<00:02:32.680> you're<00:02:32.860> gonna<00:02:33.010> push<00:02:33.400> towers<00:02:33.820> faster<00:02:34.330> so

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
