the<00:02:02.780> rock<00:02:02.960> gonna<00:02:03.200> be<00:02:03.470> at<00:02:03.619> WrestleMania<00:02:04.070> 13

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
the rock gonna be at WrestleMania 13

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.060

because<00:02:04.640> he<00:02:05.030> was<00:02:05.210> buying<00:02:05.450> my<00:02:06.259> stream<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.890> mean

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
because he was buying my stream I mean

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.219 
because he was buying my stream I mean
he<00:02:07.280> wasn't<00:02:07.490> press<00:02:08.239> conference<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.869> think

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
he wasn't press conference so I think

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.690 
he wasn't press conference so I think
he's<00:02:09.530> going<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.770> be<00:02:09.860> out<00:02:09.890> there<00:02:10.009> as<00:02:10.340> well<00:02:10.550> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
he's going to be out there as well and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.910 
he's going to be out there as well and
Brock<00:02:10.880> Lesnar<00:02:11.090> got<00:02:11.360> two<00:02:11.569> years<00:02:11.840> contract

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
Brock Lesnar got two years contract

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.380 
Brock Lesnar got two years contract
so<00:02:13.130> probably<00:02:13.520> he's<00:02:13.700> going<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> be<00:02:14.000> honest<00:02:14.209> man

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so probably he's going to be honest man

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.850 
so probably he's going to be honest man
