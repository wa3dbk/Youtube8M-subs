well<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.980> think<00:04:00.070> it's<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.280> bad<00:04:00.400> idea<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:00.940> know

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
well we think it's a bad idea you know

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.480 
well we think it's a bad idea you know
it's<00:04:01.210> it's<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.960> Green<00:04:02.170> River<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.590> real<00:04:03.280> nice

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
it's it's the Green River is a real nice

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.250 
it's it's the Green River is a real nice

2<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:06.400> idea<00:04:06.580> is<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:06.970> take<00:04:07.120> about<00:04:07.540> 200,000

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
2 and this idea is to take about 200,000
