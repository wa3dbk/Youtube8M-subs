00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
sometimes I realize that I don't like a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
sometimes I realize that I don't like a
video<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.240> mine<00:01:12.450> while<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.590> rendering<00:01:14.100> or

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
video of mine while it's rendering or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
video of mine while it's rendering or

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
just after I do it in which case I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440 
just after I do it in which case I
canceled<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> render<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.880> delete<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
canceled the render or I just delete the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.929 
canceled the render or I just delete the
commentary<00:01:19.259> aspect<00:01:19.710> completely<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> redo<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
on the spot other times i rendered I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
on the spot other times i rendered I
think<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.299> okay<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.080> least<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
think it's okay or at least it's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.819 
think it's okay or at least it's
suitable<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:27.450> always<00:01:27.900> want<00:01:28.140> re<00:01:28.409> watch<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
suitable and I always want re watch a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.359 
suitable and I always want re watch a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
video just before I upload it even if I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.670 
video just before I upload it even if I
thought<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.820> initially<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.680> after

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
thought it was initially good after

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
thought it was initially good after
rendering<00:01:35.450> maybe<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.540> couple<00:01:36.810> hours<00:01:37.049> later<00:01:37.229> or

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
rendering maybe a couple hours later or

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
rendering maybe a couple hours later or
a<00:01:37.770> day<00:01:38.100> or<00:01:38.130> two<00:01:38.430> later<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.119> ready<00:01:39.299> to

a day or two later when I'm ready to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.410 
a day or two later when I'm ready to
upload<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.250> always<00:01:41.250> watch<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.759> again<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
upload it I always watch it again on the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.560 
upload it I always watch it again on the
odd<00:01:42.570> chance<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.619> don't<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
odd chance that I just don't like it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
odd chance that I just don't like it
okay<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.170> always<00:01:46.740> comes<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.690 
didn't like it and I've been trying it
again<00:03:27.600> recently<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> silencer<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.370> I

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
again recently with the silencer and I

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.750 
again recently with the silencer and I
actually<00:03:29.880> liked<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.540> quite<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.780> lot<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:32.100> sucks

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
actually liked it quite a lot it sucks

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.110 
actually liked it quite a lot it sucks
at<00:03:33.090> anything<00:03:33.900> more<00:03:34.140> than<00:03:34.350> medium<00:03:34.769> range<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
at anything more than medium range the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.630 
at anything more than medium range the
iron<00:03:36.299> sights<00:03:36.570> are<00:03:36.780> decent<00:03:37.320> but<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.829> mean

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
iron sights are decent but I mean

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.100 
iron sights are decent but I mean
they're<00:03:38.880> not<00:03:39.030> good<00:03:39.329> enough<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.079> job

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
they're not good enough to get the job

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.890 
they're not good enough to get the job
done<00:03:40.380> against<00:03:41.370> something<00:03:41.579> like<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.030> g11<00:03:42.269> at

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
done against something like the g11 at

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.150 
done against something like the g11 at
long<00:03:43.140> range<00:03:43.410> you're<00:03:43.590> gonna<00:03:43.680> get<00:03:43.860> your<00:03:44.010> ass

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
long range you're gonna get your ass

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.390 
long range you're gonna get your ass
kicked<00:03:44.810> butt<00:03:45.810> on<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.079> map<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.560> nuketown<00:03:47.130> or

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
kicked butt on a map like nuketown or

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.880 
kicked butt on a map like nuketown or
even<00:03:47.820> grid<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.840> you're<00:03:48.989> staying<00:03:49.230> inside<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
even grid if you're staying inside the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.680 
even grid if you're staying inside the
buildings<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.820> know<00:03:50.970> keeping<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:51.450> close

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
buildings and you know keeping it close

quarters<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.170> shit<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:53.130> should<00:03:53.519> be<00:03:53.700> really

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
quarters and shit you should be really

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.630 
quarters and shit you should be really

Brady's<00:04:10.920> better<00:04:11.959> Vic<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.530> season<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.190> better

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
Brady's better Vic this season is better

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.550 
Brady's better Vic this season is better
and<00:04:14.730> then<00:04:15.330> i<00:04:15.390> would<00:04:15.540> say<00:04:15.690> Matt<00:04:15.870> Ryan's<00:04:16.289> third

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
and then i would say Matt Ryan's third

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.199 
and then i would say Matt Ryan's third
and<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.979> lot<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.310> people<00:04:17.669> don't<00:04:17.849> think<00:04:17.970> that

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and a lot of people don't think that

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.910 
and a lot of people don't think that
they<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:18.870> think<00:04:19.229> he's<00:04:19.380> surrounded

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
they just think he's surrounded

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.950 
they just think he's surrounded
good<00:04:20.160> receivers<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.880> that's<00:04:21.030> how<00:04:21.180> he<00:04:21.210> has<00:04:21.720> had

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960

the
Fallout<00:06:33.300> community<00:06:33.839> because<00:06:34.169> let's<00:06:34.979> face<00:06:35.099> it

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:38.249 
that's a pretty small community not just

that's a pretty small community not just
the<00:06:38.550> Minecraft<00:06:39.089> community<00:06:39.179> but<00:06:39.749> all<00:06:40.189> kinds<00:06:41.189> of
