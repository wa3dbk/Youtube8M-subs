things have been selling in the time and
just<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.870> prices<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
just the way that the prices in the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.250 
just the way that the prices in the
auction<00:00:41.040> house<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.700> influencing<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.140> way

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
auction house are influencing the way

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.010 
auction house are influencing the way
people<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.040> buying<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> first<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.600> idea

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
people are buying so the first time idea

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
people are buying so the first time idea
is<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.530> you're<00:00:46.649> probably<00:00:46.890> already

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
is one that you're probably already

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.920 
is one that you're probably already
pretty<00:00:47.879> familiar<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.750> bear<00:00:48.899> with

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
pretty familiar with but just bear with

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
pretty familiar with but just bear with
me<00:00:49.110> until<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.250> sort<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.520> need<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
me until it because I sort of need to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
me until it because I sort of need to
explain<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> set<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> baseline<00:00:52.129> for<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
explain it to set a baseline for the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.660 
explain it to set a baseline for the
rest<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> ideas<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.920> this<00:00:55.920> idea<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
rest of the ideas and this idea is of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.660 
rest of the ideas and this idea is of
relative<00:00:57.390> purchasing<00:00:57.960> power<00:00:58.370> basically<00:00:59.370> some

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
relative purchasing power basically some

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
relative purchasing power basically some
people<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.270> more<00:01:00.629> financially<00:01:01.140> wealthier

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
people are more financially wealthier

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.549 
people are more financially wealthier
than<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.399> time<00:01:02.879> wealthy<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.559> Diablos

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
than they are time wealthy and Diablos

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.070 
than they are time wealthy and Diablos
and<00:01:04.830> old<00:01:04.949> series<00:01:05.400> people<00:01:06.360> playing<00:01:06.630> Diablo<00:01:07.020> 2

when<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:07.920> were<00:01:07.979> teenagers<00:01:08.400> probably<00:01:08.790> now

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
when they were teenagers probably now

professional career and earning power

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.840 
professional career and earning power
and<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.740> do<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.369> did

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and I want to do what they do we did

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
and I want to do what they do we did
with<00:01:18.119> Diablo<00:01:18.540> 2<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
with Diablo 2 but they don't have the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.260 
with Diablo 2 but they don't have the
time<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> spend<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.909> sort<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> thing

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
time to spend on that sort of thing

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
time to spend on that sort of thing
anymore<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.990> while<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> money

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
anymore so while they do have the money

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.690 
anymore so while they do have the money
they<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.259> essentially<00:01:25.259> bypass<00:01:25.950> some<00:01:26.250> content

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
they can essentially bypass some content

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
they can essentially bypass some content
by<00:01:26.880> paying<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.570> money<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.200> know

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
by paying a bit of that money you know

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.800 
by paying a bit of that money you know
maybe<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.799> couple<00:01:29.640> hours<00:01:29.970> work<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.509> them<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
maybe a couple hours work for them and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
maybe a couple hours work for them and
they<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:30.900> bypass<00:01:31.700> heaps<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.820> heaps<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.150> hours

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
they can bypass heaps and heaps of hours

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.350 
they can bypass heaps and heaps of hours
or<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.990> game<00:01:34.229> play<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.150> end

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
or in game play and get up to that end

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
or in game play and get up to that end
game<00:01:36.540> content<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.130> sort<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> sets<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
game content so that sort of sets a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.050 
game content so that sort of sets a
baseline<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.329> who<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.990> buying<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.060> basically

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
baseline for who is buying and basically

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
baseline for who is buying and basically
their<00:01:42.329> relative<00:01:42.780> purchasing<00:01:43.320> power<00:01:43.619> now<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
reason that they're actually spending

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
reason that they're actually spending
the<00:01:45.960> amount<00:01:46.020> they're<00:01:46.409> spending<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.950> these

the amount they're spending on these

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
the amount they're spending on these
items<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> an<00:01:48.540> idea<00:01:48.840> called

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
items is because of an idea called

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.289 
items is because of an idea called
quality<00:01:49.890> leadership<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> probably

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
quality leadership now you probably

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.960 
quality leadership now you probably
already<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> good<00:01:51.990> idea<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.820> pricing<00:01:53.820> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
already have a good idea that pricing is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.440 
already have a good idea that pricing is
a<00:01:54.030> valuable<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.110> communicate<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.450> value

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
a valuable way to communicate the value

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.709 
a valuable way to communicate the value
of<00:01:57.630> an<00:01:57.780> item<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.259> customers<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
of an item to customers so this is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.060 
of an item to customers so this is
something<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:00.990> kripparian<00:02:01.710> actually

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
something that kripparian actually

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.880 
something that kripparian actually
mentioned<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.520> people<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:03.000> seeing<00:02:03.500> two<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
mentioned that people are seeing two of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.280 
mentioned that people are seeing two of
the<00:02:05.219> same<00:02:05.460> item<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.149> or<00:02:06.299> similar<00:02:06.659> items<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the same item here or similar items and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.059 
the same item here or similar items and
they're<00:02:08.160> seeing<00:02:09.110> 150<00:02:10.110> buyout<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.679> one

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
they're seeing 150 buyout in this one

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.520 
they're seeing 150 buyout in this one
250<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.239> there's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> bunch<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
250 and then there's a bunch of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.090 
250 and then there's a bunch of
around<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> $200<00:02:14.850> marks<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.680> instant

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
around the $200 marks so the instant

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.290 
around the $200 marks so the instant
thought<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.459> someone<00:02:17.700> who's<00:02:17.850> not<00:02:18.000> willing<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
thought for someone who's not willing to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.880 
thought for someone who's not willing to
look<00:02:18.510> into<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.680> much<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.020> $250

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
look into this as much is that the $250

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
look into this as much is that the $250
item<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.630> superior

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
item is superior

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
item is superior
so<00:02:25.890> while<00:02:26.069> high<00:02:26.250> price<00:02:26.580> gives<00:02:27.540> us<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> idea

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
so while high price gives us the idea

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.380 
so while high price gives us the idea
that<00:02:28.410> an<00:02:28.590> item<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.310> height<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.060> highest

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that an item is of height the highest

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.990 
that an item is of height the highest
quality<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.739> case<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.550> buyout<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
quality and in this case the buyout is a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900 
quality and in this case the buyout is a
maximum<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> 250<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.430> hitting<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> maximum

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
maximum of 250 and hitting the maximum

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.170 
maximum of 250 and hitting the maximum
250<00:02:36.450> instantly<00:02:37.260> sends<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:38.100> signal<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.670> this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
250 instantly sends a signal that this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.410 
250 instantly sends a signal that this
is<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> best<00:02:40.380> items<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.890> game

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
is one of the best items in the game

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.300 
is one of the best items in the game
this<00:02:42.420> price<00:02:42.810> needs<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.410> reinforced<00:02:44.220> by

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
this price needs to be reinforced by

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
this price needs to be reinforced by
lower<00:02:45.030> prices<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:47.180> when<00:02:48.180> seeing<00:02:48.510> these<00:02:48.989> two

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
lower prices and when seeing these two

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.160 
lower prices and when seeing these two
prices<00:02:49.680> side<00:02:50.070> by<00:02:50.280> side<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:51.090> actually

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
prices side by side it actually

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.160 
prices side by side it actually
reinforces<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> value<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:54.269> item<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.810> the

reinforces the value of this item in the

reinforces the value of this item in the
eye<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:56.220> purchaser<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.630> someone<00:02:58.050> who

eye of the purchaser so someone who

plays<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.769> game<00:02:58.920> fairly<00:02:59.250> serious<00:02:59.730> it's

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
plays the game fairly serious it's

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.390 
plays the game fairly serious it's
propped<00:03:00.300> probably<00:03:01.290> pretty<00:03:01.560> hard<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
propped probably pretty hard to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.910 
propped probably pretty hard to
understand<00:03:03.000> why<00:03:03.360> someone<00:03:04.260> would<00:03:04.410> be<00:03:04.709> mistaken

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
understand why someone would be mistaken

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.410 
understand why someone would be mistaken
between<00:03:05.640> thinking<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.760> item<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.239> this

item is $100 price gap and why this item

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.280 
item is $100 price gap and why this item
is<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.319> much<00:03:13.470> better<00:03:13.970> well<00:03:14.970> try<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.959> think<00:03:16.170> of

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
is so much better well try to think of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.199 
is so much better well try to think of

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
think about this too much but get

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.780 
think about this too much but get
something<00:03:58.470> that's<00:03:58.680> good<00:03:58.950> or<00:03:59.130> reasonably<00:03:59.609> good

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
something that's good or reasonably good

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.940 
something that's good or reasonably good
now<00:04:00.209> you're<00:04:00.390> either<00:04:00.480> going<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> go<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
now you're either going to go for the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.340 
now you're either going to go for the
highest<00:04:02.160> one<00:04:02.549> which<00:04:03.000> isn't<00:04:03.209> as<00:04:03.510> actually

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
highest one which isn't as actually

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.400 
highest one which isn't as actually
common<00:04:04.709> but<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.450> real<00:04:06.600> world<00:04:06.810> most<00:04:07.290> people

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
common but in the real world most people

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.170 
common but in the real world most people
tend<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.769> go<00:04:07.920> for<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.190> next<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.519> behind<00:04:08.940> that

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
tend to go for the next one behind that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.000 
tend to go for the next one behind that
so<00:04:09.420> instead<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.350> 200<00:04:10.739> old<00:04:10.859> blender

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
so instead of the 200 old blender

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.650 
so instead of the 200 old blender
they'll<00:04:11.250> go<00:04:11.370> for<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.579> hundred<00:04:11.880> $50<00:04:12.299> blender

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
they'll go for the hundred $50 blender

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.140 
they'll go for the hundred $50 blender
thinking<00:04:12.989> they're<00:04:13.109> getting<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.350> bargain<00:04:13.590> and

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
thinking they're getting a bargain and

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.279 
thinking they're getting a bargain and
getting<00:04:15.150> still<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.380> higher-quality<00:04:17.220> item<00:04:18.289> now

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
getting still a higher-quality item now

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.009 
getting still a higher-quality item now
this<00:04:19.440> isn't<00:04:19.739> actually<00:04:19.859> tricking<00:04:20.489> people<00:04:21.019> into

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
this isn't actually tricking people into

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.360 
this isn't actually tricking people into
thinking<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.470> they're<00:04:22.740> getting<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:23.130> better

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
thinking that they're getting a better

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.190 
thinking that they're getting a better
item<00:04:23.520> than<00:04:23.909> they're<00:04:24.090> getting<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.930> just

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
item than they're getting it's just

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.900 
item than they're getting it's just
communicating<00:04:26.010> value<00:04:26.159> and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
communicating value and

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.520 
communicating value and
as<00:04:27.030> one<00:04:27.390> of<00:04:27.420> my<00:04:27.570> commenters<00:04:27.990> pointed<00:04:28.020> out<00:04:28.410> in

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
as one of my commenters pointed out in

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.590 
as one of my commenters pointed out in
my<00:04:28.560> last<00:04:28.740> video<00:04:29.070> value<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.270> eye<00:04:30.300> of<00:04:30.390> the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
my last video value is in the eye of the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.290 
my last video value is in the eye of the
purchaser<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.580> does<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.820> mean<00:04:33.030> as<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
purchaser so what does this mean as the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.380 
purchaser so what does this mean as the
seller<00:04:33.540> well<00:04:34.350> although<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.580> prices<00:04:36.030> don't

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
seller well although the prices don't

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.900 
seller well although the prices don't
quite<00:04:36.750> make<00:04:36.900> sense<00:04:36.960> at<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.530> moment<00:04:37.920> prices

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
quite make sense at the moment prices

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.130 
quite make sense at the moment prices
are<00:04:39.030> relative<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.600> each<00:04:39.690> other

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
are relative to each other

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.710 
are relative to each other
so<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:40.950> you're<00:04:41.100> trying<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.520> price<00:04:41.730> an<00:04:41.940> item<00:04:42.240> like

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
so if you're trying a price an item like

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.120 
so if you're trying a price an item like
a<00:04:42.780> wizard<00:04:42.990> spike<00:04:43.410> here<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.980> almost<00:04:46.980> as

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
a wizard spike here and it is almost as

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.970 
a wizard spike here and it is almost as
good<00:04:47.280> as<00:04:47.430> some<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.970> best<00:04:48.120> items<00:04:48.300> on<00:04:48.570> here

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
good as some of the best items on here

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.860 
good as some of the best items on here
pricing<00:04:49.980> at<00:04:50.190> or<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:50.460> below<00:04:50.880> like<00:04:51.450> these<00:04:51.690> two

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
pricing at or just below like these two

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.960 
pricing at or just below like these two
forty<00:04:52.170> five<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.590> thirty<00:04:52.890> ones<00:04:53.100> things<00:04:53.760> like

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
forty five to thirty ones things like

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.060 
forty five to thirty ones things like
that<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:55.020> probably<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.560> good<00:04:55.860> way<00:04:56.010> to

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
that is probably a good way to

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.440 
that is probably a good way to
communicate<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.790> this<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.120> one<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.390> the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
communicate that this is one of the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.710 
communicate that this is one of the
higher<00:04:57.630> value<00:04:58.020> items<00:04:58.320> in<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.530> game<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:59.760> it<00:05:00.540> is

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
higher value items in the game but it is

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.720 
higher value items in the game but it is
more<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.110> bargain<00:05:01.470> even<00:05:02.340> if<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.550> don't

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
more of a bargain even if you don't

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.370 
more of a bargain even if you don't
think<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.210> item<00:05:03.480> is<00:05:03.570> worth<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.930> much<00:05:04.110> real

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
think the item is worth that much real

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.530 
think the item is worth that much real
money<00:05:04.560> yourself<00:05:05.030> however<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.090> actually<00:05:06.240> have<00:05:06.510> a

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
money yourself however I actually have a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.080 
money yourself however I actually have a
bit<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.870> theory<00:05:07.200> when<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.440> comes<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.940> way

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
bit of a theory when it comes to the way

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.790 
bit of a theory when it comes to the way
Diablo<00:05:09.570> plays<00:05:09.810> out<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.050> comparison<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.590> the

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
Diablo plays out in comparison to the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.280 
Diablo plays out in comparison to the
real<00:05:10.980> world<00:05:11.220> where<00:05:11.900> in<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:12.990> real<00:05:13.140> world

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
real world where in the real world

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.690 
real world where in the real world
people<00:05:13.350> will<00:05:13.620> go<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:14.070> something<00:05:14.310> that's<00:05:14.580> a

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
people will go for something that's a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.600 
people will go for something that's a
bit<00:05:14.850> more<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.480> bargain<00:05:15.960> or<00:05:16.460> people<00:05:17.460> are

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
bit more of a bargain or people are

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.330 
bit more of a bargain or people are
happy<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:17.910> settle<00:05:18.240> for<00:05:18.450> not<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.780> best<00:05:18.960> item

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
happy to settle for not the best item

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.120 
happy to settle for not the best item
but<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.610> think<00:05:21.090> in<00:05:21.240> Diablo<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:22.050> people<00:05:22.410> want

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
but I think in Diablo that people want

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.850 
but I think in Diablo that people want
to<00:05:23.250> have<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:24.060> best<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.960> everything<00:05:25.140> I<00:05:25.650> guess

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
to have the best of everything I guess

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.890 
to have the best of everything I guess
it's<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.160> you're<00:05:26.970> buying<00:05:27.240> something<00:05:27.510> for

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
it's like you're buying something for

well<00:05:42.330> yesterday<00:05:42.990> I<00:05:43.200> think<00:05:43.860> things<00:05:44.250> are

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
well yesterday I think things are

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.560 
well yesterday I think things are
actually<00:05:44.490> starting<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:44.940> settle<00:05:45.240> down<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.419> bit

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
actually starting to settle down a bit

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.300 
actually starting to settle down a bit
now<00:05:45.930> but<00:05:46.560> they<00:05:46.680> are<00:05:46.710> still<00:05:46.919> going<00:05:47.010> to<00:05:47.160> work

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
now but they are still going to work

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.420 
now but they are still going to work
just<00:05:47.640> a<00:05:47.820> bit<00:05:48.030> just<00:05:48.690> relative<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> scaling

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
just a bit just relative to a scaling

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.820 
just a bit just relative to a scaling
back<00:05:50.640> price<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:51.930> while<00:05:52.440> these<00:05:52.590> ones

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
back price so that while these ones

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.010 
back price so that while these ones
probably<00:05:53.220> aren't<00:05:53.490> selling<00:05:53.850> now<00:05:54.000> ones<00:05:54.720> a

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
probably aren't selling now ones a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.230 
probably aren't selling now ones a
couple<00:05:55.230> pages<00:05:55.530> down<00:05:55.919> that<00:05:56.310> price<00:05:56.760> comparing

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
couple pages down that price comparing

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.320 
couple pages down that price comparing
like<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.540> $85<00:05:58.260> one<00:05:58.440> compared<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:58.919> $75<00:05:59.580> $70

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
like the $85 one compared to a $75 $70

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.650 
like the $85 one compared to a $75 $70
one<00:06:00.510> will<00:06:01.500> start<00:06:02.040> selling<00:06:02.419> relative<00:06:03.419> to<00:06:03.540> each

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
one will start selling relative to each

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.400 
one will start selling relative to each
other<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:04.110> have<00:06:04.710> those<00:06:04.919> quality<00:06:05.760> perceptions

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
other and have those quality perceptions

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.930 
other and have those quality perceptions
so<00:06:07.410> basically<00:06:08.130> things<00:06:08.370> are<00:06:08.580> still<00:06:08.760> going

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
so basically things are still going

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.940 
so basically things are still going
crazy<00:06:09.300> and<00:06:09.690> if<00:06:09.960> you<00:06:10.080> have<00:06:10.230> some<00:06:10.410> items<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.800> sell

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
crazy and if you have some items to sell

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.370 
crazy and if you have some items to sell
that<00:06:11.130> don't<00:06:11.340> need<00:06:11.550> even<00:06:11.790> if<00:06:12.000> they're<00:06:12.380> mediocre

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
that don't need even if they're mediocre

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.060 
that don't need even if they're mediocre
