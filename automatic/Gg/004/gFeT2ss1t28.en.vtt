well the first things you notice with
the<00:00:46.050> new<00:00:46.710> plunge<00:00:47.670> base<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.359> this<00:00:49.289> alignment

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
the new plunge base is this alignment

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.919 
the new plunge base is this alignment
pin<00:00:50.780> inside<00:00:51.859> that<00:00:52.859> aligns<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:54.089> router<00:00:54.480> motor

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
pin inside that aligns the router motor

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.419 
pin inside that aligns the router motor
and<00:00:55.699> it's<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.940> positive<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.069> put

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
and it's very positive so you just put

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.829 
and it's very positive so you just put

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
thing to use it's very positive it's

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.279 
thing to use it's very positive it's
nice<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.820> light<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:56.450> what<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.020> far

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
nice it's light and what I see so far

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.880 
nice it's light and what I see so far
I<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.759> first<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.740> one<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
I like it the first thing you one of the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.469 
I like it the first thing you one of the
first<00:02:02.130> thing<00:02:02.340> you'd<00:02:02.549> notice<00:02:02.999> also<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
first thing you'd notice also is this

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
first thing you'd notice also is this
locking<00:02:06.479> lever<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:08.869> very<00:02:09.869> positive<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.770> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
locking lever then very positive and it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.490 
locking lever then very positive and it
locks<00:02:11.160> tightly<00:02:11.940> surprisingly<00:02:12.659> you<00:02:13.349> would

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
locks tightly surprisingly you would

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.370 
locks tightly surprisingly you would
think<00:02:13.709> maybe<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.700> wouldn't<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.000> too<00:02:15.239> tight<00:02:15.540> but

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
think maybe it wouldn't be too tight but

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.900 
think maybe it wouldn't be too tight but
I<00:02:16.410> haven't<00:02:16.710> been<00:02:16.830> able<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.100> move<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.460> once<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I haven't been able to move it once it's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.590 
I haven't been able to move it once it's
locked<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.400> plunge<00:02:20.700> action<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.390> is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
locked but the plunge action is is

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.910 
locked but the plunge action is is
pretty<00:02:22.020> smooth<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:26.240> just<00:02:27.240> seems<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:27.990> nice

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
pretty smooth and just seems to be nice

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.520 
pretty smooth and just seems to be nice
feels<00:02:29.400> good<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.690> anyway<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.840> 2-0<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
feels good I like it anyway the 2-0 the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.580 
feels good I like it anyway the 2-0 the
router<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.100> first<00:02:38.310> thing<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.610> would<00:02:38.820> do<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
router the first thing you would do is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.520 
router the first thing you would do is
to<00:02:40.590> set<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.880> would<00:02:42.230> your<00:02:43.230> router

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
to set it so that it would your router

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.580 
to set it so that it would your router
bit<00:02:43.890> would<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.400> zeroed<00:02:45.270> out<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.810> zero<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
bit would be zeroed out or zero to the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.180 
bit would be zeroed out or zero to the
bottom<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.690> can<00:02:48.960> take<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:50.160> lever

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
bottom and then you can take this lever

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.890 
bottom and then you can take this lever
push<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.400> down<00:02:53.610> onto<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.120> turret<00:02:55.310> set<00:02:56.310> your

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
push it down onto the turret set your

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.480 
push it down onto the turret set your
this<00:02:57.900> moves<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.590> down<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.830> scale<00:03:01.830> thing

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
this moves up and down this scale thing

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.680 
this moves up and down this scale thing
so<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.090> set<00:03:03.510> your<00:03:03.540> scale<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:05.790> zero<00:03:06.180> which<00:03:06.540> is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
so you set your scale to zero which is

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
so you set your scale to zero which is
in<00:03:06.990> inches<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.010> millimeters<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.470> lock<00:03:10.470> it

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
in inches and millimeters and lock it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.450 
in inches and millimeters and lock it
down<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:13.610> you're<00:03:14.610> set<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.290> depth<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.830> zero

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
down and you're set to the depth of zero

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.970 
down and you're set to the depth of zero
at<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.880> point<00:03:18.500> now<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.950> way<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> use<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.670> to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
at this point now the way I use it to

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.890 
at this point now the way I use it to
set<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:24.080> four<00:03:25.080> inlays<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:26.460> I<00:03:26.760> would<00:03:26.970> it's

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
set the four inlays is I would it's

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.000 
set the four inlays is I would it's
locked<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:30.030> zero<00:03:30.480> depth<00:03:30.930> right<00:03:31.230> now<00:03:31.380> turn

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
locked it at zero depth right now turn

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.360 
locked it at zero depth right now turn
this<00:03:32.280> knob<00:03:32.550> loosen<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.710> then<00:03:34.710> I<00:03:34.740> would<00:03:34.950> raise

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
this knob loosen this then I would raise

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.390 
this knob loosen this then I would raise
the<00:03:36.120> lever<00:03:37.010> take<00:03:38.010> an<00:03:38.190> inlay<00:03:38.670> or<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:38.970> banding<00:03:40.400> put

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
the lever take an inlay or a banding put

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.320 
the lever take an inlay or a banding put
it<00:03:41.520> between<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.800> pin<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:45.500> turret<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
it between the pin and the turret and

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.880 
it between the pin and the turret and
then<00:03:48.330> lock<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.430> now<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.490> depth<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:52.020> my

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
then lock it in now the depth of my

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.630 
then lock it in now the depth of my
router<00:03:53.370> bit<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.680> exactly<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.950> depth<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.459> this

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
router bit is exactly the depth of this

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.199 
router bit is exactly the depth of this
bin<00:03:56.940> what<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.840> want<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.400> lower<00:03:59.790> this

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
bin what I want to do is to lower this

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.820 
bin what I want to do is to lower this
lever<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:02.780> hair<00:04:06.260> maybe<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.470> few

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
lever just a hair maybe a few

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.820 
lever just a hair maybe a few
thousandths<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.700> an<00:04:08.880> inch<00:04:09.060> lower<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.830> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
thousandths of an inch lower so that the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.599 
thousandths of an inch lower so that the
depth<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.400> set<00:04:15.380> slightly<00:04:16.380> less<00:04:16.770> than<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
depth is set slightly less than the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.580 
depth is set slightly less than the
thickness<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.330> banding<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:19.560> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
thickness of this banding so that when I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.190 
thickness of this banding so that when I
am<00:04:19.770> away<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.220> banding<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.330> stands<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:22.020> little

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
am away this banding it stands a little

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.010 
am away this banding it stands a little
bit<00:04:22.410> proud<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:23.970> could<00:04:24.300> sand<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.810> or

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
bit proud so that I could sand it or

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.659 
bit proud so that I could sand it or
scrape<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.500> flush<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.250> sir

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
scrape it flush with the sir

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.909 
scrape it flush with the sir
and<00:04:26.939> I'll<00:04:27.030> show<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.360> how<00:04:28.319> I'm<00:04:28.469> going<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.800> do

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
and I'll show you how I'm going to do

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.929 
and I'll show you how I'm going to do
that<00:04:29.069> so<00:04:29.669> now<00:04:29.879> I<00:04:29.909> have<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.479> depth<00:04:31.460> let's<00:04:32.460> turn

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
that so now I have the depth let's turn

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.920 
that so now I have the depth let's turn
this<00:04:33.120> time<00:04:33.419> off<00:04:33.860> something<00:04:34.860> else<00:04:35.099> going<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.930> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
this time off something else going on so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.619 
this time off something else going on so
now<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.110> have<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:37.439> depth<00:04:37.680> set<00:04:38.389> to<00:04:39.389> just

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
now I have the depth set to just

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.510 
now I have the depth set to just
slightly<00:04:40.050> less<00:04:40.259> than<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.680> thickness<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:41.219> this

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
slightly less than the thickness of this

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.850 
slightly less than the thickness of this
banding<00:04:42.590> okay

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
banding okay

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.659 
banding okay
so<00:04:44.639> now<00:04:44.819> what<00:04:45.090> I'll<00:04:45.240> do<00:04:45.539> and<00:04:46.499> you<00:04:47.279> won't

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
so now what I'll do and you won't

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:54.709 
so now what I'll do and you won't
probably<00:04:47.909> want<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.680> recalibrate<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:53.719> I'm

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
probably want to recalibrate this I'm

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:59.959 
probably want to recalibrate this I'm
just<00:04:54.930> setting<00:04:55.439> a<00:04:56.930> fence<00:04:58.159> this<00:04:59.159> is<00:04:59.370> my<00:04:59.580> fence

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
just setting a fence this is my fence

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.179 
just setting a fence this is my fence
that<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.419> router<00:05:00.629> base<00:05:01.199> is<00:05:01.439> going<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.860> slide

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.189 
that the router base is going to slide

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.110 
that the router base is going to slide
on<00:05:03.169> so<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.409> my<00:05:04.620> line<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.400> route<00:05:05.789> will<00:05:05.969> be

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
on so that my line that I route will be

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.990 
on so that my line that I route will be
straight<00:05:07.129> another<00:05:08.129> nice<00:05:08.370> thing<00:05:08.400> I<00:05:08.729> like<00:05:08.969> about

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
straight another nice thing I like about

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.330 
straight another nice thing I like about
it<00:05:09.389> is<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.659> round<00:05:10.020> sub<00:05:10.590> base<00:05:10.830> it's<00:05:11.159> got<00:05:11.310> a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
it is the round sub base it's got a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.820 
it is the round sub base it's got a
round<00:05:11.669> sub<00:05:12.090> base<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:12.599> that<00:05:12.629> you<00:05:12.990> can<00:05:13.229> route<00:05:13.560> in

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
round sub base so that you can route in

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.409 
round sub base so that you can route in
any<00:05:14.550> attitude<00:05:15.560> going<00:05:16.560> across<00:05:16.860> here<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.669> the

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
any attitude going across here and the

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.110 
any attitude going across here and the
distance<00:05:19.409> between<00:05:19.529> the<00:05:20.189> edge<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:20.849> and

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
distance between the edge of this and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.140 
distance between the edge of this and
the<00:05:21.750> router<00:05:22.050> bit<00:05:22.379> is<00:05:22.589> going<00:05:23.039> to<00:05:23.279> stay<00:05:23.849> constant

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
the router bit is going to stay constant

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.769 
the router bit is going to stay constant
that's<00:05:24.930> very<00:05:25.259> important<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.180> now<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.240> have<00:05:27.599> this

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
that's very important so now I have this

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.439 
that's very important so now I have this
thing<00:05:27.979> walk<00:05:28.979> out<00:05:29.189> now<00:05:29.310> what<00:05:29.460> I'll<00:05:29.639> do<00:05:29.849> is<00:05:29.879> open

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
thing walk out now what I'll do is open

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.519 
thing walk out now what I'll do is open
my<00:05:31.069> unlock<00:05:32.069> my<00:05:32.310> plunge<00:05:32.969> lever<00:05:33.330> here<00:05:33.750> plunge

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
my unlock my plunge lever here plunge

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.869 
my unlock my plunge lever here plunge
the<00:05:34.889> thing<00:05:36.050> down<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:38.039> where<00:05:38.250> it's<00:05:38.460> on<00:05:38.729> the

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
the thing down to where it's on the

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.110 
the thing down to where it's on the
turret<00:05:39.330> now<00:05:40.080> my<00:05:40.379> router<00:05:40.830> bit<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.939> probably

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
turret now my router bit you probably

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.290 
turret now my router bit you probably
can't<00:05:42.539> see<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.779> on<00:05:42.899> the<00:05:42.990> camera<00:05:43.199> slightly

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
can't see it on the camera slightly

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.189 
can't see it on the camera slightly
protrude<00:05:45.300> slightly<00:05:45.629> below<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.229> base<00:05:48.500> get<00:05:49.500> my

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
protrude slightly below the base get my

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.170 
protrude slightly below the base get my
ear<00:05:52.199> protection<00:05:52.710> on<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:56.580> we're<00:05:56.699> going<00:05:56.879> to<00:05:56.939> try

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
ear protection on and we're going to try

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:15.900 
ear protection on and we're going to try
to<00:05:57.240> wrap<00:05:57.479> this<00:05:57.689> groove

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:27.150 

okay<00:06:16.910> let's<00:06:17.180> see<00:06:17.420> how<00:06:17.570> we<00:06:17.630> did<00:06:24.070> actually<00:06:25.330> the

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
okay let's see how we did actually the

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.880 
okay let's see how we did actually the
banning<00:06:28.160> is<00:06:28.340> slightly<00:06:28.910> wider<00:06:29.380> than<00:06:30.380> my<00:06:30.590> router

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
banning is slightly wider than my router

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:37.060 
banning is slightly wider than my router
bit<00:06:32.680> which<00:06:33.680> is<00:06:33.890> not<00:06:34.160> a<00:06:34.190> problem<00:06:35.260> so<00:06:36.260> I<00:06:36.590> need<00:06:36.920> to

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
bit which is not a problem so I need to

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.590 
bit which is not a problem so I need to
route<00:06:37.250> that<00:06:37.280> groove<00:06:37.820> a<00:06:37.940> little<00:06:37.970> bit<00:06:38.240> higher

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
route that groove a little bit higher

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.920 
route that groove a little bit higher
I'm<00:06:38.960> going<00:06:39.260> to<00:06:39.440> put<00:06:39.770> a<00:06:40.120> little<00:06:41.120> bit<00:06:41.270> of<00:06:41.390> masking

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
I'm going to put a little bit of masking

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:49.840 
I'm going to put a little bit of masking
tape<00:06:41.960> I<00:06:43.210> think<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:45.700> onto<00:06:46.700> my<00:06:46.850> fence<00:06:48.340> so<00:06:49.340> that<00:06:49.670> my

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
tape I think to onto my fence so that my

00:06:49.850 --> 00:07:10.450 
tape I think to onto my fence so that my
groove<00:06:50.120> will<00:06:50.300> get<00:06:50.450> a<00:06:50.480> little<00:06:50.780> wider

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.660 

perfect

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
perfect

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.530 
perfect
now<00:07:12.660> the<00:07:12.720> banding<00:07:13.350> is<00:07:13.700> you<00:07:14.700> can't<00:07:14.970> see<00:07:15.240> it<00:07:15.390> on

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
now the banding is you can't see it on

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.420 
now the banding is you can't see it on
there<00:07:15.750> but<00:07:15.930> it's<00:07:16.110> sticking<00:07:16.590> up<00:07:16.770> slightly

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
there but it's sticking up slightly

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.410 
there but it's sticking up slightly
higher<00:07:17.670> than<00:07:18.150> the<00:07:18.840> groove<00:07:19.250> that<00:07:20.250> I<00:07:20.280> routed<00:07:20.670> so

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
higher than the groove that I routed so

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.120 
higher than the groove that I routed so
now<00:07:21.600> when<00:07:21.780> I<00:07:21.810> glue<00:07:22.080> this<00:07:22.290> banding<00:07:22.800> in<00:07:22.920> there

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
now when I glue this banding in there

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.160 
now when I glue this banding in there
I'll<00:07:23.430> be<00:07:23.790> able<00:07:23.820> to<00:07:24.030> sand<00:07:24.450> it<00:07:24.540> flush<00:07:24.660> with<00:07:25.050> the

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.170 
I'll be able to sand it flush with the

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.590 
I'll be able to sand it flush with the
surface<00:07:25.350> and<00:07:26.190> that's<00:07:26.340> how<00:07:26.520> I<00:07:26.550> use<00:07:26.940> it<00:07:26.970> with<00:07:27.480> the

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
surface and that's how I use it with the

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.790 
surface and that's how I use it with the
LA<00:07:27.900> and<00:07:28.560> I<00:07:29.840> like<00:07:30.840> it<00:07:31.490> that's<00:07:32.490> it
