flange<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.690> fender<00:01:33.020> well<00:01:33.170> here<00:01:33.440> slide<00:01:33.860> the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
flange of the fender well here slide the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.980 
flange of the fender well here slide the
cross<00:01:34.190> members<00:01:34.580> through<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.000> way<00:01:35.149> or<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:35.960> can

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
cross members through that way or we can

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.469 
cross members through that way or we can
go<00:01:36.289> ahead<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.470> loosen<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.950> bed<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.430> lift<00:01:38.360> up

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
go ahead and loosen the bed and lift up

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.060 
go ahead and loosen the bed and lift up
on<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.720> bed<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:38.930> slide<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> cross<00:01:39.740> members

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
on the bed and slide the cross members

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.440 
on the bed and slide the cross members
in<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.729> think<00:01:40.910> that's<00:01:41.030> actually<00:01:41.210> we're

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
in and I think that's actually we're

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.730 
in and I think that's actually we're
going<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.720> on<00:01:41.899> this<00:01:41.990> installation<00:01:42.320> here

either way you want to make sure you go

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.969 
either way you want to make sure you go
ahead<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.509> lower<00:01:44.869> down<00:01:44.959> the<00:01:45.560> protective

the side and has multiple holes here at

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.620 
the side and has multiple holes here at
the<00:02:18.470> top<00:02:18.680> whereas<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.489> rear<00:02:19.640> crossmember<00:02:19.940> has

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the top whereas the rear crossmember has

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.900 
the top whereas the rear crossmember has
two<00:02:20.870> elongated<00:02:21.349> slots<00:02:21.739> at<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> top<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.819> then

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
two elongated slots at the top and then

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.270 
two elongated slots at the top and then
to<00:02:23.120> carriage<00:02:23.450> bolt<00:02:23.690> holes<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.500> sides<00:02:24.709> it's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
to carriage bolt holes on the sides it's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.130 
to carriage bolt holes on the sides it's
a<00:02:25.310> good<00:02:25.400> idea<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.700> go<00:02:25.849> ahead<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.120> take<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.510> run

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
a good idea to go ahead and take and run

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.380 
a good idea to go ahead and take and run
the<00:02:27.349> nuts<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.370> off<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> threads<00:02:29.209> here

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the nuts on and off of the threads here

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.910 
the nuts on and off of the threads here
at<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.569> end<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.810> couple<00:02:30.050> times<00:02:30.260> these<00:02:30.709> are

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
at the end a couple times these are

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.740 
at the end a couple times these are
painted<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.700> lot<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:31.849> times<00:02:32.090> they're<00:02:32.300> kind

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
painted and a lot of times they're kind

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.330 
painted and a lot of times they're kind
of<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> pain<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.170> get<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> nuts<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.310> a

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
of a pain to get the nuts on so it's a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.280 
of a pain to get the nuts on so it's a
good<00:02:34.430> idea<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.730> do<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> few<00:02:34.970> times

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
good idea to do it a few times

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.089 
good idea to do it a few times
independent<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.470> being<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> vehicle

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
independent of it being on the vehicle

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.100 
independent of it being on the vehicle
and<00:02:37.819> prior<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.360> installing<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.900> rear

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
and prior to installing the rear

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.270 
and prior to installing the rear
crossmember<00:02:39.380> I'm<00:02:39.830> going<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.130> ahead<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
crossmember I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.009 
crossmember I'm going to go ahead and
actually<00:02:40.519> put<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> carriage<00:02:41.060> bolts<00:02:41.330> in<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
actually put the carriage bolts in to

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.460 
actually put the carriage bolts in to
the<00:02:42.140> upper<00:02:42.350> holes<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.160> elongated<00:02:43.640> holes<00:02:43.850> a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
the upper holes the elongated holes a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.509 
the upper holes the elongated holes a
little<00:02:45.470> bit<00:02:45.560> easier<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.860> do<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.130> outside<00:02:46.280> of

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
little bit easier to do it outside of

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.100 
little bit easier to do it outside of
the<00:02:46.670> vehicle<00:02:46.850> them<00:02:47.150> then<00:02:47.450> try<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.750> do<00:02:47.870> once

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
the vehicle them then try to do once

they're in position with them in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.759 
they're in position with them in
position<00:02:56.569> we<00:02:56.630> just<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> slide<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.319> rear
