00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.890
 at my dad's butcher's desk 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.779
 really chicken sausages 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.370
 inviting and appetizing and tasty 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.710
 especially with less fat than 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.929
 the traditional prepared classics 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 one hundred percent with pork 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 then I have some classics I am on 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.150
 butcher counter why not try 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.250
 prepare them at home so I tried 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.930
 some experiment some formulation 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.760
 I must not say that the Eni 67 are not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 came bad and today I am here to 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.599
 give you the recipe too 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.510
 let's see how to prepare them to prepare 6 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.640
 chicken sausages we need 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.840
 300 g of very minced chicken breast 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.219
 finely 100 g of pancetta a slice 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 of garlic salt and pepper spice like pleasure 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 for example a teaspoon of aromas for 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.430
 roast a pinch of cinnamon and one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.870
 grated nutmeg 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 then guys we said that for 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 preparing to be efficient serves 300 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.559
 g of chicken breast I made 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 grind very very finely in mine 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.530
 butcher dad and a piece of bacon 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.870
 fresh which will be the only fat part 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 of our recipe so that if 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.810
 the need for chicken and if you look in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.049
 contraction all have a part of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 25 percent bacon it is anyway 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.130
 a lot of fat we say a lot 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.659
 lower than the traditional ones if 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.780
 it is prepared entirely with meat of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.820
 pig we put back inside one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.670
 pebbles I also put on gloves a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 roma we give you with me I took the mixes of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:35.150
 spices for roasts a bit of cinnamon not 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.150
 too much and nutmeg 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.860
 then we adjust the salt and put it there 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.920
 Also a bit of garlic, you can use 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.450
 the ju in powder or fresh live that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.480
 I'm going to crush just when it disappeared 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.900
 admiral and now we work well 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.610
 all with our own hands we grind 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.930
 with our hands we work everything after having 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.060
 all well mixed 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.010
 ingredients in I'm also going 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.050
 slap and meat to amalgamate them 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.020
 even better and also to avoid it 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.690
 stick this technique everywhere with me 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.660
 he taught it to Pope then we divide 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.120
 the compound in six parts hope 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.640
 we share interest and then take the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 half so we make 6 sausages more or 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.150
 less equal 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.480
 now we make from every bit 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.210
 we make a cylinder we do not work with 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.350
 hands and then we prepare sheets of 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.350
 transparent film 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.540
 here they are our beautiful sausages 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.550
 now to give him the form what 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.110
 we have prepared as I told you 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.970
 first a sheet of transparent film 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.370
 let's put them in the same way is not a strange life 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.920
 nor do we roll it up so badly 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.980
 we tighten and we also help each other 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.260
 beautiful perfect shape 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.250
 the company is ready let's do the same 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.250
 what also with the others 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.720
 here are our bagged recipes 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.210
 now you have two to cook 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.040
 possibility or boil them in this case 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.410
 you can the rooms directly with the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.970
 film for about 10 minutes and vi 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.740
 I show cooking in the pan that 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.410
 it's much simpler and also quick 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.780
 we heated a pan 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.420
 now let's unroll this time 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.280
 the sausages you see have also taken 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.680
 a beautiful shape and let's go directly 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.060
 in the pan without adding seasoning 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.459
 because we already have bacon 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:52.070
 inside no it will give the right 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:54.770
 consistency is also just fat if it 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.360
 we also lose the other we put in 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.360
 also the other france in the city 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.240
 we maintain a sustained flame though 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.860
 about 2 3 minutes turning them often then 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.120
 let 's put the lid on 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.120
 cooking for another two three minutes 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.630
 eh yes the homemade chicken sausages 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.579
 are proposes an excellent second course 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.739
 which I accompanied with a mix of 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.720
 vegetables and also as a little sauce 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.340
 mustard for storage then 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.110
 you can put it in the fridge with the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.360
 film and will last you perfectly 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.700
 for two or three days maximum if you want 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.560
 try conservation and put them in 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.030
 freezer with a freezer and they will be 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.389
 perfect even for two months 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.389
 enjoy your meal
