mistake because they've done it all

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.370 
mistake because they've done it all

that<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.290> parent<00:03:07.680> should<00:03:07.740> make<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> decision<00:03:08.490> as

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that a parent should make a decision as

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
it is graphic and the thing is at

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.100 
it is graphic and the thing is at
fourteen<00:03:14.070> your<00:03:15.000> daughter<00:03:15.240> knows<00:03:15.510> about<00:03:15.750> sex

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
fourteen your daughter knows about sex

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.530 
fourteen your daughter knows about sex
you<00:03:16.500> know<00:03:16.590> she's<00:03:16.860> aware<00:03:17.100> about<00:03:17.340> sex<00:03:17.700> hopefully

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you know she's aware about sex hopefully

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.480 
you know she's aware about sex hopefully
she's<00:03:18.780> educated<00:03:18.960> about<00:03:19.560> safe<00:03:19.830> sex<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.370> she's

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
she's educated about safe sex and she's

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.740 
she's educated about safe sex and she's
not<00:03:20.670> living<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.060> an<00:03:21.150> area<00:03:21.420> where<00:03:21.600> they're

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
not living in an area where they're

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.380 
not living in an area where they're
teaching<00:03:21.900> her<00:03:22.140> abstinence<00:03:22.620> only<00:03:22.710> education

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
teaching her abstinence only education

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.280 
teaching her abstinence only education
because<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.600> usually<00:03:24.780> gives<00:03:25.110> her

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
because that usually gives her

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.640 
because that usually gives her
misinformation<00:03:25.740> but<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:27.000> still<00:03:27.930> believe<00:03:27.990> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
misinformation but I still believe that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.470 
misinformation but I still believe that
a<00:03:28.680> parent<00:03:29.100> should<00:03:29.160> have<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.820> ability<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.240> make

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
a parent should have the ability to make
