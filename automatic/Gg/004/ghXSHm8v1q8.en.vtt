00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
a critical problem but just from

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
a critical problem but just from
aesthetic<00:01:53.820> standpoint<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.630> follows<00:01:55.170> me<00:01:55.200> just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
aesthetic standpoint it follows me just

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380

a<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:55.680> bit<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.759> everything<00:01:57.090> else<00:01:57.210> being

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a little bit with everything else being

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.149 
a little bit with everything else being
straight<00:01:57.630> lines<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.439> neat<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.920> just

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
straight lines and really neat it just

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.340 
straight lines and really neat it just
bumps<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.090> fairly<00:02:00.240> annoying<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
bumps up and this is fairly annoying the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.780 
bumps up and this is fairly annoying the
second<00:02:01.680> problem<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> elastic<00:02:02.579> wrap

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790

the<00:02:12.910> most<00:02:13.090> critical<00:02:13.330> problems<00:02:13.990> but<00:02:14.200> little

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
the most critical problems but little

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.690 
the most critical problems but little
nuances<00:02:14.770> here<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.130> there<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.430> thing<00:02:15.580> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
nuances here and there that thing you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.190 
nuances here and there that thing you
guys<00:02:15.850> should<00:02:16.120> know<00:02:16.240> about<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.780> lastly

guys should know about and lastly

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.780 
guys should know about and lastly
probably<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> main<00:02:17.890> point<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.250> contention<00:02:18.370> is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
probably the main point of contention is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.730 
probably the main point of contention is
you<00:02:19.000> actually<00:02:19.240> need<00:02:19.569> all<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.900> protection<00:02:20.380> it

as possible and I just don't believe

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.590 
as possible and I just don't believe
this<00:02:29.740> truly<00:02:29.980> hardly<00:02:30.550> fits<00:02:30.940> into<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.330> equation
