00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.349
 remembering that he missed three 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.939
 little heavy then you have to have a computer on the palms agreement 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.470

 strong maintained design said 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.750
 from the 7000 series up york 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.380
 play 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.850
 good first stirs polansky 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090
 revolting 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.460
 deposited under the areas 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.680
 or partizan 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 three types of assets 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.170
 so 64% is not known as what is difficult than any of them 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.660
 It's strange here. 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.220
 Another crime that I extracted ladybug in Iran 3 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.760
 so this is going to take a while because the teams are 34 years old 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 it will walk traditional bet that with the patient who finished the hertha with this 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.689
 Name quique already edu 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.840
 I grew up here every once in a while 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.299
 good 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.299
 As you said on the coast, you will see that you have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.900
 three files 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.420
 these two files down here want to gave me this kind of information are 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.700
 drawn before complement well 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.980
 the main file is the one here which is what has fritsch 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.580
 to live together 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.650
 you are seeing that these two of them have a single one clearly 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.100
 a record 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.040
 the iconia henrique promised the process I have 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.910
 I feel good here if it is not possible I did not come here 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.479
 that I'm using to immolate 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.000
 the game 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.880
 even though he played here so we could be doing this, "one of them said. 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.519
 need to burn the cd 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.689
 in the US this program is a cup with the site 20% in the sequence here 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.659
 This program that follows us in quiet bajaki today compensates and that 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.309
 this happens in the gogo but I recommend bajaki low 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.819
 he was not talking 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.769
 it's not for free 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.860
 of cannon I have not registered since the creation of the course 7 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.340
 20% and it's a great program for the same 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.970
 I was small the show that because the article will suppose that you are 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.239
 using 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:52.140
 promotion - we are with the saints the shadow a disk image 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 Of course you want to do maximum recording says it does still feel pain 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.189
 what felt of aesthetic creation recording which 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:06.859
 and here they work as follows, let's go there 20 and who comes here 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.529
 for the pontificate not his team 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.739
 currently 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.829

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.779
 both done it the three 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.369
 shortly after the closing of the event 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.789

 Marquis explains gates 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.830
 of traffic 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.379
 it's fun 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.789
 what I'm going to select 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.830
 you select so that it is valid for all users of the computer 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.220
 bridge 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.300
 only for you 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.210
 we have to stay here in the saints this is not a shortcut at this point 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.430
 kirk baxter 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.610
 here is high you can choose 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.039
 the folder 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.039
 click the commission outside the installation 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.110
 about the game 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.460
 very simple relax partner of all these steps here he will follow 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.270
 Calm down, do not stay here, there's nothing 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.889
 however that the same 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.889
 ansa 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.199
 So 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.779
 there is the tip of the year but the programmer like the 120% angola 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.780
 who helped you what I doubt you need 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.779
 any question same positioning 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.910
 do im 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.009
 there 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.720
 ask this left with a lot of people but a lot of people same are the same 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.909
 remembering the below 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.779
 Collor promised to help affirm but as situations click on the name in the elite the 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.779
 subject is in the left corner of the site 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.680
 in that same space 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.080
 So 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.240
 did not stop there until the next video - porto alegre 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.869
 there was a riot 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:29.999
 ae 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.210
 Do not forget that you participated as an extra 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.389
 the former agent there that I thrash him 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.860
 but it was not that helped a lot the rest I think is very cool 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.119

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.669
 that's just the family 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:00.689
 more winning
