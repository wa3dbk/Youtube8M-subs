how<00:02:23.390> many<00:02:23.600> calories<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.410> require<00:02:25.040> to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
how many calories you require to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.670 
how many calories you require to

maintain a stable and healthy weight for
both<00:02:28.460> sexes<00:02:29.090> there<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.750> general<00:02:30.290> guideline

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
both sexes there is a general guideline

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.700 
both sexes there is a general guideline
to<00:02:30.830> go<00:02:31.070> by<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:32.060> example<00:02:32.260> females<00:02:33.260> require

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
to go by for example females require

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.490 
to go by for example females require
approximately<00:02:34.450> 2,000<00:02:35.450> calories<00:02:35.930> on<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> daily

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
approximately 2,000 calories on a daily

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.400 
approximately 2,000 calories on a daily
basis<00:02:37.190> while<00:02:37.790> males<00:02:38.300> require<00:02:38.750> more<00:02:39.200> an

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
basis while males require more an

basis while males require more an
estimated<00:02:40.340> 2,500<00:02:41.209> calories<00:02:41.420> per<00:02:41.720> day<00:02:41.900> keep<00:02:42.860> in

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.430 
mind that other important considerations
are<00:02:45.560> your<00:02:46.190> build<00:02:46.580> your<00:02:47.180> height<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.660> how<00:02:48.170> much

are your build your height and how much

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.380 
are your build your height and how much
muscle<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.100> have<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.490> your<00:02:49.640> body<00:02:49.700> when<00:02:50.300> you

muscle you have on your body when you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.350 
muscle you have on your body when you
first<00:02:50.720> start<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.290> calorie<00:02:51.709> counting<00:02:52.310> plan

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.970 

once<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.840> figured<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.769> can

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
once you have this figured out you can

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
once you have this figured out you can
then<00:02:59.310> devise<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> plan<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.629> appropriate

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
then devise a plan that is appropriate

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.500 
then devise a plan that is appropriate
for<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.590> let's<00:03:02.340> look<00:03:02.640> at<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.879> concrete<00:03:03.180> example

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
for you let's look at a concrete example

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.040 
for you let's look at a concrete example
of<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.340> if<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.550> take<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.060> less<00:03:06.450> than<00:03:06.750> 500

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
of this if you take in less than 500

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.559 
of this if you take in less than 500
calories<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:08.040> what<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.400> require<00:03:08.849> on<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.239> daily

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
calories of what you require on a daily

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.630 
calories of what you require on a daily
basis<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.650> your<00:03:10.860> weight<00:03:11.069> loss<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.370> be

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
basis then your weight loss will be

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.710 
basis then your weight loss will be
roughly<00:03:12.060> one<00:03:12.599> pound<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.260> week<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:15.180> increase

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
roughly one pound a week if you increase

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.650 
roughly one pound a week if you increase
this<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.049> bringing<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.099> less<00:03:17.519> than<00:03:17.790> 1,000

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
this to bringing in less than 1,000

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.720 
this to bringing in less than 1,000
calories<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.980> will<00:03:20.129> lose<00:03:20.340> an<00:03:20.549> average

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
calories then you will lose an average

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.500 
calories then you will lose an average
of<00:03:21.030> two<00:03:21.090> pounds<00:03:21.840> weekly<00:03:22.290> sound<00:03:23.129> good

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.720 

why<00:03:27.510> does<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.840> work<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:28.290> well<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.430> want
