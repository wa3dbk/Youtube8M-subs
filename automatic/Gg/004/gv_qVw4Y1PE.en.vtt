00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
showing you how to use a ruler loop or

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.240 
showing you how to use a ruler loop or
loop<00:00:12.509> turner<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.009> looks<00:00:14.040> like

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
loop turner this is what one looks like

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.910 
loop turner this is what one looks like
it<00:00:17.250> has<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.420> hook<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> end<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it has a little hook on the end here a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.300 
it has a little hook on the end here a
little<00:00:20.789> latch<00:00:21.029> there<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.769> use<00:00:23.070> for

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
little latch there and this use for

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.230 
little latch there and this use for
turning<00:00:23.960> fabrics<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> right<00:00:26.250> side<00:00:26.580> so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
turning fabrics to the right side so

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.400 
turning fabrics to the right side so
we'll<00:00:27.359> show<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.310> strap<00:00:29.310> from

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
we'll show you with this strap from

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
we'll show you with this strap from
within<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> project<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> moment<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.450> it's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
within the project at the moment so it's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
within the project at the moment so it's
on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> wrong<00:00:33.870> side<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.670> put

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
on the wrong side as you can see you put

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.020 
on the wrong side as you can see you put
it<00:00:36.180> through<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:37.020> end<00:00:38.149> gather<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.390> onto<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it through one end gather it onto the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.389 
it through one end gather it onto the
actual<00:00:42.180> loop<00:00:42.510> itself<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> do

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
actual loop itself and then what you do

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.350 
actual loop itself and then what you do
then<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.750> catch<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:47.430> fabric<00:00:47.879> there

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.340 

like<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.550> then<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.910> bring<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:54.899> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
like so and then you bring it back in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.119 
like so and then you bring it back in
generally<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.690> tricky<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.559> start<00:00:58.980> off

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
generally it can be tricky to start off

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.640 
generally it can be tricky to start off
with<00:00:59.460> just<00:01:00.469> go<00:01:01.469> slowly<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.530> then<00:01:06.439> we'll<00:01:07.439> get

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
with just go slowly and then we'll get

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
with just go slowly and then we'll get
easier<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.729> along<00:01:08.850> everything<00:01:09.630> that's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
easier as you go along everything that's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
easier as you go along everything that's
going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.380> easier<00:01:10.770> yeah<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
going to be a bit more easier yeah I can

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.510 
going to be a bit more easier yeah I can
feel<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.200> pinch<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.890> edge<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
feel it now so just pinch the edge of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
feel it now so just pinch the edge of
the<00:01:14.700> raw<00:01:14.820> edge<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.630> gently<00:01:16.200> pull<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the raw edge and then gently pull it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.300 
the raw edge and then gently pull it
through<00:01:20.600> go<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> gathering<00:01:22.290> alone<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
through go to gathering alone and to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.800 
through go to gathering alone and to
here<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.700> must<00:01:24.479> come<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> end<00:01:25.320> where

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
here there must come it to the end where

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
here there must come it to the end where
yay<00:01:28.340> take<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> loop<00:01:29.670> Al's<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> fishing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
yay take the loop Al's like a fishing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.780 
yay take the loop Al's like a fishing
hook<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.720> there<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.930> go

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
hook and then there we go

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
hook and then there we go
it's<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:37.049> side<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's now on the right side and it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.490 
it's now on the right side and it
becomes<00:01:38.759> kind<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.439> tubular<00:01:40.700> if<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> word

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
becomes kind of tubular if that's a word

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.550 
becomes kind of tubular if that's a word
and<00:01:44.090> then<00:01:45.090> I'll<00:01:45.570> show<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.320> next

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and then I'll show you what to do next

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.069 
and then I'll show you what to do next
and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.610> order<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.450> seam<00:01:48.840> running

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and then in order to get seam running

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.179 
and then in order to get seam running
down<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.740> middle

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
down the middle

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.380 
down the middle
I<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.329> pins<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.380> every<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.939> often

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
I would put pins in every so so often

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.859 
I would put pins in every so so often
and<00:01:54.649> then<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.040> happen<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.299> them

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and then what will happen then is them

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.440 
and then what will happen then is them
as<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.829> iron<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.670> remove<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> pins

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
as you actually iron you remove the pins

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
as you actually iron you remove the pins
out<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.560> actually<00:02:01.860> line<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.549> solely

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
out as you actually line just solely

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.780 
out as you actually line just solely
helps<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.079> seam<00:02:04.590> inside<00:02:04.890> lying

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
helps you to get the seam inside lying

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.300 
helps you to get the seam inside lying
in<00:02:06.180> whatever<00:02:07.020> direction<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.160> my

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
in whatever direction you want it to my

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.420 
in whatever direction you want it to my
in<00:02:08.489> I've<00:02:09.149> got<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> seem<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.649> towards<00:02:11.160> me

in I've got it seem you know towards me

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.150 
in I've got it seem you know towards me
and<00:02:12.060> once<00:02:12.239> you've<00:02:12.420> done<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and once you've done that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.890 
and once you've done that
and<00:02:13.700> you've<00:02:13.970> pressed<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:17.660> what<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and you've pressed it that's what it

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.060 
and you've pressed it that's what it
looks<00:02:18.080> like

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.820
