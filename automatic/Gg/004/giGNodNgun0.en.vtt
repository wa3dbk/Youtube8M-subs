00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.360
 a robot wall-e in action it does not need a central computer to control 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.360
 and no human help 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.330
 los Angeles 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.610
 take care of the mind 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.659
 volume up 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.759
 local regulation so that this stops at more than total 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.490
 five workers are building the scientists 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.910
 these parts alone make way for a lot of effort and family 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.060
 The goal of the scientist is a robot of both in parts and in the whole 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.190
 is working 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.660
 the advantage that is possible that MÃ¼hren also changes his 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 Environment to respond 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990
 biological systems 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.000
 reach still person in certain areas becomes clear 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.400
 Robustness everything should 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.930
 At least once your company can hold a job entirely 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 special Heinemann strolled a bit so no longer stand 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.210
 Mill way be cleverer than other robots 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390
 his system is complicated 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.700
 That is why ten computer scientists produce the individual parts almost all themselves 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.710
 For a year, they have only developed schematics 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.690
 meanwhile, senior citizens work and screw together 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.960
 the advantage 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 the developers are flexible 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.200
 Lengerich Vossen has access to everything they do and many of them 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 Circuit-finding comedy still quickly fix itself 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 new things quickly a tree 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.690
 but fine and head to just lose everything 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.980
 with currently only program point 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.930
 Here, for example, motion sequences are optimized over the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.010
 Interplay of all body parts is the big challenge 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.110
 military 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560
 the intelligent behavior and body 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.950
 yes already in the small work must 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 as part of the handlebar with one leg 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.900
 and then later but if the robot with several parts percent 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.899
 Composite should then have to cooperate well 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.529
 Dylan has learned to see by now 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.999
 he recognizes objects based on the colors and shapes here he calls the red 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.999
 Targeting cards 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.919
 b 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.919
 and he looks for it when it's gone 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.329
 the scientists want even more 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 should learn by yourself 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.679
 Wesel 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.529
 we are not on application 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:55.949
 disconnected him so we do not want him to percent the first one out or drive 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.019
 the mines were looking for whatever else one hears 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.690
 we try to work more with the robot than with small children 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.849
 that solos interaction forms already machine and their such local Michel 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.849
 Investigate WiÃŸmann and then continue on average 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.769
 There are already robots operating machines and executing orders 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.159
 but to prevent re-election should respond to their environment 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.169
 and there the researchers in Berlin are at the beginning
