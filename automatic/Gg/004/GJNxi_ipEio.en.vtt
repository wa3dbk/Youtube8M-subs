00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120 
that something's going on you can keep
it<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.600> I'll<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.049> far<00:01:46.079> low<00:01:46.530> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it right here and I'll go so far low but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.819 
it right here and I'll go so far low but
the<00:01:47.250> idea<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.930> twist<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> there

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the idea is to get that twist in there

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.980 
the idea is to get that twist in there
to<00:01:50.070> work<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> middle<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> body<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to work the middle of the body then you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
to work the middle of the body then you
can<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.320> ahead<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.710> take<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> other

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
can go ahead and take it to the other

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.170 
can go ahead and take it to the other
side<00:01:54.740> keeping<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> bellybutton<00:01:56.460> always

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
side keeping the bellybutton always

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300 
side keeping the bellybutton always
steady<00:01:57.479> facing<00:01:58.079> front<00:01:58.380> keeping<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> Tuck

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
steady facing front keeping the Tuck

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.120 
steady facing front keeping the Tuck
before<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.750> you'll<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.200> very<00:02:01.590> strong

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
before you know it you'll be very strong

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
before you know it you'll be very strong
and<00:02:02.399> hopefully<00:02:03.180> you'll<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> coming<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:03.960> for

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and hopefully you'll be coming back for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.159 
and hopefully you'll be coming back for
more<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> soon
