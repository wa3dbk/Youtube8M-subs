about on this page because in reality

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
about on this page because in reality
manipulation<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> technicals<00:01:18.299> means<00:01:18.659> how

you're doing it what type of methods
math<00:01:22.680> calculations<00:01:23.670> formulas<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.780> you're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
math calculations formulas that you're

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.280 
math calculations formulas that you're
using<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.130> figure<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.570> things<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
using to figure out how to do things for

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.280 
using to figure out how to do things for
if<00:01:28.799> there's<00:01:28.979> manipulation<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> market<00:01:30.390> then

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
if there's manipulation in a market then

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.140 
if there's manipulation in a market then
the<00:01:31.380> technicals<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> tell<00:01:32.700> us<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the technicals are going to tell us that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270 
the technicals are going to tell us that
they<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.079> show<00:01:34.380> us<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.829> within<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
they will show us that within the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.789 
they will show us that within the
Fibonacci<00:01:35.970> within<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> moving<00:01:37.079> averages<00:01:37.740> or

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
Fibonacci within the moving averages or

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.880 
Fibonacci within the moving averages or
so<00:01:38.759> many<00:01:39.030> other<00:01:39.299> great<00:01:39.689> different<00:01:40.350> indicators

really good traders and they shorted
silver<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.579> gold<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.170> should<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.590> be

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
silver and gold then they should not be

going back to the 19th century when I
say<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.240> but<00:02:27.480> since<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.170> 1900s<00:02:29.480> then<00:02:30.480> we

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
say that but since the 1900s then we

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.440 
say that but since the 1900s then we
have<00:02:30.870> seen<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.790> seen<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
increase of gold go higher it's a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.990 
increase of gold go higher it's a

shows us the manipulation but if you're
watching<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.730> channel<00:03:18.180> or<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.690> all

the<00:03:19.110> others<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.560> manipulation<00:03:20.520> is

the others you know manipulation is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.199 
the others you know manipulation is
obviously<00:03:21.600> out<00:03:21.990> there<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.430> people<00:03:23.760> talk<00:03:24.180> about

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
obviously out there so people talk about

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.930 
obviously out there so people talk about
a<00:03:24.510> gold<00:03:24.810> bubble<00:03:25.320> well<00:03:25.770> gold<00:03:26.040> has<00:03:26.280> bubbled<00:03:26.790> in

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
a gold bubble well gold has bubbled in

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.790 
a gold bubble well gold has bubbled in
my<00:03:27.120> opinion<00:03:27.510> or<00:03:27.690> has<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> good<00:03:28.170> chance<00:03:28.470> but

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
my opinion or has a good chance but

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.340 
my opinion or has a good chance but
that's<00:03:29.220> priced<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.790> silver<00:03:30.330> towards<00:03:31.020> here

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
that's priced and silver towards here

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.160 
that's priced and silver towards here
even<00:03:32.190> though<00:03:32.340> i<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.520> it's<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.090> bubble<00:03:33.750> that

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
even though i think it's a bubble that

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.290 
even though i think it's a bubble that
means<00:03:34.560> gold<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.220> continue<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.730> go<00:03:35.850> higher

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
means gold would continue to go higher

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.690 
means gold would continue to go higher
when<00:03:36.990> gold<00:03:37.260> goes<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.650> five<00:03:37.860> thousand<00:03:38.430> dollars

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
when gold goes to five thousand dollars

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.960 
when gold goes to five thousand dollars
per<00:03:38.880> ounce<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.870> might<00:03:40.140> meet<00:03:40.410> silver<00:03:41.070> at<00:03:41.250> around

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
per ounce it might meet silver at around

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.140 
per ounce it might meet silver at around
a<00:03:42.239> hundred<00:03:42.630> or<00:03:43.170> two<00:03:43.860> hundred<00:03:43.970> dollars<00:03:44.970> per

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
a hundred or two hundred dollars per

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.930 
a hundred or two hundred dollars per
ounce<00:03:45.330> which<00:03:45.570> with<00:03:45.810> us<00:03:46.080> make<00:03:46.739> this<00:03:46.980> chart<00:03:47.520> go

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
ounce which with us make this chart go

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.170 
ounce which with us make this chart go
lower<00:03:48.630> right<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:49.739> on<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.010> chart<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:50.970> have

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
lower right now on this chart we have

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.990 
lower right now on this chart we have
this<00:03:51.330> pattern<00:03:51.900> where<00:03:52.380> we<00:03:52.500> move<00:03:52.770> higher<00:03:53.190> we

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
this pattern where we move higher we

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.180 
this pattern where we move higher we
come<00:03:54.300> back<00:03:54.480> down<00:03:54.840> towards<00:03:55.410> here<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.860> then

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
come back down towards here and then

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.720 
come back down towards here and then
have<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.360> little<00:03:57.600> bearish<00:03:58.440> flag<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.459> is

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
have this little bearish flag that is

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.660 
have this little bearish flag that is
obviously<00:04:00.330> breaking<00:04:00.959> down<00:04:01.230> since<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.070> is

managed to come back down to its
previous<00:04:05.130> level<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.300> support<00:04:06.780> if<00:04:07.410> we<00:04:08.310> take<00:04:08.940> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
previous level of support if we take a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.449 
previous level of support if we take a
look<00:04:09.120> at<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.480> from<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.840> bottom<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.830> will<00:04:11.250> say

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
look at this from the bottom of will say

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.699 
look at this from the bottom of will say
fifty<00:04:12.090> upwards<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.260> 88<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.420> some<00:04:15.709> fibonacci

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
fifty upwards to 88 on some fibonacci

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.789 
fifty upwards to 88 on some fibonacci
and<00:04:16.950> take<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> look<00:04:18.239> at<00:04:18.450> some<00:04:18.900> where<00:04:19.320> we<00:04:19.470> should

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and take a look at some where we should

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.159 
and take a look at some where we should
be<00:04:19.980> holding<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.860> 65<00:04:22.860> level<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.970> ratio<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.479> 65

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
be holding the 65 level the ratio of 65

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.290 
be holding the 65 level the ratio of 65
to<00:04:25.440> one<00:04:25.650> was<00:04:26.550> huge

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
to one was huge

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.360 
to one was huge
this<00:04:27.449> is<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.870> level<00:04:28.289> that<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.650> had<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.099> hold

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
this is the level that it had to hold

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.580 
this is the level that it had to hold
the<00:04:29.909> technicals<00:04:30.509> are<00:04:30.629> telling<00:04:31.020> us<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.169> this

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
the technicals are telling us that this

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.240 
the technicals are telling us that this
move<00:04:32.009> higher<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.639> becoming<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.740> failed

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
move higher is becoming that of a failed

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.779 
move higher is becoming that of a failed
move<00:04:35.909> you<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:37.020> also<00:04:37.169> make<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> case<00:04:37.919> that<00:04:37.949> we

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
move you can also make a case that we

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.110 
move you can also make a case that we
have<00:04:39.030> what<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.569> a<00:04:39.599> technical<00:04:40.199> term<00:04:40.229> of<00:04:40.680> a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
have what is a technical term of a

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.240 
have what is a technical term of a
inverted<00:04:42.120> cup<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.659> handle<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.099> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
inverted cup and handle this is the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.520 
inverted cup and handle this is the
pattern<00:04:44.490> here<00:04:44.940> basically<00:04:45.479> what<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.229> means

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
pattern here basically what this means

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.890 
pattern here basically what this means
is<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.860> have<00:04:47.039> your<00:04:47.220> rally<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.879> then<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.599> have

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
is you have your rally and then you have

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.230 
is you have your rally and then you have
a<00:04:48.930> significant<00:04:49.770> setup<00:04:50.129> which<00:04:50.340> we<00:04:50.520> did<00:04:50.759> you

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
a significant setup which we did you

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.719 
a significant setup which we did you
have<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> shorter<00:04:52.259> rally<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.889> then<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.490> come

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
have a shorter rally and then you come

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.710 
have a shorter rally and then you come
back<00:04:53.759> down<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.780> its<00:04:54.900> previous<00:04:55.199> support<00:04:55.590> level

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
back down to its previous support level

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.580 
back down to its previous support level
therefore<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> range<00:04:58.650> of<00:04:59.060> 6288<00:05:00.060> if<00:05:00.539> we<00:05:01.110> use<00:05:01.319> the

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
therefore a range of 6288 if we use the

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.209 
therefore a range of 6288 if we use the
same<00:05:02.159> Fibonacci<00:05:02.909> calculator<00:05:03.539> would<00:05:04.379> give<00:05:05.009> us

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
same Fibonacci calculator would give us

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.390 
same Fibonacci calculator would give us
a<00:05:05.430> price<00:05:06.000> objective<00:05:06.330> for<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.229> number<00:05:07.800> objective

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
a price objective for a number objective

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.279 
a price objective for a number objective
to<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.639> downside<00:05:08.909> of<00:05:10.310> 47<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.969> third<00:05:12.509> to<00:05:13.020> one

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
to the downside of 47 and a third to one

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.520 
to the downside of 47 and a third to one
as<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:14.310> next<00:05:14.879> level<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.509> support<00:05:15.810> which

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
as the next level of support which

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.920 
as the next level of support which
ironically<00:05:17.009> meets<00:05:17.729> up<00:05:17.969> with<00:05:18.030> these<00:05:18.449> levels

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
ironically meets up with these levels

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.550 
ironically meets up with these levels
from<00:05:19.729> 2006<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:24.080> 2007<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.199> that<00:05:25.349> was<00:05:25.469> an

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
from 2006 and 2007 and that was an

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.709 
from 2006 and 2007 and that was an
interesting<00:05:25.800> little<00:05:26.129> picture<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.669> sure<00:05:26.909> many

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
interesting little picture of sure many

interesting little picture of sure many
of<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.930> may<00:05:28.229> have<00:05:28.259> figured<00:05:29.069> that<00:05:29.250> out<00:05:29.400> however

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
of you may have figured that out however

the<00:05:30.770> charts<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:32.130> itself<00:05:32.669> it's<00:05:33.120> looking<00:05:33.810> to

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
the charts in itself it's looking to

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.659 
the charts in itself it's looking to
continue<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.190> go<00:05:35.310> lower<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:37.099> trend<00:05:38.099> line<00:05:38.159> that

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
continue to go lower the trend line that

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.540 
continue to go lower the trend line that
would<00:05:38.819> be<00:05:38.969> of<00:05:39.090> importance<00:05:39.659> right<00:05:40.289> now<00:05:40.560> that's

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
would be of importance right now that's

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.730 
would be of importance right now that's
I'd<00:05:42.000> have<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> go<00:05:42.449> with<00:05:42.479> this<00:05:42.960> one<00:05:43.020> in<00:05:43.380> here<00:05:43.590> it

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
I'd have to go with this one in here it

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.920 
I'd have to go with this one in here it
connects<00:05:44.099> a<00:05:44.699> few<00:05:45.569> key<00:05:46.139> solid<00:05:46.770> points<00:05:47.719> now<00:05:48.719> but

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
connects a few key solid points now but

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.010 
connects a few key solid points now but
nonetheless<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:50.250> movements<00:05:51.210> right<00:05:51.419> now<00:05:51.630> is

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
nonetheless the movements right now is

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.809 
nonetheless the movements right now is
for<00:05:54.169> continued<00:05:55.169> downside<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:56.129> looks<00:05:56.400> like<00:05:56.639> web

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
for continued downside it looks like web

it's<00:06:00.090> going<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.659> 121<00:06:01.379> not<00:06:01.590> only<00:06:01.770> that<00:06:01.860> my

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
it's going to 121 not only that my

it's going to 121 not only that my
long-term<00:06:02.789> predictions<00:06:03.150> is<00:06:03.900> for<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:05.069> gold

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
long-term predictions is for the gold

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.730

and<00:06:05.400> silver<00:06:05.789> ratio<00:06:06.180> over<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:06.690> many<00:06:06.810> decades<00:06:07.379> to

and silver ratio over so many decades to

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.409

go<00:06:08.270> 0.1<00:06:09.270> or<00:06:09.539> 0.3<00:06:10.409> to<00:06:10.740> one<00:06:11.039> but<00:06:11.940> this<00:06:12.060> is<00:06:12.240> what

go 0.1 or 0.3 to one but this is what
