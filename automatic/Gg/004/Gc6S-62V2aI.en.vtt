configuration see there and that stud
configuration<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.769> little<00:02:53.099> different

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
configuration is just a little different

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.699 
configuration is just a little different
here<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.629> circle<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:56.329> straight

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
here you have the circle a straight

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.270 
here you have the circle a straight
horizontal<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.459> then<00:03:00.530> yeah<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.829> little

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
horizontal and then yeah a little

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.759 
horizontal and then yeah a little
different<00:03:03.440> doesn't<00:03:04.440> really<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.709> a

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
different doesn't really make a

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.550 
different doesn't really make a
difference<00:03:05.069> but<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:09.109> lightness<00:03:10.109> really<00:03:10.379> does

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
difference but the lightness really does

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.099 
difference but the lightness really does
so<00:03:11.489> pretty<00:03:11.700> much<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.060> only<00:03:12.109> difference

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
so pretty much the only difference

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.520 
so pretty much the only difference
between<00:03:13.290> these<00:03:13.650> two<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:15.349> sole<00:03:16.349> plate

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
between these two is the sole plate

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.650 
between these two is the sole plate
because<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.340> stud<00:03:17.670> conversion<00:03:18.120> ation<00:03:18.419> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
because the stud conversion ation and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.789 
because the stud conversion ation and
carbon<00:03:19.019> fiber<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.849> end<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.299> here<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.870> two

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
carbon fiber so end up here we have two

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.670 
carbon fiber so end up here we have two
