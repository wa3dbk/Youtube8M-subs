well<00:00:02.520> here's<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.030> latest<00:00:03.210> update<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.870> where

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
well here's the latest update on where

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.190 
well here's the latest update on where
we're<00:00:04.259> at<00:00:04.380> with<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.089> shoreland<00:00:06.089> when<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.080> do

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
we're at with the shoreland when I do

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.180 
we're at with the shoreland when I do
live<00:00:08.059> I've<00:00:09.059> left<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.050> tailstock<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
live I've left the tailstock for the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.090 
live I've left the tailstock for the
moment<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.700> gone<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.660> top<00:00:13.080> slide<00:00:16.100> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
moment have gone on to the top slide and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.599 
moment have gone on to the top slide and
I<00:00:17.430> pull<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> top<00:00:18.510> slide<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> cross<00:00:20.250> slide

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
I pull the top slide in the cross slide

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.250 
I pull the top slide in the cross slide
part<00:00:21.199> here's<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.439> cross<00:00:22.650> slide<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.960> slides

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
part here's the cross slide the slides

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.930 
part here's the cross slide the slides
actually<00:00:26.000> not<00:00:27.000> too<00:00:27.180> bad<00:00:29.210> as<00:00:30.210> far<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:32.180> make<00:00:33.180> sure

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
actually not too bad as far as make sure

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.639 
actually not too bad as far as make sure
movement<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> dovetails

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
movement and that I think the dovetails

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.959 
movement and that I think the dovetails
would<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.100> okay<00:00:38.629> there's<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:40.079> slop<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.860> I

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.490 

think<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> thread<00:00:45.870> block<00:00:46.760> which<00:00:48.350> yet<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
think in the thread block which yet to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.330 
think in the thread block which yet to
investigate<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.879> play<00:00:51.949> do<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> wobble

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
investigate it's not in play do a wobble

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.930 
investigate it's not in play do a wobble
in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> handle<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:55.070> I'm<00:00:56.070> thinking<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in the handle so I'm thinking that the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.869 
in the handle so I'm thinking that the
thread<00:00:57.180> block<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> might<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.410> worn<00:00:58.879> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
thread block on this might be worn the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.830 
thread block on this might be worn the
other<00:01:00.680> top<00:01:01.680> slide<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.370> thread<00:01:03.300> block<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
other top slide the thread block out of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
other top slide the thread block out of
that<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> actually<00:01:04.580> extremely<00:01:05.580> good<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.750> looks

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that is actually extremely good it looks

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
that is actually extremely good it looks
like<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.170> been<00:01:07.260> replaced<00:01:07.590> probably<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.549> think

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
like it's been replaced probably I think

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.950 
like it's been replaced probably I think
this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.049> fairly<00:01:10.049> new<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:12.030> eliminated

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this is a fairly new one I eliminated

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
this is a fairly new one I eliminated
the<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:15.150> end<00:01:15.330> slot<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.960> had<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.570> in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the the end slot that I had in the in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.890 
the the end slot that I had in the in
the<00:01:18.780> shaft<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.130> basically<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:21.000> where

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the shaft it was basically just a where

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.429 
the shaft it was basically just a where
that<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> adjuster<00:01:23.810> couldn't<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that the adjuster couldn't take up so I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
that the adjuster couldn't take up so I
made<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.920> young<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.490> spacer<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.900> there

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
made up a young a spacer to go in there

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.600 
made up a young a spacer to go in there
and<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.229> eliminated<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.310> play

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and that's eliminated all the in play

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.050 
and that's eliminated all the in play
and<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:34.430> all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> backlash<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and that so the all the backlash is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.010 
and that so the all the backlash is
basically<00:01:37.049> gone<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.220> top<00:01:38.909> slide<00:01:39.210> top

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
basically gone from the top slide top

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.450 
basically gone from the top slide top
slide<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.650> course<00:01:40.680> does<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
slide on this of course does all the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.130 
slide on this of course does all the
work<00:01:41.490> basically<00:01:44.390> everything<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> pretty<00:01:46.049> much

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
work basically everything is pretty much

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.920 
work basically everything is pretty much
done<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.649> top<00:01:46.829> slide<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.220> these<00:01:47.399> lathes

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
done with the top slide on these lathes

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.950 
done with the top slide on these lathes
now<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> top<00:01:49.439> slide<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.630> very<00:01:51.630> badly

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
now the top slide that was very badly

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
now the top slide that was very badly
worn<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.649> dovetails<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
worn on the on the the dovetails and the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.719 
worn on the on the the dovetails and the
flats<00:01:57.200> very<00:01:58.200> badly<00:01:58.530> worn<00:01:58.829> worn<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> point

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
flats very badly worn worn to the point

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
flats very badly worn worn to the point
that<00:02:00.530> if<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.770> Gibbs<00:02:02.040> were<00:02:02.369> adjusted<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.710> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that if the Gibbs were adjusted up so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
that if the Gibbs were adjusted up so
that<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.130> reasonably<00:02:05.490> tight<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:06.210> he

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that it was reasonably tight here he

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.780 
that it was reasonably tight here he
would<00:02:07.110> only<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.860> back<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
would only go back on the on the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.290 
would only go back on the on the
compound<00:02:12.270> base

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
compound base

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.650 
compound base
it<00:02:13.480> would<00:02:13.660> only<00:02:13.810> go<00:02:14.140> back<00:02:14.410> about<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.910> third<00:02:16.420> of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
it would only go back about a third of

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.810 
it would only go back about a third of
the<00:02:16.810> way<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.270> full<00:02:19.450> cable<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:21.460> was<00:02:21.640> that

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
the way on the full cable it was that

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.280 
the way on the full cable it was that
badly<00:02:22.150> worn<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:24.160> spent<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.820> afternoon<00:02:25.290> with

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
badly worn so I spent the afternoon with

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.710 
badly worn so I spent the afternoon with
my<00:02:26.530> file<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.550> why<00:02:29.340> prussian<00:02:30.340> blue<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.240> my

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
my file and why prussian blue and my

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:41.490 
my file and why prussian blue and my
stool<00:02:32.080> roller<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.860> my<00:02:38.370> round<00:02:39.870> drill<00:02:40.870> bits<00:02:41.110> to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
stool roller and my round drill bits to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800 
stool roller and my round drill bits to
measure<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.520> scrape<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> slides<00:02:43.450> down

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
measure it and I scrape the slides down

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.260 
measure it and I scrape the slides down
and<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:45.520> duck<00:02:45.730> tail<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:47.350> now<00:02:48.270> pretty

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
and the duck tail and it's now pretty

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.190 
and the duck tail and it's now pretty
good<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:51.060> little<00:02:52.060> way<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.240> go<00:02:52.450> with<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.660> yet<00:02:52.870> but

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
good a little way to go with it yet but

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.190 
good a little way to go with it yet but
it's<00:02:53.650> very<00:02:54.160> close<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.230> put<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:59.250> compound<00:03:00.250> on

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it's very close if I put the compound on

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.260 
it's very close if I put the compound on
it's<00:03:02.200> firm<00:03:02.860> all<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> way<00:03:03.490> oh<00:03:03.570> it's<00:03:04.570> good

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
it's firm all the way oh it's good

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.460 
it's firm all the way oh it's good
that's<00:03:07.270> really<00:03:07.690> not<00:03:07.840> too<00:03:08.050> bad<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.260> only<00:03:11.350> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that's really not too bad so it's only a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.920 
that's really not too bad so it's only a
tiny<00:03:11.710> bit<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.220> do<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.580> 100%<00:03:18.930> but

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
tiny bit to do just to get it 100% but

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.520 
tiny bit to do just to get it 100% but
that<00:03:20.050> will<00:03:20.170> be<00:03:20.200> perfect<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.380> all

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
that will be perfect so it's all

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.949 
that will be perfect so it's all
recoverable<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.730> matter<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.090> put<00:03:25.930> a

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
recoverable it's just a matter of put a

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.070 
recoverable it's just a matter of put a
bit<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.140> effort<00:03:26.470> into<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:27.810> mean<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:28.959> got

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
bit of effort into it I mean it's got

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.770 
bit of effort into it I mean it's got
some<00:03:29.110> shoe<00:03:29.500> marks<00:03:29.860> here<00:03:30.100> but<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.489> mean<00:03:30.780> being

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
some shoe marks here but I mean being

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.400 
some shoe marks here but I mean being
old<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.709> never<00:03:32.830> going<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.130> eliminate<00:03:33.520> that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
old you never going to eliminate that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.900 
old you never going to eliminate that
those<00:03:35.410> marks<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.280> leave<00:03:36.489> them<00:03:36.670> they<00:03:36.760> had<00:03:36.880> a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
those marks just leave them they had a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.560 
those marks just leave them they had a
bit<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.090> character<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.570> suppose<00:03:42.420> there's<00:03:43.420> a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
bit of character I suppose there's a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.220 
bit of character I suppose there's a
locking<00:03:43.780> bolt<00:03:44.140> goes<00:03:44.380> through<00:03:44.680> here<00:03:45.070> with<00:03:45.820> a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
locking bolt goes through here with a

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.530 
locking bolt goes through here with a
pull<00:03:47.230> down<00:03:50.100> circular<00:03:51.100> plug<00:03:51.610> which<00:03:52.060> basically

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
pull down circular plug which basically

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.520 
pull down circular plug which basically
locks<00:03:53.020> that<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.900> screw<00:03:56.860> for<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.310> hand<00:03:58.090> wheel

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
locks that the screw for the hand wheel

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.750 
locks that the screw for the hand wheel
that<00:03:59.530> goes<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.980> street<00:04:00.100> block<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.550> locks

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
that goes to the street block it locks

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.410 
that goes to the street block it locks
that<00:04:00.910> in<00:04:01.060> place<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.750> was<00:04:01.900> missing<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.209> made

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
that in place that was missing so I made

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.229 
that in place that was missing so I made
one<00:04:04.570> of<00:04:04.660> those<00:04:04.750> up<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:05.940> turned<00:04:06.940> out<00:04:07.090> quite

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
one of those up and turned out quite

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.370 
one of those up and turned out quite
nicely<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:09.420> I'll<00:04:10.420> finish<00:04:10.630> up<00:04:10.780> painting<00:04:11.080> that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
nicely and I'll finish up painting that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.960 
nicely and I'll finish up painting that
put<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.800> bit<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.040> filler<00:04:12.190> in<00:04:12.340> there<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:12.730> overall

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
put a bit of filler in there but overall

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.690 
put a bit of filler in there but overall
is<00:04:13.090> pretty<00:04:13.269> good<00:04:13.450> but<00:04:13.840> yeah<00:04:14.019> so<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:15.400> has<00:04:15.550> come

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
is pretty good but yeah so this has come

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.910 
is pretty good but yeah so this has come
up<00:04:16.019> excellent<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.630> really<00:04:19.989> good

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.230 

and<00:04:23.920> she'll<00:04:24.220> be<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:24.460> about<00:04:24.700> as<00:04:24.760> good<00:04:24.880> as<00:04:25.090> new

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
and she'll be just about as good as new

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.400 
and she'll be just about as good as new
when<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.480> get<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.780> finished

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
when I get it finished

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.050 
when I get it finished
I<00:04:26.470> started<00:04:26.890> accuracy<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.370> should<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:27.700> spot-on

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
I started accuracy it should be spot-on

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.710 
I started accuracy it should be spot-on
so<00:04:28.480> um<00:04:29.310> even<00:04:30.310> though<00:04:30.370> it's<00:04:30.520> 90<00:04:30.790> years<00:04:30.970> old<00:04:31.210> got

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
so um even though it's 90 years old got

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.240 
so um even though it's 90 years old got
plenty<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.050> life<00:04:32.200> left<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.770> yet

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
plenty of life left in it yet

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.670 
plenty of life left in it yet
a<00:04:33.840> little<00:04:34.840> bit<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.050> effort<00:04:36.660> yeah<00:04:37.680> everything

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
a little bit of effort yeah everything

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.950 
a little bit of effort yeah everything
you<00:04:38.770> do
