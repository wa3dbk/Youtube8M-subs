00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.880
 I'll talk about the new plantronics voyager 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.030
 gucci new headset product of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.220
 famous Californian company this new 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.980

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.279
 voyager pro hd for those who do n't know the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.010
 pronto knicks is a very famous company 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 American Californian taking that height 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.099
 mainly produces accessories for the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 business communication 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 but in this last period he has decided 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 also to expand the market on 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 medium to high average consumer users 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 level however because the price anyway 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
 of these earphones always wanders 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.559
 around 100 euros 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.120
 certainly for those of you who have worked 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.360
 in a call center that knows them from 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.739
 plantronics as almost all of them 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.700
 call center headphones on a product from 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.399
 this company 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.079
 the new headset produced by a 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 plantronics and reduces the weight by 30 per 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 one hundred compared to the previous voyager 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.290
 pro hd well inserted three microphones which 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.610
 allow practically the reduction of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.280
 noise to a minimum 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.320
 and it is also 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.860
 has been improved in water resistance and 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.140
 therefore safer to any splashes 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.790
 accidental inside the package 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.940
 as you have seen your day of 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.210
 boxing you will find the headset when 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.770
 his box a charger e 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.500
 a classic desktop charger 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.899
 taken both American and Italian and the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 replacement headphones but let's get started right away 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.600
 with headset then as you can see 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.750
 this return is completely done 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 very comfortable rubber is very light 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.929
 then the microphone is articulated so it can 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.850
 be used both on the ear 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.440
 right than on the left ear without 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.569
 no slightest problem 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 a very interesting thing could 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.080
 test these days and the sensor of 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.420
 proximity that has been entered 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.069
 inside thanks to this sensor one 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.369
 time our headset connected 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.470
 on the phone he automatically recognizes 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.660
 to six and on our ear or on 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.730
 table I did several tests without 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.400
 earphone is resting on the table 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.769
 call diverted automatically 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.019
 to the phone speaker when we 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.820
 take the earpiece and take it 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.680
 we wear the ear of the ear 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.739
 a few milliseconds the call comes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.690
 turned automatically and the earpiece la 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.120
 same thing applies to reproductions of 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.579
 music being played 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.440
 if we remove a headset and go to 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.220
 automatically stop playback 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.700
 the same thing also happens on pc in 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.239
 how much thanks to this convenient pen 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.579
 bluetooth 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.209
 we can go to install the 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:53.970
 our headset and use it for sui 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.140
 most common software like skype 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.910
 I have similar programs for example 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.280
 used for more than eight hours a day in 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.200
 office with a corporate voip system e 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.580
 have not encountered any problems if 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.110
 tests were immediately recognized 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.780
 made the quality was decidedly 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.680
 better all the noise was removed 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.810
 in the background 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.030
 so clear on the other side he felt 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.060
 mainly just my voice e 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.220
 he did not hear other disturbances in the distance 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 I can say that after these two weeks 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.470
 almost test this headset 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.740
 it really surprised me a lot when 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 also how long the battery life is 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.750
 over 10 hours of earphone only 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.600
 there is the station that charging that 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.360
 allows two additional recharges 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.250
 definitely in the coming weeks 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.650
 contain your found on my blog 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.330
 some interesting articles on this 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.720
 to repair as I am still 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.280
 calmly testing all applications 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.440
 which released plantronics then 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.550
 those for android iphone and also for 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.100
 computer 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.640
