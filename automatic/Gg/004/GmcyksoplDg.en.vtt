00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:34.650 

you

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:01:37.200 

you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.270 

so<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.930> way<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.170> one<00:01:38.409> starts<00:01:38.590> off<00:01:39.040> with<00:01:39.220> a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
so the way this one starts off with a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.180 
so the way this one starts off with a
pretty<00:01:39.549> simple<00:01:39.880> clock<00:01:40.510> like<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.049> it's<00:01:41.979> a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
pretty simple clock like this it's a

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.880 
pretty simple clock like this it's a
fill<00:01:42.430> clock<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.270> will<00:01:44.110> fill<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.500> area

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
fill clock so it will fill this area

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.000 
fill clock so it will fill this area
with<00:01:45.159> redstone<00:01:46.150> blocks<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.990> an<00:01:47.110> air<00:01:47.440> every

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
with redstone blocks and an air every

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.640 
with redstone blocks and an air every
tick<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.150> all<00:01:49.570> these<00:01:49.780> command<00:01:50.170> blocks<00:01:50.440> are

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
tick so all these command blocks are

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.950 
tick so all these command blocks are
being<00:01:50.890> powered<00:01:51.280> every<00:01:51.670> single<00:01:52.030> tick<00:01:52.299> we<00:01:52.810> also

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
being powered every single tick we also

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.440 
being powered every single tick we also
have<00:01:53.170> an<00:01:53.619> objective<00:01:54.040> for<00:01:54.430> every<00:01:54.790> block<00:01:55.060> which

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
have an objective for every block which

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.760 
have an objective for every block which
is<00:01:55.479> just<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.170> stat<00:01:56.470> dot<00:01:56.740> mind<00:01:57.100> block<00:01:57.490> dot

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
is just the stat dot mind block dot

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.730 
is just the stat dot mind block dot
minecraft<00:01:59.770> ah<00:02:00.040> whatever<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.970> block<00:02:01.210> ID<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.840> so

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
minecraft ah whatever the block ID is so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.130 
minecraft ah whatever the block ID is so
for<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.040> one<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:03.430> stone<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.600> every<00:02:04.990> time

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
for this one it's stone and every time

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.740 
for this one it's stone and every time
you<00:02:05.200> mind<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.649> block<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.100> goes<00:02:06.340> up<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.540> once

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
you mind the block it goes up so once

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.779 
you mind the block it goes up so once
you've<00:02:07.930> mined<00:02:08.200> one<00:02:08.500> block<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.100> will<00:02:09.429> get<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
you've mined one block you will get the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.000 
you've mined one block you will get the
slowness<00:02:10.179> effect<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.260> makes<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.620> seem<00:02:11.800> like

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
slowness effect so it makes it seem like

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.550 
slowness effect so it makes it seem like
you're<00:02:12.250> carrying<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.940> block<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.560> will

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you're carrying the block and you will

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.979 
you're carrying the block and you will
also<00:02:14.739> get<00:02:15.160> mining<00:02:16.060> fatigue<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.870> you

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
also get mining fatigue so that you

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.910 
also get mining fatigue so that you
can't<00:02:17.260> mine<00:02:17.500> another<00:02:18.010> block<00:02:19.350> also<00:02:20.350> we<00:02:20.650> have<00:02:20.800> an

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
can't mine another block also we have an

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.340 
can't mine another block also we have an
execute<00:02:21.400> command<00:02:21.760> which<00:02:22.180> summons<00:02:22.690> falling

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
execute command which summons falling

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.550 
execute command which summons falling
sand<00:02:23.709> at<00:02:24.070> your<00:02:24.340> location<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:26.050> has<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
sand at your location and it has the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.840 
sand at your location and it has the
block<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.600> idea<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.640> block<00:02:30.640> that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
block and the idea of the block that

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.479 
block and the idea of the block that
you've<00:02:31.060> mined<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.980> stone

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
you've mined so for this one it's stone

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.300 
you've mined so for this one it's stone
and<00:02:35.310> also<00:02:36.310> by<00:02:36.550> default<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:38.110> have<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:38.830> time

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and also by default you have this time

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.340 
and also by default you have this time
equals<00:02:39.760> zero<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.780> don't<00:02:40.930> need<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.080> put<00:02:41.320> that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
equals zero you don't need to put that

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.949 
equals zero you don't need to put that
because<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.329> kind<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
because that's the kind of like the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.979 
because that's the kind of like the
default<00:02:44.410> for<00:02:44.680> falling<00:02:45.040> sand<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:46.239> that's

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
default for falling sand but that's

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.500 
default for falling sand but that's
basically<00:02:47.470> what<00:02:47.769> makes<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.160> work<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.700> that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
basically what makes this work is that

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.620 
basically what makes this work is that
the<00:02:49.720> sand<00:02:49.959> has<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> time<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.890> zero<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.610> once<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
the sand has a time of zero so once the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.960 
the sand has a time of zero so once the
spawns<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.230> will<00:02:53.350> despawn<00:02:53.980> after<00:02:54.549> one<00:02:54.730> tick

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
spawns it will despawn after one tick

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.270 
spawns it will despawn after one tick
and<00:02:55.269> that's<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.440> makes<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.890> seem<00:02:57.130> like

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
and that's what makes it seem like

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.340 
and that's what makes it seem like
you're<00:02:57.459> constantly<00:02:58.000> holding<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.600> because

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
you're constantly holding it because

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.930 
you're constantly holding it because
this<00:02:59.500> command<00:02:59.890> block<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.250> being<00:03:00.549> executed

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
this command block is being executed

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.750 
this command block is being executed
every<00:03:01.570> tick<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:02.769> also<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.250> command<00:03:03.640> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
every tick we also have a command that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.420 
every tick we also have a command that
will<00:03:04.030> set<00:03:04.480> your<00:03:04.630> score<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.739> block<00:03:06.010> that

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
will set your score of the block that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.420 
will set your score of the block that
you<00:03:06.640> mind<00:03:07.049> 20<00:03:08.049> once<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.709> looking

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
you mind 20 once you are looking

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.060 
you mind 20 once you are looking
straight<00:03:09.670> down<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.720> once<00:03:10.930> your<00:03:11.140> score<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
straight down so once your score of the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.009 
straight down so once your score of the
block<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.640> set<00:03:13.510> back<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.989> 0<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:15.250> will<00:03:15.870> clear<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
block is set back to 0 it will clear the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.960 
block is set back to 0 it will clear the
effects<00:03:17.410> from<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.799> which<00:03:18.070> are<00:03:18.310> slowness<00:03:18.820> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
effects from you which are slowness and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.810 
effects from you which are slowness and
mining<00:03:19.239> fatigue<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:20.650> will<00:03:20.829> also<00:03:21.010> execute

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
mining fatigue and it will also execute

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.270 
mining fatigue and it will also execute
a<00:03:21.940> set<00:03:22.180> block<00:03:22.420> command<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.410> block<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:24.040> your

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
a set block command of the block of your

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.539 
a set block command of the block of your
choice<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.480> for<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:25.750> one<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:27.010> places<00:03:27.519> a

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
choice so for this one it just places a

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.099 
choice so for this one it just places a
stone<00:03:27.880> block<00:03:28.150> where<00:03:28.450> your<00:03:28.630> feet<00:03:29.590> are<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
stone block where your feet are and

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.509 
stone block where your feet are and
makes<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.260> seem<00:03:32.470> like<00:03:32.620> you're<00:03:32.829> placing<00:03:33.130> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
makes it seem like you're placing the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.020 
makes it seem like you're placing the
block<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:35.049> once<00:03:35.440> I'm<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.010> block<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.850> will

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
block so once I'm on the block this will

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.120 
block so once I'm on the block this will
turn<00:03:37.239> off<00:03:37.480> which<00:03:37.959> means<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.440> i'm<00:03:38.739> holding

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
turn off which means that i'm holding

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.110
