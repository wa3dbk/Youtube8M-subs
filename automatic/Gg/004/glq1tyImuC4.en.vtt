I<00:01:24.400> miss<00:01:25.400> which<00:01:25.550> angle<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.030> guys<00:01:26.150> can<00:01:26.300> see

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
I miss which angle so you guys can see

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:57.060 
I miss which angle so you guys can see
what<00:01:26.570> I'm<00:01:26.630> doing

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.770 

this<00:01:57.640> way<00:01:57.790> don't<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.060> bring<00:01:58.210> any<00:01:58.360> special

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
this way don't to bring any special

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:09.260 
this way don't to bring any special
equipment<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.290> with<00:01:59.440> you<00:02:04.950> keep<00:02:05.950> your<00:02:06.070> kit<00:02:06.280> down

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.210 

now<00:02:10.270> this<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.509> green<00:02:10.780> grass<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:12.010> really

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
now this is green grass so it's really

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550 
now this is green grass so it's really
flexible<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.230> careful<00:02:14.500> about

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
flexible so I to be careful about

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.630 
flexible so I to be careful about
overloading<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.220> too<00:02:15.340> much<00:02:15.459> weight<00:02:17.640> with

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
overloading with too much weight with

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.250 
overloading with too much weight with
the<00:02:18.880> other<00:02:19.180> grinds<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> breeze<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.140> I'm

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the other grinds of the breeze that I'm

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.080 
the other grinds of the breeze that I'm
filtering<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.800> best<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.250> use<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
filtering out but the best is to use the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.290 
filtering out but the best is to use the
yellow<00:02:25.270> straw<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:26.110> grass<00:02:27.660> where<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
yellow straw like grass where it's a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.130 
yellow straw like grass where it's a
like<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> dry<00:02:31.630> husk<00:02:31.900> ammos<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.870> stuffs

like a dry husk ammos the stuffs

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.240 
like a dry husk ammos the stuffs
phenomenal<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.040> because<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.700> really
