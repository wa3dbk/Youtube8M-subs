00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
works great so that that's what I do but

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.770 
works great so that that's what I do but
before<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> was<00:04:28.320> prescribed<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.950> um<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:30.300> if

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
before I was prescribed and um and if

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.879 
before I was prescribed and um and if
you<00:04:30.900> want<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.110> do<00:04:31.200> that<00:04:31.320> that's<00:04:31.530> awesome

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
you want to do that that's awesome

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.080 
you want to do that that's awesome
because<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.280> think<00:04:32.430> there's<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.610> stigma<00:04:32.669> run

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
because I think there's a stigma run

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.879 
because I think there's a stigma run
being<00:04:33.300> medicated<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.960> think<00:04:34.200> it's<00:04:34.320> silly

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
being medicated and I think it's silly

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.980 
being medicated and I think it's silly
if<00:04:35.130> I'm<00:04:35.250> being<00:04:35.370> honest<00:04:35.669> um<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.600> mean<00:04:36.870> obviously

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
if I'm being honest um I mean obviously

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.870 
if I'm being honest um I mean obviously
think<00:04:37.530> nobody<00:04:37.980> should<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.220> over<00:04:38.400> medicated

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
think nobody should be over medicated

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.350 
think nobody should be over medicated
and<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.389> not<00:04:39.600> good<00:04:39.810> good<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.800> over<00:04:40.980> medicate

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
and it's not good good to over medicate

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.879 
and it's not good good to over medicate
but<00:04:42.360> some<00:04:42.570> people<00:04:42.840> truly<00:04:43.110> can't<00:04:43.440> sleep<00:04:43.680> and
