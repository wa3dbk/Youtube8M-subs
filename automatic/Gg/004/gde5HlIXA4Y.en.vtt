00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
cuz I like it better than my other ones

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
cuz I like it better than my other ones
this<00:02:42.900> was<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.290> old<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.280> I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
this was my old there this is what I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.090 
this was my old there this is what I
started<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.880> out<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.350> like<00:02:46.350> my<00:02:46.530> very<00:02:46.800> first

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
started it out with like my very first

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100 
started it out with like my very first
time<00:02:47.220> drawing<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> character<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.960> it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
time drawing the character and then it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.680 
time drawing the character and then it
evolved<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.380> looks<00:02:52.410> better

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
evolved that so I think it looks better

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.080 
evolved that so I think it looks better
or<00:02:54.690> what<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.140> has<00:02:55.290> become<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.460> turned

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
or what it has become I think it turned

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.470 
or what it has become I think it turned
out<00:02:57.530> pretty<00:02:58.530> sweet<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.280> yeah<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.180> canvas
