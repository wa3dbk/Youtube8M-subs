00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
hits me again so he does go for the ice

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.560 
hits me again so he does go for the ice
beam<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.829> I'm<00:01:46.009> going<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:47.179> go<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
beam and I'm going to just go for the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.910 
beam and I'm going to just go for the
slack<00:01:47.810> off<00:01:48.049> knowing<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:48.619> he's<00:01:48.740> going<00:01:48.859> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
slack off knowing that he's going to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.919 
slack off knowing that he's going to
kill<00:01:49.130> him<00:01:49.250> also<00:01:49.369> himself<00:01:49.939> off<00:01:50.329> from<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.719> burn

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
kill him also himself off from the burn

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.029 
kill him also himself off from the burn
and<00:01:52.179> if<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.749> hit<00:01:54.170> him<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.679> would<00:01:54.890> have<00:01:54.979> been

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
and if I hit him it would have been

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.739 
and if I hit him it would have been
useless<00:01:55.369> because<00:01:57.939> he<00:01:58.939> was<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> cub<00:01:59.299> himself<00:01:59.630> off

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
useless because he was a cub himself off

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.870 
useless because he was a cub himself off
so<00:02:00.530> he's<00:02:00.679> going<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.859> go<00:02:00.979> for<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.310> turn<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.640> stay

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
so he's going to go for you turn I stay

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.059 
so he's going to go for you turn I stay
in<00:02:02.090> knowing<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.479> can<00:02:02.810> live<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.049> specs<00:02:03.799> track

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
switch out due to the lights green or

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.540 
switch out due to the lights green or
aid<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:10.930> dark<00:02:11.930> pools<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.650> he's<00:02:12.890> going<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.069> turn

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
aid a dark pools so he's going to turn

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.840 
aid a dark pools so he's going to turn
out<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.850> jirachi<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.260> sound<00:02:15.950> or<00:02:16.220> satin

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
out to a jirachi and that sound or satin

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.120 
out to a jirachi and that sound or satin
Dora<00:02:17.170> isn't<00:02:18.170> really<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.440> threatening<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.980> me

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
Dora isn't really that threatening to me

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.890 
Dora isn't really that threatening to me
because<00:02:19.340> he<00:02:19.850> does<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.420> u-turn

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
because he does have the u-turn

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.080 
because he does have the u-turn
so<00:02:21.260> things<00:02:22.099> are<00:02:22.220> looking<00:02:22.250> pretty<00:02:22.549> good<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:22.819> me

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so things are looking pretty good for me

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.140 
so things are looking pretty good for me
and<00:02:23.299> he<00:02:24.049> shows<00:02:24.319> me<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.680> he's<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:25.220> self-locking

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and he shows me that he's a self-locking

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.270 
and he shows me that he's a self-locking
jirachi<00:02:26.890> left<00:02:27.890> over<00:02:28.189> so<00:02:29.799> I'm<00:02:30.799> pretty<00:02:30.980> sure<00:02:31.189> he

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
jirachi left over so I'm pretty sure he

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.920 
jirachi left over so I'm pretty sure he
doesn't<00:02:31.400> carry<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.000> coma<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.480> Thunderbolt

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
doesn't carry the coma and Thunderbolt

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.690 
doesn't carry the coma and Thunderbolt
combination<00:02:33.709> which<00:02:33.890> would<00:02:34.189> really<00:02:34.579> suck

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
combination which would really suck

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.910 
combination which would really suck
against<00:02:35.329> my<00:02:35.420> slowbro<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.590> I'm<00:02:36.709> gonna<00:02:36.829> just

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
against my slowbro so I'm gonna just

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.750 
against my slowbro so I'm gonna just
stay<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.489> he<00:02:37.760> goes<00:02:37.879> for<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.120> wish<00:02:38.420> which<00:02:39.760> really

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
stay in he goes for a wish which really

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.819 
stay in he goes for a wish which really
helps<00:02:41.060> me<00:02:41.090> out<00:02:41.180> because<00:02:41.450> he<00:02:41.780> only<00:02:41.930> has<00:02:42.170> two

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
helps me out because he only has two

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.530 
helps me out because he only has two

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
feeling that he has a special move that

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.420

he can hit me with but shows me that his

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.300 
he can hit me with but shows me that his
last<00:03:10.579> move<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:10.879> on<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.209> wave<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:11.950> just<00:03:12.950> going<00:03:13.069> to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
last move is on a wave so just going to

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.089 
last move is on a wave so just going to
stay<00:03:13.879> in<00:03:14.049> go<00:03:15.049> for<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.290> boiling<00:03:15.560> water<00:03:15.590> try<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
stay in go for the boiling water try to

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.530 
stay in go for the boiling water try to
get<00:03:16.250> some<00:03:16.400> hacks<00:03:16.609> on<00:03:16.819> him<00:03:16.970> but<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.209> get

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
get some hacks on him but I get

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.819 
get some hacks on him but I get
paralyzed<00:03:18.019> though<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.500> doesn't<00:03:18.650> really

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
paralyzed though it doesn't really

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.270 
paralyzed though it doesn't really
matter<00:03:19.069> because<00:03:20.470> if<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.620> didn't<00:03:21.859> get<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.069> burn

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
matter because if I didn't get the burn

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.339 
matter because if I didn't get the burn
it<00:03:22.430> would<00:03:22.549> have<00:03:22.639> been<00:03:22.700> useless<00:03:23.000> regardless<00:03:23.659> so

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
it would have been useless regardless so

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.099 
it would have been useless regardless so
I<00:03:24.379> do<00:03:24.709> get<00:03:25.220> paralyzed<00:03:25.669> here<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.389> that<00:03:26.810> kind<00:03:27.079> of

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
I do get paralyzed here and that kind of

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.140 
I do get paralyzed here and that kind of
sucks<00:03:27.319> but<00:03:27.560> at<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.190> same<00:03:28.370> time<00:03:28.579> if<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.879> didn't

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
sucks but at the same time if I didn't

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.000 
sucks but at the same time if I didn't
get<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.359> Bernie<00:03:29.569> his<00:03:30.079> miss<00:03:30.500> Maggie's<00:03:30.829> would

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
get the Bernie his miss Maggie's would

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.490 
get the Bernie his miss Maggie's would
be<00:03:31.129> a<00:03:31.160> full<00:03:31.370> health<00:03:31.549> regardless<00:03:32.109> so<00:03:33.109> he's

amount<00:05:46.640> of<00:05:46.760> damage<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.770> subtle<00:05:48.770> could<00:05:48.919> take

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
amount of damage a subtle could take

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.730 
amount of damage a subtle could take
that<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.310> lot<00:05:49.610> better<00:05:49.850> but<00:05:50.840> that<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.229> a<00:05:51.260> lie

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
that a lot better but that is a lie

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.980 
that a lot better but that is a lie
formed<00:05:52.340> haunch<00:05:52.760> crow<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:54.669> yeah<00:05:55.669> so<00:05:56.660> he's<00:05:56.840> gonna

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
formed haunch crow so yeah so he's gonna

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.770 
formed haunch crow so yeah so he's gonna
get<00:05:57.380> tapped<00:05:57.590> by<00:05:57.770> Lee<00:05:57.950> seed<00:05:58.220> and<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.970> switch<00:05:59.570> out

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
get tapped by Lee seed and I switch out

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.940 
get tapped by Lee seed and I switch out
thinking<00:06:00.229> I<00:06:00.320> just<00:06:00.470> going<00:06:00.560> to<00:06:00.650> go<00:06:00.740> for<00:06:00.860> another

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
thinking I just going to go for another

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.230 
thinking I just going to go for another
brave<00:06:01.340> bird<00:06:01.669> but<00:06:02.000> he<00:06:02.360> makes<00:06:02.570> a<00:06:02.690> great<00:06:03.940> move<00:06:04.940> and

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
brave bird but he makes a great move and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.000 
brave bird but he makes a great move and
goes<00:06:05.360> for<00:06:05.390> the<00:06:05.810> pursuit<00:06:06.260> and<00:06:06.530> he<00:06:06.710> gets<00:06:06.890> the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
goes for the pursuit and he gets the

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.969 
goes for the pursuit and he gets the
overconfidence<00:06:07.370> boots<00:06:07.910> but<00:06:08.120> luckily<00:06:08.330> for<00:06:08.630> me

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
overconfidence boots but luckily for me

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.880 
overconfidence boots but luckily for me
all<00:06:09.979> this<00:06:10.160> residual<00:06:10.640> damage<00:06:11.440> means<00:06:12.440> that<00:06:12.740> he

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
all this residual damage means that he

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.529 
all this residual damage means that he
three-hit<00:06:13.310> basically<00:06:13.970> three<00:06:14.180> he<00:06:14.270> kills

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
three-hit basically three he kills

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.200 
three-hit basically three he kills
himself<00:06:15.400> so<00:06:16.400> you're<00:06:16.520> gonna<00:06:16.610> go<00:06:16.789> for<00:06:16.940> a<00:06:16.970> brave

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
himself so you're gonna go for a brave

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.870 
himself so you're gonna go for a brave
bird<00:06:17.450> right<00:06:17.630> here<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.760> with<00:06:19.760> the

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
bird right here and with the

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.880 
bird right here and with the
overconfidence<00:06:20.210> because<00:06:20.810> he's<00:06:20.960> gonna<00:06:21.200> take

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
overconfidence because he's gonna take

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.650 
overconfidence because he's gonna take
enough<00:06:22.100> from<00:06:22.220> recoil<00:06:22.700> and<00:06:22.940> kill<00:06:23.210> himself<00:06:23.330> off

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
enough from recoil and kill himself off

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.250 
enough from recoil and kill himself off
so<00:06:24.160> he'd<00:06:25.160> go<00:06:25.400> kill<00:06:25.880> himself<00:06:26.030> basically<00:06:26.390> so<00:06:26.930> I

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
so he'd go kill himself basically so I

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.930 
so he'd go kill himself basically so I
went<00:06:27.590> for<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.830> crunch<00:06:28.180> just<00:06:29.180> in<00:06:29.270> case<00:06:30.039> how<00:06:31.039> the

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
went for the crunch just in case how the

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.430 
went for the crunch just in case how the
residual<00:06:32.510> damage<00:06:32.600> didn't<00:06:32.960> finish<00:06:33.080> them<00:06:33.289> off

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
residual damage didn't finish them off

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.260 
residual damage didn't finish them off
so<00:06:34.250> he's<00:06:34.400> going<00:06:34.520> to<00:06:34.580> go<00:06:34.700> for<00:06:34.850> the<00:06:34.880> iron<00:06:35.150> hand

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
so he's going to go for the iron hand

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.730 
so he's going to go for the iron hand
I'm<00:06:35.419> gonna<00:06:35.570> have<00:06:35.660> to<00:06:35.720> sacrifice<00:06:35.900> my<00:06:36.320> turrets
