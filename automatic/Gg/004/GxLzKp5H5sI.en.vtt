00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
the bases let's just go through this

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:45.710 
the bases let's just go through this
real<00:03:27.090> quick

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.190 

so<00:03:46.290> again<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.590> has<00:03:46.770> dual<00:03:47.040> cameras<00:03:48.020> let<00:03:49.020> me

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
so again this has dual cameras let me

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.380 
so again this has dual cameras let me
make<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.350> pixel<00:03:49.740> front<00:03:49.920> web<00:03:50.190> camera<00:03:50.610> which<00:03:51.270> is

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
make a pixel front web camera which is

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.560 
make a pixel front web camera which is
here<00:03:51.540> at<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> top<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.050> screen<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:54.330> rear

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
here at the top of the screen the rear

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.770 
here at the top of the screen the rear
is<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> 2<00:03:55.500> megapixels<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:59.510> see<00:04:00.510> if<00:04:00.630> there's

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
is a 2 megapixels and see if there's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.740 
is a 2 megapixels and see if there's
anything<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.170> comes<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.770> see<00:04:07.950> good

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
anything that comes you can see good

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.050 
anything that comes you can see good
this<00:04:09.750> has<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.960> wide<00:04:10.170> viewing<00:04:10.440> angle<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.940> can

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
this has a wide viewing angle you can

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.150 
this has a wide viewing angle you can
still<00:04:12.300> see<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.630> genie<00:04:13.170> map<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:19.230> speakers

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
still see the genie map and the speakers

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.289 
still see the genie map and the speakers
on<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.370> back<00:04:20.519> it's<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.910> can<00:04:21.030> hear<00:04:21.090> it's

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
on the back it's you can hear it's

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.930 
on the back it's you can hear it's
really<00:04:21.390> valid<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:23.130> volume<00:04:23.430> up<00:04:23.550> button<00:04:23.580> is

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
really valid the volume up button is

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.280 
really valid the volume up button is
here<00:04:26.360> really<00:04:27.360> high-quality<00:04:27.540> speaker<00:04:28.080> there

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.680 

so<00:04:32.960> yeah<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.700> hopefully<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> should

so supports flash 11.1 that's 5-point

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.159 
so supports flash 11.1 that's 5-point
multi-touch<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.680> can<00:05:20.770> see<00:05:21.069> they're<00:05:22.169> really

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
multi-touch you can see they're really

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.439 
multi-touch you can see they're really
responsive<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:27.060> we're<00:05:28.060> going<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.240> do<00:05:28.360> is

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
responsive and we're going to do is

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.529 
responsive and we're going to do is
prime<00:05:28.720> now<00:05:29.099> so<00:05:30.099> let's<00:05:30.340> do<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.699> search<00:05:31.000> for<00:05:31.060> this

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
prime now so let's do a search for this

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:50.210 
prime now so let's do a search for this
baby<00:05:34.080> then<00:05:35.080> why<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:40.620> d90<00:05:43.080> pearl<00:05:44.080> all<00:05:44.979> one<00:05:45.370> word

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:39.570 
pixel resolution on a 50 degree viewing
angle<00:06:36.120> so<00:06:37.120> yeah<00:06:37.330> this<00:06:37.570> is<00:06:38.500> not<00:06:38.830> IPS<00:06:39.280> it's<00:06:39.430> only

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.700 
angle so yeah this is not IPS it's only
capacitive<00:06:40.180> but<00:06:40.810> as<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.199> can<00:06:41.320> see<00:06:41.500> I<00:06:41.530> just

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
capacitive but as you can see I just

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.110 
capacitive but as you can see I just
going<00:06:41.919> to<00:06:41.979> show<00:06:42.099> you<00:06:42.190> the<00:06:42.340> wide<00:06:42.490> viewing<00:06:42.759> angle

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
going to show you the wide viewing angle

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.409 
going to show you the wide viewing angle
and<00:06:43.740> it's<00:06:44.740> very<00:06:45.039> responsive<00:06:47.789> 7000<00:06:48.789> on<00:06:49.000> battery

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
and it's very responsive 7000 on battery

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.839 
and it's very responsive 7000 on battery
so<00:06:49.750> that<00:06:49.900> should<00:06:50.080> be<00:06:50.139> good<00:06:50.289> for<00:06:50.349> 78<00:06:50.979> hours<00:06:53.849> the

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
so that should be good for 78 hours the

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.249 
so that should be good for 78 hours the
languages<00:06:55.479> so<00:06:55.630> which<00:06:55.719> we<00:06:55.870> kind<00:06:56.080> of<00:06:56.110> already

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
languages so which we kind of already

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.600 
languages so which we kind of already
went<00:06:56.530> through<00:06:57.360> and<00:06:58.889> it's<00:06:59.889> ten<00:07:00.099> point<00:07:00.340> five

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
went through and it's ten point five

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.879 
went through and it's ten point five
millimeters<00:07:01.180> thick<00:07:01.979> that's<00:07:02.979> pretty<00:07:03.190> thin

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:16.839 

and<00:07:11.139> turn<00:07:12.139> that<00:07:12.169> around<00:07:12.409> and<00:07:15.400> if<00:07:16.400> you<00:07:16.550> add<00:07:16.699> it

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849 
and turn that around and if you add it

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:25.119 
and turn that around and if you add it
to<00:07:17.060> the<00:07:17.240> cart<00:07:23.199> see<00:07:24.199> what<00:07:24.349> the<00:07:24.439> price<00:07:24.650> comes<00:07:24.889> out

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:25.129 
to the cart see what the price comes out

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.760 
to the cart see what the price comes out
so<00:07:25.370> this<00:07:25.610> should<00:07:25.789> be<00:07:25.819> a<00:07:25.909> discount<00:07:26.529> so<00:07:27.529> there<00:07:27.680> is

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
so this should be a discount so there is

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.089 
so this should be a discount so there is
a<00:07:27.800> discount<00:07:28.219> is<00:07:28.370> a<00:07:28.430> dollar<00:07:28.610> fifty<00:07:28.909> discount<00:07:30.099> so

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:31.099 
a discount is a dollar fifty discount so

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:34.510 
a discount is a dollar fifty discount so
comes<00:07:31.370> out<00:07:31.550> to<00:07:31.789> 178<00:07:32.389> 49<00:07:33.129> you<00:07:34.129> can<00:07:34.249> tell<00:07:34.370> you<00:07:34.460> out

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
comes out to 178 49 you can tell you out
