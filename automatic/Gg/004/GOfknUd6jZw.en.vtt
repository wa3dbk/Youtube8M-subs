fun i use one of the teams i got from

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.660 
fun i use one of the teams i got from
NBC<00:00:09.660> through<00:00:10.019> skype<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.559> while<00:00:10.769> ago<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.370> it's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
NBC through skype a while ago and it's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.209 
NBC through skype a while ago and it's
working<00:00:12.179> out<00:00:12.240> fabulous<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.139> game<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
working out fabulous in this game so I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.240 
working out fabulous in this game so I
lead<00:00:14.730> off<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.389> deoxys<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.379> thus<00:00:16.500> deoxys

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
lead off with my deoxys and thus deoxys

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.450 
lead off with my deoxys and thus deoxys
carries<00:00:18.240> dual<00:00:18.690> screens<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.560> he<00:00:19.859> leads<00:00:20.100> off<00:00:20.310> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
carries dual screens and he leads off of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.160 
carries dual screens and he leads off of
groudon<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.090> I'm<00:00:21.180> thinking<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.630> groudon

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
groudon so I'm thinking this groudon

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.130 
groudon so I'm thinking this groudon
probably<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:22.980> stealth<00:00:23.460> rocks<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.480> something

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
probably has stealth rocks and something

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.560 
probably has stealth rocks and something
of<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.289> nature<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.250> he<00:00:26.849> carries<00:00:27.210> thunder

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
of that nature and he carries thunder

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.830 
of that nature and he carries thunder
wave<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.140> he's<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.310> offensive<00:00:30.300> variance

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
wave so he's not an offensive variance

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.139 
wave so he's not an offensive variance
so<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.320> thinking<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:31.920> good<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.340> now<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
so I'm thinking I'm good right now but I

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.080 
so I'm thinking I'm good right now but I
know<00:00:33.540> he's<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> carry<00:00:35.090> offensive

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
know he's going to carry offensive

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.520 
know he's going to carry offensive
physical<00:00:36.750> moves<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:39.079> decided<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.320> for

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
physical moves so I decided to go for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.670 
physical moves so I decided to go for
reflect<00:00:41.010> first<00:00:41.600> because<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.960> he<00:00:43.079> decides<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
reflect first because if he decides it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.920 
reflect first because if he decides it
hit<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.219> gonna<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> no<00:00:45.450> damage

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
hit me it's gonna do little to no damage

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
hit me it's gonna do little to no damage
at<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.420> case

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
at all as you can see for in this case

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
at all as you can see for in this case
when<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> goes<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> stone<00:00:49.800> edge<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> then

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when it goes for the stone edge and then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.959 
when it goes for the stone edge and then
I<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:53.039> special

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I just want to have some special

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.229 
I just want to have some special
defenses<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.930> my<00:00:55.170> side<00:00:55.500> too<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.820> set<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.210> my

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
defenses on my side too and I set up my

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.619 
defenses on my side too and I set up my
light<00:00:57.899> screens<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:59.129> toxic<00:00:59.699> groudon

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
light screens I also toxic groudon

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
light screens I also toxic groudon
because<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> figure<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.250> off

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
because I figure it where it off

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.690 
because I figure it where it off
eventually<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> big

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
eventually so it's not going to be a big

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
eventually so it's not going to be a big
problem<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.540> helped<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.049> lot<00:01:07.229> later

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
problem it actually helped a lot later

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
problem it actually helped a lot later
in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> match<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.640> toxic<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
in the match that it was toxic so I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
in the match that it was toxic so I
guess<00:01:09.900> you'll<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.189> he<00:01:11.310> goes<00:01:11.430> into

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
guess you'll see that so he goes into

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.350 
guess you'll see that so he goes into
lugia<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.470> grout<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:14.360> because

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
lugia and I go into my grout on because

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.980 
lugia and I go into my grout on because
I<00:01:15.990> thought<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:18.240> need<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.689> set<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.900> my

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I thought that I need to set up my

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
I thought that I need to set up my
stealth<00:01:19.409> rocks<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.759> also<00:01:20.909> figured<00:01:21.270> I'm

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
stealth rocks and I also figured I'm

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.100 
stealth rocks and I also figured I'm
okay<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> stay<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.600> first<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
okay if I stay in because first of all I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.350 
okay if I stay in because first of all I
also<00:01:25.290> carry<00:01:25.860> Thunder<00:01:26.340> why<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.000> thunder

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
also carry Thunder why so if I thunder

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.480 
also carry Thunder why so if I thunder
wave<00:01:27.479> lugia<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.340> much

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
wave lugia that's gonna be so much

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.749 
wave lugia that's gonna be so much
easier<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.939> me<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:31.439> also<00:01:31.740> i<00:01:32.130> also<00:01:32.430> know

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
easier for me and i also i also know

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.240 
easier for me and i also i also know
that<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.840> light<00:01:34.170> screen<00:01:34.590> still<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.070> he

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that with my light screen still up he

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.010 
that with my light screen still up he
won't<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.579> able<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.270> damage<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.900> me

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
even if it was super effective so i go

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740 
even if it was super effective so i go
into<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.159> Diago<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:42.090> got<00:01:42.210> brought<00:01:42.509> in

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
into my Diago because it got brought in

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.620 
into my Diago because it got brought in
because<00:01:43.380> he<00:01:43.710> went<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> dragon<00:01:44.790> tail<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because he went for the dragon tail so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
because he went for the dragon tail so
it's<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> whirlwind<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610

me to sleep so I'm going into my deoxys

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.680 
me to sleep so I'm going into my deoxys
although<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:59.610> an<00:01:59.909> iffy<00:02:00.390> move

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
although that was like it's an iffy move

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.550 
although that was like it's an iffy move
since<00:02:01.140> dark<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.920> easily<00:02:02.460> hit<00:02:02.700> me<00:02:02.940> with<00:02:03.180> a

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
since dark I can easily hit me with a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.290 
since dark I can easily hit me with a
dark<00:02:04.560> pulse<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.190> dark-type<00:02:05.550> move<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
dark pulse or a dark-type move for a

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.419 
dark pulse or a dark-type move for a
super<00:02:06.630> effective<00:02:06.900> damage<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.039> only<00:02:08.190> way

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
super effective damage and the only way

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.010 
super effective damage and the only way
can<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.030> damaged<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.539> dark<00:02:09.750> rides

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
can really get damaged on dark rides

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
can really get damaged on dark rides
through<00:02:10.289> toxic<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.580> he<00:02:11.730> move

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
through toxic so it was and if he move

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.479 
through toxic so it was and if he move
although<00:02:12.840> he's<00:02:13.050> still<00:02:13.440> continues<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.280> for

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
although he's still continues to go for

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.910 
although he's still continues to go for
the<00:02:14.520> dark<00:02:14.970> void<00:02:15.300> which<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.720> really<00:02:16.200> weird<00:02:16.530> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the dark void which is really weird and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.940 
the dark void which is really weird and
I<00:02:17.640> get<00:02:17.819> one<00:02:18.090> turn<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> pair<00:02:18.660> hack<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.770> is

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
I get one turn a pair hack so this is

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.979 
I get one turn a pair hack so this is
really<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.670> whatever<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.660> doesn't<00:02:21.959> really

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
really just a whatever it doesn't really

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.960 
really just a whatever it doesn't really
matter<00:02:22.320> I've<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> figured<00:02:23.850> at<00:02:23.940> least

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
matter I've I but I figured at least

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.970 
matter I've I but I figured at least
with<00:02:24.330> my<00:02:24.510> light<00:02:24.720> screen<00:02:25.080> up<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.380> live<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.769> least

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.400 
with my light screen up at live at least
one<00:02:26.280> move<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.239> too<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.480> trouble<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
one move I'm not in too much trouble so

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.670 
one move I'm not in too much trouble so
outcomes<00:02:29.370> Rayquaza<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.470> Rick

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
swords dance in this case so I know I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
swords dance in this case so I know I
need<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.709> get<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> reflect<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.000> order<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
need to get a reflect up in order to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.199 
need to get a reflect up in order to
boost<00:02:39.870> my<00:02:40.200> defenses<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.250> negate<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.850> effects

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
boost my defenses and negate the effects

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.530 
boost my defenses and negate the effects

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
of his stat boosting moves so now I go

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.390 
of his stat boosting moves so now I go
into<00:02:45.660> my<00:02:45.840> groudon<00:02:46.260> because<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:47.160> grad

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
into my groudon because I know my grad

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.150

I'm<00:02:47.580> will<00:02:47.819> be<00:02:48.030> able<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.330> least<00:02:48.540> live<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:49.860> hit

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
I'm will be able to least live one hit

I'm will be able to least live one hit
from<00:02:50.459> nursery<00:02:50.850> quaza<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.170> enough<00:02:52.739> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
from nursery quaza and that is enough to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.190 
from nursery quaza and that is enough to
let<00:02:53.430> me<00:02:53.610> paralyzed<00:02:54.209> him<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.630> my<00:02:54.780> own<00:02:54.810> Thunder

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
let me paralyzed him with my own Thunder

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.860 
let me paralyzed him with my own Thunder
Wave<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.829> he<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.940> no<00:02:57.120> longer<00:02:57.299> going<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.690> be<00:02:57.750> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
Wave and he is no longer going to be a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.039 
Wave and he is no longer going to be a
problem<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.860> his<00:02:59.160> extreme<00:02:59.700> speeds<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.810> his

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
problem with his extreme speeds and his

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.100 
problem with his extreme speeds and his
outrageous<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.980> whatnot<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.900> going

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
outrageous and whatnot like it's going

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.420 
outrageous and whatnot like it's going
to<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.410> much<00:03:04.530> easier<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:04.890> me<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.190> deal<00:03:05.400> with

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
to be so much easier for me to deal with

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.850 
to be so much easier for me to deal with
this<00:03:05.640> because<00:03:06.090> I'll<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.540> able<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.049> add<00:03:07.470> speed

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
this because I'll be able to add speed

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.440 
this because I'll be able to add speed
him<00:03:07.980> next<00:03:08.190> turn<00:03:08.489> although<00:03:08.820> he<00:03:09.000> goes<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.390> an

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
him next turn although he goes for an

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.979 
him next turn although he goes for an
extreme<00:03:09.870> seat<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:11.430> plus<00:03:11.850> for<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.360> really

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
extreme seat but at plus for that really

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.400 
extreme seat but at plus for that really
does<00:03:13.200> not<00:03:13.440> do<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> lot<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.790> I'm<00:03:15.420> able<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.959> drag

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
does not do a lot so I'm able to drag

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.610 
does not do a lot so I'm able to drag
and<00:03:16.590> claw<00:03:16.860> him<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.610> get<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.820> KO<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:19.049> this

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
and claw him and get the KO so this

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.890 
and claw him and get the KO so this
rakossa<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.209> way<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:21.780> of

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
rakossa is out of the way it's one of

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.150 
rakossa is out of the way it's one of
the<00:03:21.989> things<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:22.440> most<00:03:22.560> worried<00:03:23.070> about

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the things I was most worried about

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.520 
the things I was most worried about
because<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.760> carries<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.510> extreme<00:03:25.140> speed

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
because it carries that extreme speed

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.380 
because it carries that extreme speed
and<00:03:25.829> unable<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.829> know<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:28.860> stay<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.760> here<00:03:30.090> he

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
and unable to know I stay in here he

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.970 
and unable to know I stay in here he
goes<00:03:30.510> into<00:03:30.780> Greta<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.290> I'm<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:31.859> sure

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
goes into Greta and I'm not really sure

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.979 
goes into Greta and I'm not really sure
what<00:03:32.370> he<00:03:32.459> wants<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.820> do<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.269> don't<00:03:33.720> want<00:03:33.900> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
what he wants to do I don't want to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.660 
what he wants to do I don't want to
switch<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.709> fear<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.010> him<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
switch for the fear of him going for the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.729 
switch for the fear of him going for the
thunder<00:03:36.030> wave<00:03:36.150> again<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.780> he<00:03:37.500> does

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
thunder wave again and he does

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.140 
thunder wave again and he does
predicting<00:03:38.489> me<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.790> switch<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.600> I'm<00:03:40.350> all<00:03:40.709> like

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
predicting me to switch so I'm all like

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
helping out my team so much he goes into

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.710 
helping out my team so much he goes into
Palkia<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:53.430> i'm<00:04:54.430> thinking<00:04:54.490> it's<00:04:55.150> gonna<00:04:55.270> go<00:04:55.510> for

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
Palkia so i'm thinking it's gonna go for

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.320 
Palkia so i'm thinking it's gonna go for
like<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.080> Draco<00:04:56.590> meteor<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:57.040> dragon<00:04:57.730> move<00:04:57.910> there

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
like a Draco meteor a dragon move there

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.380 
like a Draco meteor a dragon move there
isn't<00:04:58.870> really<00:04:58.960> any<00:04:59.740> pretty<00:05:00.460> obvious<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.180> I

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
isn't really any pretty obvious so I

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.080 
isn't really any pretty obvious so I
don't<00:05:01.840> have<00:05:02.020> any<00:05:02.290> solid<00:05:02.740> steel<00:05:03.310> types<00:05:03.730> what<00:05:04.060> I

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
don't have any solid steel types what I

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.540 
don't have any solid steel types what I
do<00:05:04.210> have<00:05:04.480> dialga<00:05:05.080> which<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.440> steel<00:05:05.800> &amp;<00:05:06.040> Dragons

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
do have dialga which is steel &amp; Dragons

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.540 
do have dialga which is steel &amp; Dragons
so<00:05:06.820> he'll<00:05:07.570> at<00:05:07.810> least<00:05:07.840> get<00:05:08.470> neutral<00:05:08.980> damage<00:05:09.370> on

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
so he'll at least get neutral damage on

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.000 
so he'll at least get neutral damage on
me<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:09.880> even<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.420> does<00:05:10.780> not<00:05:10.990> do<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.350> lot<00:05:11.650> so

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
me and even that does not do a lot so

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.270 
me and even that does not do a lot so
I'm<00:05:12.190> feeling<00:05:12.520> really<00:05:13.090> safe<00:05:13.540> now<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:15.040> just

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
self-explanatory he doesn't have any

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.630 
self-explanatory he doesn't have any
steel<00:05:19.960> types<00:05:20.260> on<00:05:20.440> his<00:05:20.560> team<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:21.040> that's

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
steel types on his team so that's

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.490 
steel types on his team so that's
alright<00:05:22.030> i<00:05:22.060> go<00:05:22.270> for<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.480> dragon<00:05:22.900> pulse<00:05:23.110> i'll

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500

alright i go for the dragon pulse i'll
hit<00:05:23.830> whatever<00:05:24.010> comes<00:05:24.400> in<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:24.760> in<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:25.000> case

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
hit whatever comes in and in this case

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.290 
hit whatever comes in and in this case
it's<00:05:25.450> lugia<00:05:25.930> i<00:05:26.110> do<00:05:26.470> get<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:26.860> crit<00:05:27.220> but<00:05:27.610> i<00:05:27.850> don't

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
it's lugia i do get a crit but i don't

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.420 
it's lugia i do get a crit but i don't
think<00:05:28.420> honestly<00:05:29.320> that<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.710> really<00:05:29.950> mattered
