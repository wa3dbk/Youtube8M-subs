while I spend ages running around to get

while I spend ages running around to get
the<00:00:21.359> ammo<00:00:21.449> crate<00:00:21.720> locations<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.380> went<00:00:22.560> by

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the ammo crate locations I went by

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
the ammo crate locations I went by
really<00:00:22.730> roundabout<00:00:23.730> route<00:00:24.000> I'll<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
really roundabout route I'll just

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.769 
really roundabout route I'll just
explain<00:00:25.500> ammo<00:00:26.160> crates<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.849> valuable<00:00:27.750> in

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
explain ammo crates are valuable in

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
explain ammo crates are valuable in
scavenge<00:00:28.260> mode<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.980> very

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
scavenge mode because you have a very

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.049 
scavenge mode because you have a very
limited<00:00:29.900> magazine<00:00:31.399> in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> weapons<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
limited magazine in the weapons that you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
limited magazine in the weapons that you
scavenge<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> good<00:00:34.469> weapon<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
scavenge so if you get a good weapon and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
scavenge so if you get a good weapon and
you<00:00:35.190> want<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> keep<00:00:35.670> hold<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> reload

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you want to keep hold of it and reload

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.650 
you want to keep hold of it and reload
the<00:00:37.380> ammo<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.790> ammo<00:00:39.180> crate<00:00:39.450> on

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the ammo you can go to the ammo crate on

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
the ammo you can go to the ammo crate on
each<00:00:39.899> level<00:00:40.200> obviously<00:00:40.500> you'll<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.280> quite

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
each level obviously you'll be quite

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
each level obviously you'll be quite
lucky<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.239> without<00:00:42.570> dying<00:00:43.219> so

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
lucky if you get there without dying so

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.770 
lucky if you get there without dying so
it's<00:00:44.370> more<00:00:44.520> useful<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:45.120> you've<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.420> kind

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it's more useful if you've actually kind

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
it's more useful if you've actually kind
of<00:00:45.980> run<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> ammo<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.670> actually

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
of run out of ammo when you're actually

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
of run out of ammo when you're actually
near<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> weapon<00:00:48.539> near<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> ammo<00:00:49.350> crate<00:00:49.850> then

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
near the weapon near the ammo crate then

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.950 
near the weapon near the ammo crate then
you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.090> run<00:00:51.239> over<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.480> top<00:00:52.079> up

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080 

so<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:56.040> there's<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> first<00:00:56.550> ammo<00:00:56.879> crate

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so they go there's the first ammo crate

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.190 
so they go there's the first ammo crate
you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.690> near<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
you can see when you get near to it you

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.010 
you can see when you get near to it you
get<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> sign<00:00:58.649> coming<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.040> saying<00:00:59.280> our<00:00:59.460> crate

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
get the sign coming up saying our crate

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.119 
get the sign coming up saying our crate
let's<00:01:01.020> write<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> middle<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:01.770> open

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
let's write the middle of all these open

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
let's write the middle of all these open
windows<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.460> I'll<00:01:02.820> bring<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> map<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.540> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
windows and I'll bring up the map in a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260 
windows and I'll bring up the map in a
sec<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.840> show<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:05.060> there<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> go

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
sec to show you where it is there you go

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.250 
sec to show you where it is there you go
you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.750> right<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.050> middle<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
you can see it's right in the middle of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.700 
you can see it's right in the middle of
that<00:01:07.409> path<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:08.940> massively<00:01:09.330> safe

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
that path so it's not massively safe

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.120 
that path so it's not massively safe
next<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> Tala<00:01:11.610> Tala<00:01:12.090> Tala<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.470> don't<00:01:13.979> know

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
next we have Tala Tala Tala I don't know

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.480 
next we have Tala Tala Tala I don't know
teller<00:01:14.640> market<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.340> I've

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
teller market so you can see I've

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
teller market so you can see I've
spawned<00:01:17.940> handily<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.720> near<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.920> I'm

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
spawned handily right near it so I'm

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
spawned handily right near it so I'm
just<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.280> over<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> edge<00:01:21.149> of<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
just gonna go over to the edge of the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
just gonna go over to the edge of the
map<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.680> bee<00:01:22.860> flag<00:01:23.190> just<00:01:23.580> coming

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
map you can see the bee flag just coming

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.630 
map you can see the bee flag just coming
up<00:01:23.940> there<00:01:24.470> then<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> ammo<00:01:25.830> crate<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> Right

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
up there then the ammo crate is Right

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
up there then the ammo crate is Right
nearby<00:01:26.850> generally<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> ammo<00:01:27.899> crates<00:01:28.200> are

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
nearby generally the ammo crates are

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.580 
nearby generally the ammo crates are
near<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.039> flag<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.670> handy<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
near the be flag that's a handy kind of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
near the be flag that's a handy kind of
rough<00:01:31.590> reminder<00:01:32.190> there's<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.729> ammo<00:01:32.880> crate<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
rough reminder there's the ammo crate is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380 
rough reminder there's the ammo crate is
right<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> edge<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.020> map<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.119> 20<00:01:36.119> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
right on the edge of the map and 20 to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
right on the edge of the map and 20 to
reload<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> walk<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> front<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
reload you just walk up to the front of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.499 
reload you just walk up to the front of
the<00:01:38.369> ammo<00:01:38.490> crate<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.910> it<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.060> automatically

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the ammo crate and it will automatically

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
the ammo crate and it will automatically
really<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.350> need<00:01:40.410> to<00:01:40.619> press<00:01:40.890> anything

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
really you don't need to press anything

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.620 
really you don't need to press anything
but<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.550> do<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> front<00:01:42.300> or<00:01:42.570> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
but you do have to be at the front or on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.990 
but you do have to be at the front or on
top<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.580> map<00:01:44.670> there
