00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 fullum installed in california because 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.600
 that in fact in my village in France 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.389
 called me the diviner I did a lot 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.809
 revelations and especially one that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 turned out to be accurate which I will not talk about 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 not here that's not the point and he 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.449
 really had to leave the country 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
 and now 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.660
 for 20 years I am installed here in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.689
 california and and I feel good oh no 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.400
 no no no no no it would be 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 really it would really be the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 science fiction no no no no I'm 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.739
 someone who works with images 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.510
 so here I saw a man on the moon 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.149
 market on the moon 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 Arriving with a rocket this will be done 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.489
 that it was in 1950 I had barely 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 I was barely ten years old so we also 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.539
 the imagination of his age so a rocket 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.879
 a man walking on the moon 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.399
 I always said my parents we're going 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.460
 go to the moon in 1969 so that wants 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 to say obviously he was at once 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 touched i think yes i actually 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 always images including particular 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 very strong images as to 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 in fact there is nuclear energy 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.450
 that's because we're coming towards the end 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 oil energy 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.040
 we saw clearly what happened there on 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.409
 in recent years and so we're going towards 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.570
 nuclear energy is there the energy 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.900
 nuclear power will bring its share of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.600
 disasters in particular 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.070
 in urss I predict for the end of the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.950
 decade before the end of the decade 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.600
 is not it a major disaster 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.080
 who will be able to question 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.610
 the very use of nuclear we are going 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.800
 have electric cars we will have 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.470
 electric cars and its very 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:54.650
 quickly around the years I 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:57.440
 think 2000-2010 my year to fetish 2000 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.450
 2005 petrol cars will not exist 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.180
 the more we will be on cars 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.670
 electric and I think we will have if this 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.660
 is not marketed in any case 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.920
 found the solution of the flying car 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.160
 the magnetic car 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.890
 that's it I can see it quite 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.670
 very clearly it's relatively crazy 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.700
 but in any case what is certain 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.350
 is that in the first decade of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.350
 which will follow the year 2000 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.330
 America will be attacked no no no it 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.620
 This is not an attack abroad 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.100
 it is an attack on the ground 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.280
 American 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 this is a really new one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 pearl harbor it's a shelling and I 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.850
 see cities like los angeles 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.480
 especially new york getting bombed 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.100
 new york get bombed and this in 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.120
 the first decade after the year 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.260
 2000 here it is obvious without name 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.940
 but as I told you the block of 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.590
 is in ten years will hardly exist 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.030
 more so we can imagine that at dawn 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.090
 of the year 2000 not only are they our 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.070
 allies but on top of that we will not talk 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.780
 the more I pull we will not talk anymore about block 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.940
 Soviet 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.180
 no it's very very clear the causes 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.310
 of these attacks and co2 these conflicts 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.650
 will first be related to energy 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.200
 it's obvious the energy the oil the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.450
 oil war is going to return soon 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.010
 in shares and in not long 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.950
 and secondly 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.239
 problems a religion war on 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.239
 returns to wars of religion 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.319
 yes and a change that will be a 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:39.129
 popular revolution 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.069
 a popular revolution since the 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.379
 american people 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.930
 will elect between 2005 and 2012 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.019
 it's very clear here again to black at the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.319
 head of the most powerful country in the world 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:04:01.139
 black goes out to the most powerful man the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:03.209
 world and it will be brought by a momentum 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.000
 popular really people will be 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.569
 behind this man who will be welcomed 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.829
 probably not as a messiah in 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.709
 any case as as a savior the spirit 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:22.049
 of a change for a america that re 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:26.070
 suffered I think the world in a hundred 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.270
 years old then it's both a fantasy 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.650
 for me it amuses me a lot I try 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.139
 always to imagine but the problem 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.060
 it's that I do not see anything for these 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.880
 years there because unfortunately this 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.699
 which concerns me I do not see anything 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.139
 after 2012 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.270
 I do not see anything after 2012 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.270
 I do not have a flash I do not have an image 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.620
 after 2012 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.240
 it 's not for nothing if I do not have 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.470
 image after 2012 when that's 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.669
 something that I have since little 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:05:00.570
 it's actually my own death 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:07.620
 which is likely I do not exclude I do not 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:10.440
 hope not either because the problem 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.460
 is that I also see the right too 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:22.199
 the meet do not know how you 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.370
 to say that but I see also we go 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.620
 probably meet others 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.150
 people 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.960
 yes meeting 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.630
 two extra meetings 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.030
 terrestrial here is the bad pitch and in 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.180
 same time if you're here it's for 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:45.970
 for us to talk about 2012 for 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.110
 me it's the year of the meeting I 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.940
 do not know whether to really talk about 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.010
 great the problem is that I 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.560
 think they will be so much ahead 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.430
 on us imagine they come from the end 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.680
 background of the galaxy 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.240
 for now we were on the moon 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.270
 but happy but happy in my but 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.660
 it's a conflict you I listen to you and 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.240
 listen to what I say we will have the 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.630
 visit of people who will be much more 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:20.110
 powerful that we there are losers 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.860
 and winners in a conflict we 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.660
 will be the losers 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.370
 you have to make sure that if I do not see 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.770
 nothing after 2012 it's for a reason 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:33.720
 it is clear that humanity will have 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.720
 gone good but we'll stop there
