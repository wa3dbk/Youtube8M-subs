00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 pear tree or you put it on the steering wheel does not end 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 by understanding what is the position of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.410
 Javier cuts but does not lack in the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.290
 headline 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.950
 they are fulfilling are two days cello 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.360
 alatorre and it seems that yes that is 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.960
 fulfilling that is if it is going to fill that 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.700
 hollow on the right is very early and it's 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.750
 very early still for two 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.119
 days and how they have looked 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.180
 regular medium not what is needed 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.220
 so far but need to see more of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.019
 what is being projected has been a 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.629
 regular player has never been a great 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.460
 star on the right plot but has 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.500
 been a regular player to verón yes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.540
 we will see it in the next summon 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.350
 is later the selection there is no 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.350
 right lateral 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.829
 we arrange coach is the guy that 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.440
 can fight to paul aguilar the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 ownership that has it covered by more 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.130
 beyond its capacity it is very capable but 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.810
 never miguel herrera wanted to look for him 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.340
 someone who competed with you is the truth and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.180
 this kind of seems to be in a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.180
 team with greater prominence because I 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 leave 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 I fought for not competing 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.210
 14 normal reading of bitter is the end of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.240
 Cougars week but not at all 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.330
 any way if I agree 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.470
 that what has been seen if it is 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.570
 important to be in a team 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.220
 protagonist of course you have another 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.439
 exhibition you have other levels of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.479
 requirement but it also depends a lot 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.009
 how do you adapt to the system and how much 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.450
 number of matches that the 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.509
 technical for the time being is lining up 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.289
 and that's going to be good but from there to that 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.789
 we are thinking that it is the future in 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.709
 right side of the Mexican national team 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.450
 there is still a way to go not 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.860
 because I can not get there but because there 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.080
 a road through although town is in the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.840
 fight for not descending the one that has more 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.670
 what to lose is the cougar team for the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.759
 time for continuity but about 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.100
 all the players already after so many 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.180
 tournaments that have been handled that this one 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.620
 do not finish giving you the rating 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.110
 waters because then if you will have to 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.940
 come already a strong sweeper if you do not 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.690
 get the goal with everything that has 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.450
 past 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.550
 I'll touch you on the other side, sorry 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.720
 puebla rescaldani I think it's for 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.480
 headline 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.950
 started with king marin and the first 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.690
 match or vao denied 2 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.510
 could only two goals 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.989
 even size could be higher 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 speed with more minutes 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.340
 to use rescaldani speed 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 and the position that has what today has 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.140
 finished by demonstrating that he is bully not 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.660
 climb 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.849
 of those men that you drive handle 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.840
 line four back two contentions 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.840
 the key is in how fliers is alústiza 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.959
 that is very titularísimo 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 the hobbit hobbit and flash and saints radios 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.380
 to them 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.810
 I believe that between hobbit and flavio one of 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.239
 both have to be sacrificed or for 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.180
 play with the forwards or to give 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.519
 is my geography to give you the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.760
 page of bed capacity and akamai to tampa 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.010
 bay for terms putting like 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.060
 king's companion 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.060
 to the lad you 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.519
 and I do not see it wrong, it seems to me 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.110
 sacrificed can be king and put 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.170
 rescaldani and alústiza 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.209
 because the king and rescaldani of some 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 form are very footballistically 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.040
 similar but I think it's going to end 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.950
 being rescaldani much more support for 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.440
 alústiza runner of the 12 boots and the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.540
 another always ends fixed the king always 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.549
 ends by voting would be two of the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.530
 same and in the case of size me 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.720
 it seems more like a very good option 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.180
 to have an offensive variant in 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.730
 change if as a change either because 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.379
 you start looking to press or be a 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.970
 alternative for long trips 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.160
 we already know that he has a very good dribble 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.449
 faces goes with very good speed in 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.669
 the work by the bands in the 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.079
 diagonal towards the center and it's a 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.079
 good alternative is also wrong 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.530
 complexed with a match only seen 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.500
 board of the cup that is not reference in 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.570
 Favorite people's chances and above all 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.120
 ends up being at home and because that 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.700
 visiting cougar situation now you 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.260
 is weighing now you have to take out the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.540
 face to cougars because it is also a team 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.120
 that the technician was given continuity 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.760
 so even when you're starting 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.880
 this moradoras and is that there are few 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.240
 elements that embedded like that is that you 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.000
 the system that you're working on already 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.820
 They have been doing it since 17 dates 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.040
 earlier there is not much to say that 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.040
 not understood with the understood if it is 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.890
 enter pace within the tournament but 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.430
 with that question that you already 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.080
 they know this system and more quickly 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.980
 it has to be observed that putting it in 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.980
 practice for the tournament
