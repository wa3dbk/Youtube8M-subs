in<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:00.570> video<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> show<00:00:02.190> how<00:00:02.580> I

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
in this video I'm going to show how I

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.559 
in this video I'm going to show how I
harvested<00:00:03.720> mustard<00:00:04.380> seed<00:00:05.210> these<00:00:06.210> are<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
harvested mustard seed these are the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.960 
harvested mustard seed these are the
shoots<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.200> came<00:00:07.470> up<00:00:07.649> after<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.099> planted<00:00:08.730> a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
shoots that came up after I planted a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.580 
shoots that came up after I planted a
couple<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.480> seeds<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:11.300> then<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.809> plants<00:00:13.290> grew

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
couple of seeds and then the plants grew

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.660 
couple of seeds and then the plants grew
and<00:00:14.130> then<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.929> mustard<00:00:16.580> fruits<00:00:17.580> came<00:00:18.570> up

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
and then the mustard fruits came up

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
and then the mustard fruits came up
after<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:21.000> were<00:00:21.080> fully<00:00:22.080> ripe<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.650> dry

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
after they were fully ripe and dry

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.580 
after they were fully ripe and dry
almost<00:00:23.640> dry<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.410> harvested<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.810> I<00:00:27.810> took

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
almost dry I harvested them and I took

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
almost dry I harvested them and I took
the<00:00:28.800> dried<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> pot<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.179> put<00:00:30.630> them<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the dried a pot and put them in a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.520 
the dried a pot and put them in a
plastic<00:00:31.769> pocket<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.739> close<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.219> ziplock<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
plastic pocket and close the ziplock and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.319 
plastic pocket and close the ziplock and
gently<00:00:37.530> crushed<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.969> parts<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:41.250> loosen<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
gently crushed the parts to loosen the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.990 
gently crushed the parts to loosen the
seeds

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.830 

and<00:00:53.000> then

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
and then

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.950 
and then
further<00:00:54.200> crush<00:00:54.620> them<00:00:54.890> with<00:00:55.070> my<00:00:55.280> hand<00:00:55.930> you<00:00:56.930> can

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
further crush them with my hand you can

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.010 
further crush them with my hand you can
see<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.740> seeds<00:00:58.010> are<00:00:58.660> starting<00:00:59.660> to<00:00:59.840> come

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
see that the seeds are starting to come

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:12.210 
see that the seeds are starting to come
out

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.860 

and<00:01:12.310> then<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.180> separated<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.350> chaff<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:16.630> the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
and then I separated the chaff from the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.580 
and then I separated the chaff from the
seeds<00:01:18.030> there's<00:01:19.030> some<00:01:19.420> more<00:01:19.630> there<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.470> I'm

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
seeds there's some more there that I'm

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.900 
seeds there's some more there that I'm
going<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:21.120> see<00:01:22.120> if<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.570> put<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.980> chaff<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.790> the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
going to see if I put the chaff and the

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.830 
going to see if I put the chaff and the
seeds<00:01:25.620> through<00:01:26.620> a<00:01:26.650> sieve<00:01:27.300> you<00:01:28.300> can<00:01:28.480> see<00:01:28.660> that

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
seeds through a sieve you can see that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.780 
seeds through a sieve you can see that
the<00:01:28.990> seeds<00:01:29.260> are<00:01:29.650> starting<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.280> fall<00:01:30.520> through

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
the seeds are starting to fall through

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.170 
the seeds are starting to fall through
the<00:01:30.970> sieve<00:01:31.210> I<00:01:32.220> gathered<00:01:33.220> everything<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:34.060> a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
the sieve I gathered everything in a

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.830 
the sieve I gathered everything in a
container

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:50.069 

and<00:01:42.110> gently<00:01:43.110> blew<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.159> rest<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> chaff

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.980 

it's<00:01:50.619> important<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.310> be<00:01:51.430> gentle<00:01:51.939> because<00:01:52.689> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
it's important to be gentle because the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.010 
it's important to be gentle because the
mustard<00:01:53.409> seeds<00:01:53.710> are<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.219> light<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:54.820> they<00:01:55.570> may

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
mustard seeds are so light that they may

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.959 
mustard seeds are so light that they may
blow<00:01:56.259> a<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.969> here<00:01:58.450> they<00:01:59.320> are<00:01:59.700> my<00:02:00.700> own

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
blow a to you so here they are my own

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:07.679 
blow a to you so here they are my own
homegrown<00:02:02.069> mustard<00:02:03.069> seeds<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.960> 20<00:02:05.409> grams
