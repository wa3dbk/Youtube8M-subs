00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
very hard to touch up to make it look in
keeping<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.360> rest<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.259> course

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.810 
keeping with the rest of it of course
you<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> same<00:01:17.130> problem<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.580> seam

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you have the same problem with seam

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.219 
you have the same problem with seam
lines<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.330> glue<00:01:18.540> two<00:01:18.750> hearts<00:01:19.080> together

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
lines you glue two hearts together

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
lines you glue two hearts together
you're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> seam<00:01:20.040> line<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> if

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you're going to get seam line and and if

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
you're going to get seam line and and if
you<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.680> picky<00:01:22.920> about<00:01:23.040> your

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you are going to be picky about your

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
you are going to be picky about your
build<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.759> obviously<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:25.020> going

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
build then obviously it's just not going

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.120 
build then obviously it's just not going
to<00:01:25.409> look<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> part

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to look the part

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
to look the part
so<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.689> most<00:01:27.990> cases<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.090> chrome<00:01:30.780> finish

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so in most cases the the chrome finish

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.910 
so in most cases the the chrome finish
will<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.290> stripped<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.119> replaced<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
will be stripped and replaced so in this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
will be stripped and replaced so in this
case<00:01:35.240> we're<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> strip<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> chrome

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
case we're going to strip the chrome

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.480 
case we're going to strip the chrome

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
finish on all four of these I'll just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.359

cam and which is for a project I've got

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.229 
cam and which is for a project I've got
going<00:04:08.769> at<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:08.950> moment<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:12.340> yes<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.090> can

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
going at the moment that yes you can

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.259 
going at the moment that yes you can
certainly<00:04:13.450> see<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.810> now<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.670> say<00:04:15.940> in

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
certainly see that now and as I say in

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.909 
certainly see that now and as I say in
this<00:04:16.419> case<00:04:16.630> black<00:04:16.930> plastic<00:04:17.410> underneath<00:04:17.650> in

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
this case black plastic underneath in

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.069 
this case black plastic underneath in
most<00:04:18.130> cases<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:18.669> in<00:04:19.060> some<00:04:19.570> cases<00:04:19.810> you'll

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
most cases it is in some cases you'll

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.400 
most cases it is in some cases you'll
find<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.470> white<00:04:20.709> sort<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.310> resin<00:04:21.729> type<00:04:22.410> plastic

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
find a white sort of resin type plastic

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.730 
find a white sort of resin type plastic
underneath<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:24.479> ultimately<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:26.380> the

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
underneath but ultimately the the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.600 
underneath but ultimately the the
procedure<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.280> same

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
procedure is the same

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.760 
procedure is the same
I<00:04:27.820> find<00:04:28.419> this<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.600> quickening<00:04:29.110> quickest<00:04:29.590> and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
I find this a quickening quickest and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.100 
I find this a quickening quickest and
the<00:04:29.800> easiest<00:04:29.860> way<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.639> remove<00:04:31.120> chrome<00:04:31.660> plating

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
the easiest way to remove chrome plating

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.570 
the easiest way to remove chrome plating
doesn't<00:04:32.410> harm<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.710> plastic<00:04:33.070> part<00:04:33.310> in<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
doesn't harm the plastic part in the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.350 
doesn't harm the plastic part in the
slightest<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:35.039> then<00:04:36.039> it<00:04:36.729> certainly<00:04:37.150> worked

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
slightest and then it certainly worked

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.210 
slightest and then it certainly worked
for<00:04:37.570> me<00:04:37.690> every<00:04:37.960> time<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.470> everybody<00:04:39.039> has

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
for me every time and everybody has

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.040 
for me every time and everybody has

bleach that's actually irrelevant

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.090
