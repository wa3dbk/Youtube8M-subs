00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.290
 hello my name is benjamin aillaud and 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.839
 I present you photo photo at 4 years 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.759
 so it's a young horse and I come 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.950
 talk to you today about problems 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.949
 boarding everyone who has 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.960
 horses to a day spend time 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.550
 behind his belly behind his truck 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560
 simply because the horse is 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.240
 impressed every time he has to 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.759
 enter an empty space 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.559
 do I come here you propose 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.930
 are some techniques a few ways 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.489
 to approach the horse to just make him 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.410
 understand that a truck or a wind 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.120
 ignorant m dangerous in there 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.680
 and how can we ask 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.110
 horse to advance one of the principles of 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 base is to advance a horse 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.410
 the reflex is to push him behind 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.300
 and although this reflex and then we will forget 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.449
 and we will work just for the sale of the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.270
 horse is to practice that I have 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.710
 favorite when you have a horse he 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.000
 do not want to ride in a truck so 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.609
 he shoots who escapes 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 I preferred two things 1 meter the wind 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.710
 in a secure farmer's place with 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.289
 barriers 2 led the horse with a 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.000
 net is always a colbert catch here 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.709
 in turn and I'll explain more 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.560
 late the interest of that compared to 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:18.200
 nicole I want to be able to prevent the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.450
 horse back by no one 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.860
 will push the horse behind that is to say 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.300
 as we often see with songs 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.840
 Behind the hips for the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.149
 move forward 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.080
 and everything will happen on the front the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.440
 principle is simple 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.599
 that is to say to the horse photo I want that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.670
 you come to me and when they do not 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:36.200
 not come to me gently go on the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.060
 touch at the shoulders 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.130
 at that moment the horse will have a 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.119
 answer at the beginning which will be that of 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.970
 retreat 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.890
 it is for that moment that I have the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.020
 colbert with the loin that will prevent him from 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.759
 to retreat very wisely I prevent the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.890
 horse to recoil when he wants to go back 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.800
 as soon as the horse comes back to me I 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.750
 free and I would trust the base of 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.640
 the relationship on foot is a horse that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.989
 is with you so you have to you 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.090
 get by all means 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.729
 possible forever validated a thing 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 is that the horse is facing you and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.739
 stay all the time happy to come back 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.750
 towards you, that is to say I move if I 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.000
 move here I want the horse to be 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.500
 face to me if I move here I want that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.730
 the horse is facing me 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.280
 when the horse is facing me I 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 reward it seems to be a detail but 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.430
 this is one of the bases that will make that the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.160
 horse will ride in the truck without 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.410
 problem before presenting the horse to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.850
 wind or truck simply I 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.940
 am going to do two small three exercises 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.880
 the first one going to be saying is what I 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.570
 am able if I approach mosquitoes 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.890
 here on the hips 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.240
 does the horse release from its 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.290
 hips 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.210
 when I approach deep down I reassure the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.740
 horse is I am able to 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.070
 do it on the other side of the same 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.520
 way I get closer I get closer to 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.450
 hips 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.610
 it is necessary that the pushed horse angel is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.860
 always have you seen a request a 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.170
 horse's answer a reward 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.240
 that is to say reassure the horse so that 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.560
 his answer to him is to say I know 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.020
 that when I'm close to him 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.360
 I 'm safe I feel good so 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.310
 do not forget to validate it is better 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.290
 that sugar is better than all 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.870
 lyrics it's really about revalidating 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.160
 horse in front of me I reward him is 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.150
 there he is happy 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.280
 from the moment I go back 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.460
 in the difficulty what I'm doing there is 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.410
 very important then when I go 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.450
 get in front of the wind the horse is going to be 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.770
 impressed is going back this is when 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.480
 there I take a little distance 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.460
 I took a stick that is bigger 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.230
 that a dressage stick with a small 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.340
 wick at the end this but that goes me 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.620
 allow to touch the horse to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.250
 the shoulder on the next principle I 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.670
 touch on the shoulder the horse comes to me 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.870
 is again I caress I back off 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.150
 I approach my wand the horse comes to 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.620
 me no problem there it's simple 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.210
 there is no difficulty in crossing 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.770
 so the horse does not question 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.480
 the movement in the front when I will be 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.400
 facing the wind just now we're going 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.400
 look what it gives it's gone al 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:17.470
 there ok the horse look i'm going to check 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.000
 that I can push the hips of a 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.730
 side pushed the hips of the other 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.080
 push the hips on one side pushed them 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.740
 hips on the other side you saw when I 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.930
 pushes the hips 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.790
 I'm shifting to the side at that moment 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.360
 the hips will move and I shift 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.120
 on the other side 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.040
 at that moment I could have already managed the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.160
 horse so that he stays in the lax of the 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.150
 wind properly be careful the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.070
 principle 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.100
 if the horse recedes at that moment the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.050
 lanyard will prevent recoil and and as soon as 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.880
 the horse is calm face to face with the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 wand would generate the impulse instead 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.750
 to go push the horse behind like 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.000
 we often see the pulse will be 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.110
 generated from the front the first time 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.370
 you will touch when your way 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.470
 is not used he will go back 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.300
 definitely prevent you from recoiling and 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.680
 with the hand then you have the moment 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.390
 who can be and critical is the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.270
 moment when you are going to have to go up 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.580
 ensure catches on do not start with 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.850
 to juggle half by being in or 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.740
 out in place I put the hips back 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.360
 in lax by the exercise we have 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.340
 worked everything to their work and love 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.510
 that's why the wand here has to 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.520
 to be a little longer than a whip 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.750
 and shorter than a chambermaid for 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.300
 not that you tangled up the brushes 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.130
 once the easel in the ex to this 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:38.260
 moment I go back and I leave him the 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:50.410
 room for games prevent him from recoiling and 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:53.220
 I bring it back to the village to the property 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.220
 setbacks 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.430
 well paid attention to one thing when the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.430
 horse backing to get off if at a 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.690
 moment it goes back a little faster 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.520
 reassured the horse but do not start 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.110
 to pull on the lanyard for not that if they 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.790
 defend themselves by hand they come 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.010
 to hit his head here is important 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.150
 let the horse back even if the 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.730
 retreat a little fast then 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.340
 restarted airs decompose asked at 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.160
 horse to rest maybe just the 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.100
 interiors and feel comfortable then 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.310
 to back down do not hesitate to break down 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.110
 that's the way you'll do it 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.000
 best ratio for the horse the 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.260
 horse will not learn the wind any 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 simply because at any 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.300
 stage of the ascent of the descent he 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.940
 will be comforted rewarded and start again 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.440
 rewarded is rewarded at that moment 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:47.350
 the horse will understand and if your horse 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.060
 understood you are saved when you 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.210
 prepare your horse to ride in the 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.820
 wind did not pass do not pass 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.460
 hours at the foot of the wind battled 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.990
 simply find the way to 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.300
 that the horse is calmed understand to 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.980
 each of the stages often I see them 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.810
 people once they have been explained 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.220
 that way and start working 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.630
 to hit too hard on the shoulders 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.780
 give the horse time to understand 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.850
 to feel to watch to reassure oneself 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.620
 once they are reassured you 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.140
 deliver that there is not a horse that does not 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.800
 will not trust you like that these 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.570
 bombs did not reproduce the gait 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.970
 many times in other contexts 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.530
 do not forget a secure place if the 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.360
 horse was escaping you 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.610
 they must not be able to go and 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.650
 a good soil when he will turn a little 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.200
 her hips at first avoid the places 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.640
 slippery avoid slippery meadows 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.260
 so that the horse is in 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.660
 porting once you've put these 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.040
 conditions stay calm and think a 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.020
 thing if the horse does not ride in the 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.220
 truck is not against you it's just 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.900
 he is afraid of getting into the truck 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.490
 it will allow you to relax and 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.140
 if you are relaxed you are no longer 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.280
 kind if you are kinder the 

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.550
 horse will you like and will make you 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.550
 trust
