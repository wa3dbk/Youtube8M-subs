down<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.500> street<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.090> wanted<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.359> just

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
down the street and so I wanted to just

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.030 

like<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:14.020> there<00:01:14.320> were<00:01:14.380> different<00:01:14.649> things

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
like that there were different things

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.499 
like that there were different things
that<00:01:15.189> I<00:01:15.220> wanted<00:01:15.579> them<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.850> flush<00:01:16.060> out<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.329> terms

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
that I wanted them to flush out in terms

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.929 
that I wanted them to flush out in terms
of<00:01:16.659> R&amp;D<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.649> so<00:01:18.189> in<00:01:18.310> fact<00:01:18.430> one<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.759> ways

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
of R&amp;D and so in fact one of the ways

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.719 
of R&amp;D and so in fact one of the ways
was<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.299> use<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.810> motor<00:01:20.350> from<00:01:20.560> an<00:01:20.740> RC<00:01:21.070> plane<00:01:21.100> it's

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
was to use a motor from an RC plane it's

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.160 
was to use a motor from an RC plane it's
about<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.970> size<00:01:22.090> your<00:01:22.299> fist<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:23.020> has

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
about the size your fist and it has

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.340 
about the size your fist and it has
about<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.950> same<00:01:24.070> power<00:01:24.399> as<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:25.689> I<00:01:26.049> mean

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
about the same power as that so I mean

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.630 
about the same power as that so I mean
can<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.530> imagine<00:01:26.619> how<00:01:26.890> much<00:01:27.009> even<00:01:27.430> lighter

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
can you imagine how much even lighter

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.550 
can you imagine how much even lighter
that<00:01:27.880> would<00:01:28.030> be<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.659> know<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.200> they<00:01:29.320> tried

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
that would be you know so they tried

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.080 
that would be you know so they tried
that<00:01:29.710> idea<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.159> that<00:01:30.220> that'll<00:01:30.549> probably<00:01:30.970> be

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
that idea and that that'll probably be

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.249 
that idea and that that'll probably be
on<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.270> TV<00:01:31.479> show<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:31.689> know<00:01:31.810> how<00:01:31.899> they<00:01:32.020> flushed

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
on the TV show you know how they flushed

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.020 
on the TV show you know how they flushed
out<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.560> idea<00:01:32.830> yeah<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.399> lot<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.700> people<00:01:33.820> have

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
out that idea yeah a lot of people have

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.980 
out that idea yeah a lot of people have
mentioned<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.360> like<00:01:34.539> oh<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.780> would<00:01:34.869> be<00:01:34.960> a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
mentioned that like oh this would be a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.020 
mentioned that like oh this would be a
great<00:01:35.140> way<00:01:35.229> for<00:01:35.409> people<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.860> get<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.700> work<00:01:36.820> or

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
great way for people to get to work or

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.399 
great way for people to get to work or
commute<00:01:37.299> you<00:01:37.390> know<00:01:37.509> with<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.659> gas<00:01:37.869> prices<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
commute you know with the gas prices the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.169 
commute you know with the gas prices the
way<00:01:38.439> they<00:01:38.530> are<00:01:38.829> I<00:01:39.070> don't<00:01:39.820> know<00:01:39.880> about<00:01:39.939> getting

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
way they are I don't know about getting

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.219 
way they are I don't know about getting
the<00:01:40.240> work<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.479> commuting<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:41.020> was<00:01:41.200> thinking

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
the work in commuting but I was thinking

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.850 
the work in commuting but I was thinking
you<00:01:41.560> know<00:01:41.619> maybe<00:01:41.770> for<00:01:42.100> kids<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.970> get<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.179> school

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you know maybe for kids to get to school

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.649 
you know maybe for kids to get to school
might<00:01:44.860> be<00:01:44.950> an<00:01:45.220> alternative<00:01:45.729> way<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.360> having

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
might be an alternative way so having

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.700 
might be an alternative way so having
the<00:01:46.720> parents<00:01:46.810> fire<00:01:47.110> up<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.319> suburban

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.770 

you
