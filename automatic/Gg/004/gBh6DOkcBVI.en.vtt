00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.560 
earlier but the footage wasn't here and
it<00:01:44.770> was<00:01:44.890> like<00:01:44.979> six<00:01:45.250> hours<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.570> filming

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
including setup time so I didn't want to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.460
