00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and then just prepare to jailbreak so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.510 
and then just prepare to jailbreak so
when<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:02.039> you're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> do

ready to jailbreak so just press
jailbreak<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:56.090> should<00:01:56.329> say<00:01:56.539> jailbreaking

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.580 

and<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:04.610> goes<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:05.000> iphone<00:02:05.390> you'll<00:02:06.380> see<00:02:06.560> a

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and there goes the iphone you'll see a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.100 
and there goes the iphone you'll see a
white<00:02:06.829> screen<00:02:07.159> come<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.390> first<00:02:08.660> real

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
white screen come up it's the first real

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:27.660 
white screen come up it's the first real
sign<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:10.280> seeing<00:02:10.640> anything<00:02:10.819> happen

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:37.760 

perfect

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.200 

so<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.830> does<00:02:38.980> take<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.640> bit<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.910> time<00:02:40.030> but

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
so it does take a bit of time but

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.720 
so it does take a bit of time but
overall<00:02:43.210> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.570> my<00:02:43.720> first<00:02:43.990> try<00:02:44.520> I'm<00:02:45.520> like

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
overall this is my first try I'm like

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580 
overall this is my first try I'm like
yesterday<00:02:46.210> using<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.690> Mac<00:02:46.900> version<00:02:46.930> there

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
yesterday using the Mac version there

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.500 
yesterday using the Mac version there
was<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.740> bit<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.130> glitch<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.850> software

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
was a bit of a glitch in the software

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.230 
was a bit of a glitch in the software
itself<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.560> lot<00:02:50.710> of<00:02:50.740> people<00:02:50.830> having

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
itself and a lot of people having

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.930 
itself and a lot of people having
troubles<00:02:52.240> but<00:02:53.040> seems<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.220> they<00:02:54.370> fix<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
troubles but seems like they fix the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:08.220 
troubles but seems like they fix the
problem

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.619 

and<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:09.920> first<00:03:10.189> sign<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.329> working

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
and so the first sign that it is working

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.539 
and so the first sign that it is working
is<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.680> skull<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.459> Apple<00:03:14.269> animation

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
is the skull and the Apple animation

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.360 
is the skull and the Apple animation
wanted<00:03:16.549> first<00:03:16.700> charges<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.359> it'll<00:03:18.079> be

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
wanted first charges up it'll be

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:32.960 
wanted first charges up it'll be
flashing<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.670> skull

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:51.720 

one

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.000 

so<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> first<00:03:53.780> time<00:03:53.990> going<00:03:54.620> into<00:03:54.770> the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
so this is a first time going into the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.610 
so this is a first time going into the
phone<00:03:55.930> you'll<00:03:56.930> see<00:03:57.170> on<00:03:57.290> your<00:03:57.410> homepage

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
phone you'll see on your homepage

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.530 
phone you'll see on your homepage
they're<00:03:58.370> most<00:03:58.700> likely<00:03:58.850> won't<00:03:59.210> be<00:03:59.360> anything

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
they're most likely won't be anything

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.090 
they're most likely won't be anything
but<00:03:59.900> when<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.200> get<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.560> second<00:04:00.920> page

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
but when you get to the second page

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.250 
but when you get to the second page
there<00:04:01.790> will<00:04:01.940> be<00:04:02.060> an<00:04:02.120> icon<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.510> says<00:04:02.750> loader

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
there will be an icon that says loader

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.770 
there will be an icon that says loader
on<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.950> will<00:04:04.100> be<00:04:04.160> green<00:04:04.520> you<00:04:05.390> just<00:04:05.570> want<00:04:05.720> to

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
on it it will be green you just want to

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.180 
on it it will be green you just want to
click<00:04:05.960> that<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:11.140> then<00:04:12.140> hopefully<00:04:12.770> you'll<00:04:12.980> get

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
click that and then hopefully you'll get

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.780 
click that and then hopefully you'll get
an<00:04:13.900> icon<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:14.930> says<00:04:15.140> cydia<00:04:15.740> so<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.489> just<00:04:16.640> want

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.279 

and<00:04:25.949> if<00:04:26.460> you're<00:04:26.610> having<00:04:26.639> troubles<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.449> Sadie

and if you're having troubles with Sadie

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.230 
and if you're having troubles with Sadie
Anna<00:04:28.470> or<00:04:28.740> if<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.100> loader<00:04:29.310> comes<00:04:29.610> up<00:04:29.789> blank<00:04:30.000> it

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
Anna or if the loader comes up blank it

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.430 
Anna or if the loader comes up blank it
just<00:04:30.389> means<00:04:30.539> there's<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.870> whole<00:04:31.080> bunch<00:04:31.350> of

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
just means there's a whole bunch of

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.860 
just means there's a whole bunch of
people<00:04:31.500> trying<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.610> jailbreak<00:04:33.150> their<00:04:33.539> devices

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
people trying to jailbreak their devices

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.469 
people trying to jailbreak their devices
at<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.199> same<00:04:34.289> time<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:35.460> most<00:04:36.030> likely<00:04:36.150> this

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
at the same time but most likely this

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.499 
at the same time but most likely this
won't<00:04:36.780> happen<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:38.550> did<00:04:38.789> happen<00:04:38.940> for<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> Mac

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
won't happen it did happen for the Mac

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.520 
won't happen it did happen for the Mac
version<00:04:39.539> because<00:04:40.110> there<00:04:40.259> are<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.350> lot<00:04:40.500> of

people<00:04:40.650> waiting<00:04:40.979> for<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:42.169> they<00:04:43.169> seem<00:04:43.470> to

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
people waiting for it but they seem to

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.779 
people waiting for it but they seem to
