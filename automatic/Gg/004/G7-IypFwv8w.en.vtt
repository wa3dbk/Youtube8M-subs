00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.449
 in individuals as in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 a lot of arts in agde the spring 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.940
 comes the period of foaling or arad 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 niasse land specialized in horses 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 Iberian it's also the guy is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.410
 the year 2015 is rather prolific 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 since three foals are already but 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.620
 they only have a few days 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 a few hours and gambols already in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850
 meadow alongside their mother 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.810
 in fact all this little world at the stables 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 at the end of the day finally less 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:06.600
 difficult you could imagine everything 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 the world at mom but the day 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.800
 may not be completely complete 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.570
 indeed men are waiting for you too 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.510
 happy event and things get 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.580
 specify finally could we say since 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.360
 his foal should have been born here a 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 fortnight 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.920
 but not too much stress at the stud where 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 we start to get used to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.470
 18 foaling experience nothing to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 see with the first time the 1st 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.869
 pauline age is actually it was setenta 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 it was this mare c and that was if we 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.500
 can tell my mare that I'm riding 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 regularly 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 it was my daughter whom I put to her 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.369
 stature of foaling I think two months 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.509
 to the advanced because we had never 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.970
 no longer there we did not know very well 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.850
 how does it work and and I think these 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.380
 read all the onlookers of the month low 3,4 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.720
 times per night necessarily 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 and when he was born my past was a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.440
 extraordinary event the emotion in 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270
 more because it was my mare have 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.670
 the experience is also that now we 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.459
 is much more serene and is left 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 go 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:11.580
 iman tamp down the last apolline and she 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.860
 is a bit out of time but that's 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.380
 in principle she can hold back again 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.050
 fifteen days after the scheduled date 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.870
 so we just put him the belt of 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.800
 foal that is to say that as soon as the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.890
 mare lying 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.209
 a certain amount of time the belt 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.400
 sounds on the gsm 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.099
 we are awake so we 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 let's go up and we come to see in principle 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.220
 are there any warning signs? 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.569
 the breasts are very big there is 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.299
 wax as we say so there are some 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.480
 little white caps the back but 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.799
 becomes very very soft but hey there are 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.200
 mares that do not show signs 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.700
 who pauline very quickly we go out almost 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.269
 warn us so it's always very 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.459
 difficult 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.230
 the advantage that we condemn mare 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.739
 now they still did 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.599
 all several foals so we see I 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.939
 mean even to their eyes finally there are 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.170
 a lot of signs that tell us that 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.170
 it's going to be the right time 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.530
 the right moment but not right now the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.410
 night fell on the stud and everything is 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.390
 calm a situation that will not last 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.450
 because a few hours later things 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.240
 are going to rush into the fight tank 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.800
 no false alarms 7 x men ta 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.810
 started work and even though everything is going 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.660
 okay a little comfort does not 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.270
 no harm to the mare the contractions 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.690
 succeed each other until the moment 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.690
 magical 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.090
 released from the skin in which she is 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.010
 thought noble opened them eyes for 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:05.790
 the first time and does not take long to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:07.290
 to manifest his presence even your 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.800
 she that her job is not yet 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.900
 completed 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.150
 in addition to cleaning her foal she 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.100
 stimulating the pinesan so that they 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.960
 get up as soon as possible do not 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.580
 Wheat has about two 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.640
 hours for tt the first time and 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.660
 ingesting the essential colostrum for 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.190
 his future immune system is 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.870
 after about an hour as the foals 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.880
 usually gets up but nobility to 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.010
 she decided to take her time 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.850
 but the minutes pass and the delay 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.620
 limit get closer decision is making 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.970
 so give him a little bit of 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.130
 hand but once on these four legs 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.870
 in a precarious balance the path of 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.970
 udders still looks like a 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.380
 labyrinth for the new born who will end 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.740
 all the same by finding what he 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.740
 sought 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.340
 accomplished mission everyone can get 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.740
 go back a few hours to 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.490
 recover from those intense moments menzah 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.490
 first 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.590
 four hours that will lead to paulinet and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.629
 everyone is doing well 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.979
 nob has found its marks and has already 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.110
 nothing to do with the foal 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.789
 clumsy night after the first 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.069
 body care which will already be the 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.250
 discovery of the meadow at a time 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.250
 delicate 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.310
 the first bet is always a 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.419
 not very delicate because there is the 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.669
 change of soil and the limit is 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.800
 that the foal no longer scared because he 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.930
 there's the straw let's go on the concrete going 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.990
 there are pebbles and that's right 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.220
 which is a bit complicated but otherwise they 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.220
 take very exotic face 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.370
 good 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.139
 and that's the mission is accomplished for 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.160
 this year four beautiful chickens and wants 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.070
 now it's a new adventure 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.320
 who starts 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.720
 it will be the work and the masters at 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.990
 better possible for them to go into 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.330
 a good house 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.330
 here we go 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.810
