liked<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> figured<00:00:56.670> let's<00:00:57.180> use<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
liked it so I figured let's use it in a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
liked it so I figured let's use it in a
cocktail<00:00:58.170> normally<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> would<00:00:59.250> call<00:00:59.640> for

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
cocktail normally this would call for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630

culantro<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> Cointreau<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
culantro so you can use a Cointreau if

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.680 
culantro so you can use a Cointreau if
you've<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> wouldn't<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> don't
