I pretty much saves us from being me
being<00:04:29.280> just<00:04:29.490> saying<00:04:29.640> it's<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.850> bit<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.090> rupture

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590

um<00:04:31.590> definitely<00:04:32.100> also<00:04:32.610> those<00:04:32.760> little

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
um definitely also those little

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.700 
um definitely also those little
baseplate<00:04:33.390> army<00:04:33.660> base<00:04:33.810> plates<00:04:34.050> or<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.560> little

can<00:04:37.890> see<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.100> meanings<00:04:38.520> for<00:04:38.670> something

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
can see the meanings for something

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.200 
can see the meanings for something
eventually<00:04:39.300> um<00:04:40.400> they<00:04:41.400> also<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.760> slew<00:04:42.180> of

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
eventually um they also have a slew of
