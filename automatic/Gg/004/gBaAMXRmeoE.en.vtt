00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
free not that I particularly want to do

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
free not that I particularly want to do
that<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.590> always<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:28.890> buy<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> second<00:02:29.520> we

that I can always just buy a second we
but<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.940> think<00:02:30.120> that's<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.330> little<00:02:30.420> excessive

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
but I think that's a little excessive

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.660 
but I think that's a little excessive
maybe<00:02:32.540> anyway<00:02:33.540> um<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:35.010> other<00:02:35.040> exciting<00:02:35.370> thing

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
maybe anyway um the other exciting thing

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.360 
maybe anyway um the other exciting thing
and<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> reason<00:02:36.150> I'm<00:02:36.240> making<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.630> pack<00:02:36.900> this

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
and the reason I'm making this pack this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.010 
and the reason I'm making this pack this
video<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> first<00:02:38.790> place<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.360> actually

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
video in the first place is actually

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.410 
video in the first place is actually
because<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> got<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> package<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.880> saw<00:02:42.240> when

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because I got a package that I saw when

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.850 
because I got a package that I saw when
I<00:02:42.480> came<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.020> door<00:02:43.170> when<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.500> got<00:02:43.710> home
