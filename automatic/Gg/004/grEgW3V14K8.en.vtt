species<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.500> mutation<00:02:33.310> where<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.120> got<00:02:34.450> them

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
species the mutation where I got them

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.080 
species the mutation where I got them
the<00:02:35.290> gender<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.130> then<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> Latin<00:02:36.640> name

the only reason I have those is that way

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.470 
the only reason I have those is that way
if<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.190> say<00:02:42.370> you're<00:02:42.520> breeding<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:43.090> had<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.330> do

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
if you say you're breeding I had to do

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.100 
if you say you're breeding I had to do
is<00:02:44.220> move<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.370> over<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.030> females<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:48.550> yeah

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
is move it over to the females and yeah

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.630 
is move it over to the females and yeah
that's<00:02:50.110> pretty<00:02:50.290> much<00:02:50.410> how<00:02:50.680> my<00:02:50.830> setups<00:02:51.190> go<00:02:51.370> for

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
that's pretty much how my setups go for

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.660 
that's pretty much how my setups go for
a<00:02:51.850> majority<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.600> mice<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:52.989> Boas<00:02:53.650> even<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
a majority of mice and Boas even the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.040 
a majority of mice and Boas even the
adults<00:02:55.000> are<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.239> kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.570> just<00:02:55.840> a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
adults are just kind of that just a
