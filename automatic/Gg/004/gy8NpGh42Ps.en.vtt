00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 so we have a broken iphone 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.319
 home button 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.690
 no, it does nâ€™t seem like iphone is something we 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.690
 celebrate 5 iphone 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:25.500
 Further, we see the home button in any 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.490
 does not want to work with not responding 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.570
 20 years at once picks up something must be done 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.090
 with either throwing the phone away or mending 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.180
 either somehow it is difficult to solve the problem 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.780
 solve by means of the operating system i 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.730
 then go to the settings we find the main 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.730
 there is universal access 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 here the wasteland is not translated and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 the name we turn on now will load it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 some emulation of the home button and something else 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.659
 when you click on it here 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 A choice of four options is offered. 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 one of which which is the desired 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.509
 button and the convenience of this thing is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.820
 in that it is visible in all of them 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 applications is only to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.549
 certain parts of the screen and in general 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.920
 makes it difficult to work play and so on 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.979
 let's see how it looks 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.979
 horrible 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.979
 run 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.790
 and so then play 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.610
 so here's the level you don't even like 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.850
 scary yes with them is a video that's when 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.100
 you play you can get pounded on the button 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.110
 home home and turn off even like this 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.010
 general thing uncomfortable and now we have it 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.670
 turned off so she bothers me more 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.470
 problem solving is installing jailbreak 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.600
 and after this special program 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.700
 here we select the activator everywhere 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:35.470
 then somewhere in the depths we find 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 touch the window and and how many set up 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.510
 so fashionable here you need to turn on the button 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.590
 home imitation keystroke home all 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.880
 thereafter 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.329
 how to tick the home button 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.790
 works when such a window appears 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:57.000
 if click on it works exactly 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.959
 com pressing goes to plus or minus 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.959
 increase or decrease the volume 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.420
 here, to anyone like plus or minus 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:16.060
 works great much more convenient than 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:18.790
 ladies, the only thing is that if you open the player 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.609
 directly the player itself is a system here 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:28.120
 intercepts control of buttons 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.519
 they went off to adjust the volume and they 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.100
 the hill no longer works but if 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.100
 get out of here will continue to work 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.540
 so here is the work
