00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.660
 sometimes the past haunts us 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 like a ghost wandering aimlessly seeking its place 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.760
 it is not even in this one 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.710
 while the other world 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.710
 he is simply caught between two dimensions 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.880
 the 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.880
 uu 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
 min he edil 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430
 there was no 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310
 they fall 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.319
 I always thought that man's life had become too monotonous 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.120
 too vulgar 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 too predictable 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 I myself felt comfortable living a calm and convinced life 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.920
 but even these people added 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 about these people 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.500
 since that day my life changed 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.680
 the memory continues until today interrupting the deep sleep of 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.070
 every morning 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.820
 But it's not just that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 there was something more 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 for some reason 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.920
 the event they make the mistake of looking for a transcendental change in my life 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 since it is far from creating a feeling of fear and insecurity 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.180
 I believe in a kind of hope 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.180
 let's say that motivated me to leave 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.719
 I did not want to be like all those people who walk the streets with their eyes 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.369
 turned off and exhorted his thoughts 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.369
 waiting for the traffic lights to show the way 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.379
 he liked it was something different 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.349
 blame all the ills of this city 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.349
 find a way to follow a path different from others 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.549
 involution agreement for the improvement of skills rooted by our 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.149
 ancestors 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:45.159
 but in turn evolve the mind to create the perfect balance 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.879
 dulko alimentary habits 1st 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.369
 We think so 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 my goal was to become a kind of hero 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.359
 Mexico DF 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.999
 a real hero 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.599
 a hero who is maybe would not be able to eradicate crime he asserted 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.689
 that at least try to go to the bar here could 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.549
 ii to take the first step I decided to start with the father of my new life 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.959
 the investiture before 17 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.959
 the desert 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.689
 the only bad thing was that 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.689
 he told me to play the superhero was something easy 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.899
 life gives many opportunities at the moment you know what will end 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.419
 the 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.569
 i think about my case 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.569
 he will not be able to play anymore, it was learned from him 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.360
