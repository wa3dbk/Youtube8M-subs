up<00:00:18.800> you<00:00:19.369> can<00:00:19.550> move<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.270> C<00:00:20.450> on

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
up you can move the C on

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.750 
up you can move the C on
up<00:00:22.190> and<00:00:22.340> down<00:00:22.520> as<00:00:22.700> you<00:00:22.730> see<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:23.810> we<00:00:24.500> have<00:00:24.680> the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
up and down as you see it so we have the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.280 
up and down as you see it so we have the
x-ray<00:00:25.760> tube<00:00:25.940> at<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.150> bottom<00:00:26.450> right<00:00:26.630> now<00:00:26.660> and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
x-ray tube at the bottom right now and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.190 
x-ray tube at the bottom right now and
the<00:00:27.650> image<00:00:27.860> intensifier<00:00:28.550> at<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.820> top<00:00:29.200> once

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
the image intensifier at the top once

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.019 
the image intensifier at the top once
you<00:00:30.350> establish<00:00:31.040> where<00:00:31.279> you'd<00:00:31.430> like<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:31.850> have

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
you establish where you'd like to have

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.610 
you establish where you'd like to have
it<00:00:32.239> you<00:00:32.689> can<00:00:32.840> lock<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:33.230> in

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
it you can lock it in

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.130 
it you can lock it in
there's<00:00:34.520> come<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.910> usually<00:00:35.300> being<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.630> table

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
there's come to usually being a table

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.680 
there's come to usually being a table
that<00:00:36.920> could<00:00:37.220> see<00:00:37.400> our<00:00:37.520> table<00:00:37.940> in<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.420> middle

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
that could see our table in the middle

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.080 
that could see our table in the middle
where<00:00:38.900> a<00:00:39.199> patient<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.190> either<00:00:40.340> problem<00:00:40.879> or

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
where a patient is either problem or

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.960 
where a patient is either problem or
supply<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.530> top<00:00:42.770> of<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.790> image

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
supply so the top of the image

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.479 
supply so the top of the image
intensifier<00:00:44.600> an<00:00:44.870> effort<00:00:45.199> to<00:00:45.350> would<00:00:45.890> be<00:00:45.920> around

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
intensifier an effort to would be around

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.720 
intensifier an effort to would be around
the<00:00:46.850> table<00:00:47.030> which<00:00:47.420> sits<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.199> middle<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
the table which sits in the middle the

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.750 
the table which sits in the middle the
nest<00:00:49.970> next<00:00:50.449> aspect<00:00:50.900> of<00:00:51.230> movements<00:00:51.769> is<00:00:51.980> this

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
nest next aspect of movements is this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.790 
nest next aspect of movements is this
lever<00:00:53.030> here<00:00:53.360> which<00:00:53.390> will<00:00:54.020> turn<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.290> syrop

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
lever here which will turn the syrop

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.389 
lever here which will turn the syrop
left<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.940> right<00:00:56.149> as<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:56.510> see

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
left to right as you see

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.740 
left to right as you see
so<00:00:58.399> basically<00:00:58.730> we're<00:00:58.910> able<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.149> turn<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.450> C<00:00:59.630> on

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
so basically we're able to turn the C on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.410 
so basically we're able to turn the C on
just<00:00:59.989> about<00:01:00.200> upside-down<00:01:01.160> as<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.940> can<00:01:02.090> see<00:01:02.329> it

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
just about upside-down as you can see it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.590 
just about upside-down as you can see it
as<00:01:03.140> well<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:05.649> once<00:01:06.649> again

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.980 

slightly<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> bigger<00:01:11.869> once<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
slightly as you see it bigger once you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.100 
slightly as you see it bigger once you
get<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> condition<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.460> together

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
get in condition you want well together

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
get in condition you want well together
and<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.470> lock<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.580> lock<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and you can lock it in here and lock it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.560 
and you can lock it in here and lock it
in<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.950> as<00:01:19.950> well<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.729> heads<00:01:21.060> motor

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
in here as well it is heads motor
