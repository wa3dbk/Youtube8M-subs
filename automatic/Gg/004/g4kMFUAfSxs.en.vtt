00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.180
 hey people today i introduce you my 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.920
 Face care routine before first 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.719
 I take my hair rubber and make me 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.250
 my hair from the face easy 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.670
 so that you do not wash at night 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.670
 become 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.880
 Of course, I'll show you mine now 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.690
 beautiful hairstyle still from behind 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 Do you want a tutorial to a nonsense 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.520
 I start my hands first 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.080
 to wash that is very important because I 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.880
 my hands then in the face 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.660
 So that's why they have to be right 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.660
 to be clean 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.270
 Now I take my washing gel and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.060
 my clear sonic at hand a clear one 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.860
 Sonic is a rotating face 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.540
 only brush my works 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.309
 electrics no longer that's why it's just 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.110
 still a normal face brush 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 and I'm mine first 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.640
 face a bit damp and then of course 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.640
 also brush my face and give 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 on it then my washing gel the betrayed 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 I then just brush it like that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 seems and then somehow also some 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.070
 I turn my face into circular 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.810
 movements 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.780
 I completely changed to the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.240
 care series of florena with green tea 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 and rice for mixed skin because I'm in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 Lately many pimples had these 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.520
 facial care series has the whole thing 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 again pretty well in the handle 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.630
 I think it irritates my skin 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.430
 not at all but it marks them 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.509
 also and as I said my pimples are 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.060
 also got better 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.399
 also should in the care series no 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.950
 artificial colors mineral oils 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.080
 be included silicones or pgs 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.240
 and I think that's pretty good, too 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.039
 I only use the facial brush in the evening 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.630
 I did not make a little make up 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.520
 I really think so 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.830
 make up and out of my pore again 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.170
 the face is deeply cleansed though 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.549
 I only take my hands in the morning 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.990
 to wash my face 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.729
 and when I'm done with it 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.720
 I just dry my face with 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.720
 a towel off 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 Remains of mascara or kajal 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.420
 I remove something similar with mine 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.540
 face cleansing water from bio derma 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.000
 I give something on a waterbed 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.800
 and clean my eyes with it 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.959
 I just shade those black ones 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.690
 you have been including still finds 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.640
 can remove 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.890
 the facial cleansing water of bio the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 with micellar solution is really great 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.660
 good for sensitive skin because 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.590
 it very gently retains makeup and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.590
 dirt removed from the skin 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.220
 for my face namely one more time 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.070
 a face water again from 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.840
 the same care series from florena and 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.489
 I'll give that back to a waterbed 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.580
 and clean mine with it again 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.290
 face my neck and my decollete 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.420
 This facial water contains alcohol 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.430
 therefore you have to be careful if 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.650
 you really have very sensitive skin 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.050
 I really like it because it is 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.180
 the skin also matted by the alcohol 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.400
 and of course dry pimples 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.500
 but as I said you have to 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.549
 be careful with 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.320
 alcoholic care products 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.900
 Now I'm only going to finish 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.880
 my florena mattifying day cream 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.980
 that it's the same care series again 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.780
 I really like this cream very much 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.700
 and yes, I just distribute it in 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.620
 my face in my neck in something 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.390
 at my decollete and definitely 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.190
 the cream should also mark the skin 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.630
 what i can confirm i find mine 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.420
 skin does not so much grease after 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.100
 as before and I find the cream 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.410
 also provides sufficient moisture 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.320
 that I have no suspense on the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.480
 that would have been my skin 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.890
 complete face care routine 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.420
 you see, I'm actually doing now 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.640
 not very much and take too 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.980
 not thousands of products because I think 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.079
 sometimes less is more special too 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.280
 when it comes to facial care and me 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.019
 hope you have a nice day 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.019
 and see you next time
