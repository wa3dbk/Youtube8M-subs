00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
summer it's just just like putting a

give them a shade the extra water and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.650 
give them a shade the extra water and
they<00:01:28.920> could<00:01:29.160> stand<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> long<00:01:30.270> time

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
they could stand there for a long time

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.050 
they could stand there for a long time
doing<00:01:30.929> that<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.410> that's<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.429> can<00:01:32.610> try<00:01:32.819> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
doing that so that's you can try that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.430 
doing that so that's you can try that
now<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.810> other<00:01:33.929> way<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> course<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.069> get

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
now the other way of course is to get

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.430 
now the other way of course is to get
heat<00:01:37.459> resistant<00:01:38.459> plants<00:01:39.229> now<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.380> do

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
heat resistant plants now they do

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.249 
heat resistant plants now they do
breathe<00:01:40.950> lettuces<00:01:41.789> and<00:01:42.209> many<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.959> plants

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
breathe lettuces and many of the plants

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.309 
breathe lettuces and many of the plants
for<00:01:43.590> either<00:01:44.060> stand<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.209> cold<00:01:45.390> weather<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.050> the

for either stand the cold weather or the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.010 
for either stand the cold weather or the
warm<00:01:46.560> weather<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.239> in<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.539> case<00:01:48.810> you'd

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
warm weather and so in this case you'd

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
warm weather and so in this case you'd
want<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.349> get<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.739> lettuce<00:01:50.160> varieties<00:01:50.459> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
say our heat tolerant or summer tolerant

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.930 
say our heat tolerant or summer tolerant
and<00:01:55.080> they<00:01:55.470> won't<00:01:55.739> both<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.190> see<00:01:56.429> it<00:01:56.489> as<00:01:56.670> fast

traditionally<00:02:35.910> corn<00:02:36.540> has<00:02:36.690> grown<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.230> single

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
traditionally corn has grown in single

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.130 
traditionally corn has grown in single
rows<00:02:37.880> spaced<00:02:38.880> three<00:02:39.300> feet<00:02:39.510> apart

that's<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:40.770> farm<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.610> way<00:02:41.910> then<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that's all farm so that way then that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600 
that's all farm so that way then that
way<00:02:42.870> since<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.320> caveman<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.890> think<00:02:44.130> corn

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
way since the caveman I think corn

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.470 
way since the caveman I think corn
pollinates

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
pollinates

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.760 
pollinates
when<00:02:45.990> corn<00:02:46.350> comes<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:46.950> mmm<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> stalk<00:02:49.530> goes

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
when corn comes up mmm the stalk goes

when corn comes up mmm the stalk goes
all<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.010> way<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.250> top<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.570> there<00:02:51.810> are

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
all the way to top and then there are

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.699 
all the way to top and then there are
tassels<00:02:52.320> there<00:02:53.060> now<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.780> male<00:02:55.170> pollen

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
tassels there now that's the male pollen

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.370 
tassels there now that's the male pollen
is<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.400> those<00:02:56.580> tassels<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.480> when<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.170> wind

blows and the corn shakes or moves they
fall<00:03:02.400> down<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.330> wind<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.660> blowing

fall down now if the wind is blowing
they<00:03:04.320> fall<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.890> way<00:03:05.130> now<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.390> plant<00:03:06.750> corn

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
they fall this way now if you plant corn

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.620 
they fall this way now if you plant corn
in<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.410> single<00:03:07.830> row<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.970> pollen<00:03:09.390> falls

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
in a single row and the pollen falls

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.800 
in a single row and the pollen falls
this<00:03:09.959> way<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.190> ear<00:03:11.550> with<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:11.970> silk<00:03:12.510> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
this way and the ear with the silk is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.140 
this way and the ear with the silk is
over<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.709> doesn't<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.459> pollinated<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
over here doesn't get pollinated and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.910 
over here doesn't get pollinated and
that's<00:03:15.660> sometimes<00:03:15.930> when<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.620> an<00:03:16.739> ear<00:03:16.890> of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
that's sometimes when you get an ear of

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.300 
that's sometimes when you get an ear of
corn<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.580> there<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.000> missing<00:03:18.390> kernels<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
corn and there are missing kernels in it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.000 
corn and there are missing kernels in it
because<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> interesting<00:03:21.150> thing<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.660> that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
because the interesting thing is that

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.870 
because the interesting thing is that
the<00:03:23.010> pollen<00:03:23.519> comes<00:03:23.850> down<00:03:24.150> onto<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.610> silk<00:03:26.610> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
the pollen comes down onto the silk and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.720 
the pollen comes down onto the silk and
there's<00:03:27.510> one<00:03:28.140> strand<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.769> silk<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.400> every

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
there's one strand of silk for every

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.600 
there's one strand of silk for every
kernel<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.720> goes<00:03:30.989> inside<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:32.100> into<00:03:32.580> a

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
kernel that goes inside and into a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.699 
kernel that goes inside and into a
kernel<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.360> if<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.870> doesn't<00:03:34.049> get<00:03:34.290> pollinated

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
kernel and if it doesn't get pollinated

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.710 
kernel and if it doesn't get pollinated
that<00:03:35.160> kernel<00:03:35.580> won't<00:03:35.760> fill<00:03:36.030> out<00:03:36.180> right<00:03:36.420> but

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that kernel won't fill out right but

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.050 
that kernel won't fill out right but
that<00:03:37.410> shows<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.100> best<00:03:38.370> way<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.640> plant

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060
