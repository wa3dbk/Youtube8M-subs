like<00:02:18.950> 3rd<00:02:19.220> gear<00:02:19.430> fast<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.209> can<00:02:20.360> start

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
like 3rd gear fast because you can start

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.479 
like 3rd gear fast because you can start

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
to get traction in third gear first and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.370 
to get traction in third gear first and
second<00:02:22.940> really<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.720> can't<00:02:23.870> put<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> power

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
second really you can't put the power

i'm using about one gear hire and i

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.280 
i'm using about one gear hire and i
would<00:03:57.969> think<00:03:58.180> would<00:03:58.420> be<00:03:58.540> appropriate<00:03:58.629> but

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
would think would be appropriate but

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:07.179 
would think would be appropriate but
that's<00:03:59.439> just<00:03:59.590> soon<00:03:59.829> as<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.099> kitchen<00:04:00.549> torch

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.630 

the<00:04:08.189> suspension<00:04:08.790> works<00:04:08.999> really<00:04:09.239> nicely

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:41.140 

and

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.130 

really<00:04:43.580> just<00:04:44.580> rip<00:04:44.910> when<00:04:45.480> they<00:04:45.600> do<00:04:45.660> slide

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
really just rip when they do slide
