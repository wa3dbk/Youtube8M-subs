cancer in this organs ultrasound is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.600 
cancer in this organs ultrasound is
simply<00:00:38.730> sound<00:00:39.000> waves<00:00:39.860> they're<00:00:40.860> associated

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
simply sound waves they're associated

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
simply sound waves they're associated
with<00:00:41.640> frequencies<00:00:42.480> about<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> audible<00:00:43.590> range

and generally extend upward 20 kilohertz

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
and generally extend upward 20 kilohertz
thus<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> ultrasound<00:00:49.440> refers<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> sound

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
thus the ultrasound refers to sound

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.910 
thus the ultrasound refers to sound
