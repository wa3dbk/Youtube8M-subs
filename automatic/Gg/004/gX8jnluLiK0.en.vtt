00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.090
 the day by day in the stretch that is running 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 ends up finding the lot of things 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 always transport always transport is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.239
 Good because we stayed here has nothing to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.120
 he is making today the opzz 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 truck was a habit of training and now 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.149
 already changed to rodotrem is on horseback 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.149
 mechanical 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 I have scania has the flight has two 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.850
 paths here moved all Angelus is this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 here goes for a formula truck goes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
 be part of one of an event that you 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.579
 Make this way look at changing everything 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 started with a joke, huh? 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.439
 This truck here is the same truck. 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 with my father had been what I learned 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.770
 to drive was a scanner like this one 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.780
 joão de barro gabinha 69 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 the year of its manufacture which is equal to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.979
 What did my father have? 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.590
 there was an opportunity to buy 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.960
 he we restored it todinho 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 then my brother in law was the farm that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.040
 people started well came as a joke 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.470
 that the brother- in- law paulo wedges in 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.119
 São Paulo has already had 40 in a bat 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.540
 I sometimes talk that he is 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.090
 rural producer and also transport can 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 be done in a farm for what 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.560
 I wanted to make an average with my brother-in-law, it's not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 in fact my brother needs all this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 I also gilberto that his brother-in-law 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 but have been raised together since 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.829
 since we were born since we were born 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.439
 we are together 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.020
 although we are the same age right now 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.340
 one thing now one thing you made one 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.619
 here for companies since 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 we do events that you do then 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.790
 We made it drift, you do not have maneuvers. 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.130
 radicals 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.500
 the track is lowered one and a half meters from the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.319
 level of the population is not 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.450
 with several fire extinguishers and everything and everything 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.920
 is used with safety equipment to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.080
 have public security 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 and for the pilot now explains special 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.180
 which is the dfi the drift are very motors 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.090
 strong with strong cars with pilots 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.640
 tossed and slipped out and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.530
 melting the tire down the track and 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.230
 house a tractor truck in the valley to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.760
 car truck tractor aerial maneuvers already 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.430
 we also had a new airline too 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.190
 they were all exporters and not crazy when 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.950
 You're on the truck board . 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.489
 Which leads to this one from here, yes? 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.400
 another roso to work right this is it 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.750
 It's not now , it was not for that. 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.170
 for this purpose 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.610
 So I came here for a weekend with him. 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.680
 understood sent to play the people 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.459
 It's all good, right? It's different from the car. 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.980
 huh 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.640
 is a snoring motor is stronger the tire 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.670
 sings more beautiful , smoke rises there 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.290
 people liked and are every event that 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.019
 has people walk with him is being a 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.060
 success 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.250
 never hit here hit the union give a 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.519
 Damn injury is this one here now 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.459
 Stop this from here, I just went here. 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.650
 that will stay in place of that was 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.790
 his first now this event now 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 and that here the good over here summed up the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.959
 story was the inauguration of it only that 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.470
 he broke 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.700
 here the other gold here the people of my 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 people his father is this is a long time 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.650
 to work with load performance like 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.440
 to amaze him was was to put the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.970
 Why I've been traveling with him for a long time. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.250
 learning, did not have a wallet yet? 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.400
 then later I bought the agent who acquires 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.920
 another 111 as well and evolved with 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.840
 time right here in the old area you 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.430
 Can you grow as a transporter? 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.950
 thing that we have running today 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.660
 Look, I'm hanging around with only eight trucks. 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.910
 that I'm selling I'm going to be alone with 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 five with only the nine axes that we 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.959
 We are having a very difficult time. 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.510
 great with the driver is the driver 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.310
 is the bitrem want or not want and 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.169
 takes less - freight or billing is - 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.970
 and the paths we have for nine 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.480
 axles are the most modern trucks 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.390
 so his travel time to do 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.300
 You have to stop to rest right then 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.990
 is it comes almost together with the other and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.800
 wins in more but is the future to pay 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.920
 more 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.150
 You can pay more than you get more, right? 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.950
 to close here to play 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.480
 you have this event here you are here 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.250
 a private property 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.070
 This six DVD makes him here is 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.820
 private and brings people here to pay 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.190
 ticket 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.470
 this is particular we did because the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.260
 people even like sport business 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.700
 automotive and also the sport of 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.600
 motoring right 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.640
 and we charge a ticket is always 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.100
 10 15 20 reais depending on the type of 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.600
 event that is né and part of the income of the 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.450
 box office is intended for 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.040
 charities is one thing. 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.930
 What do you like because you're the producer? 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.520
 transporter and likes income 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.220
 I really like the whole family. 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.690
 a lot of Taiwanese events where there were 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.490
 quick just to talk a little bit about 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.530
 paulo silvy that only has a difference 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 in fact to relax a little 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.190
 here in luis eduardo magalhães that these 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.020
 paths are prepared for this but 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.830
 ensures that the neighbor where he learned 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.810
 to drive 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.950
 there the day to day in the stretch being that 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.950
 Luis Eduardo for all Brazil
