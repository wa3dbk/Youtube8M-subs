00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.330
 europe i want europe i love europe 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 and yet I desperately want to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.800
 europe and now suing for example the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.019
 pair French eu commissioner within 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.099
 For example, each of them is planning 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.920
 privatization of the public 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.690
 water supply in Europe too 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.210
 water is still easier 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 Public good a common good though 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 that should change, yes, the corporations 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.789
 are already in line it is about one 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.220
 billion by double digits 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 but the lord ballack we yield 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 Do not be afraid that the water 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.070
 becomes more expensive or worse because he says so 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.430
 the market will then be the judge 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 market hey water water is life water 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 is a human right water is one 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 public property and property 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.250
 is committed in German 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 constitution and the use of the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 Property should probably be the one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.750
 serve universality is also in the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 constitution and if the water is no 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.920
 public property is more but 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.039
 the hand of any 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.289
 joint-stock companies 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 then you may be very curious whom 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.530
 a publicly traded company on the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 the end feels more obligated 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.350
 the general or the well his 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.989
 shareholders 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 and he noticed and 80 percent at all 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 the europeans do not want private 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.020
 water supply and still they want 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 europe and no borders and none 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.670
 war and no shit nazis but you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.439
 They want to leave the water and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 you want work and good work and am 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.570
 sit in the sun and play and lady 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.670
 to cultivate your prejudices 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.290
 and if she fails, if europe fails 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.369
 may not fail at the euro 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.780
 and then maybe also fails even 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.549
 not that the europeans in the bokle 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.200
 have on europe but if europe 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.570
 Failures may just fail 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.750
 that the europeans are just kidding more 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.520
 do not have on any 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 Democratically elected EU commissioners 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.610
 shit yourself from any money 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.649
 Lobbyists during their visit in Brussels 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.759
 let a rain that the market already 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.759
 everything will be judged 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.860
 in front 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.600
 i want europe and i like europe 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.479
 great and I think it's great 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 that there is something like European 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.119
 citizen initiatives and a European one 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 citizen initiative wants exactly that now 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.870
 prevent privatization 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.220
 of the water and who need to 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.510
 autumn one million votes 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.470
 and then it does not have it yet 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.209
 But I have to stop that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.950
 new commission and deal with it 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.270
 Now I wanted the internet address 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.270

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.770

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.110
 the reputable public law 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.690
 Unfortunately, senders are not allowed private or 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.910
 foreign internet addresses a dazzling 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.860
 there is no censorship and no evil will there 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.230
 But there are no laws for me 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.630
 problem because it is so in the serious 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.550
 public broadcasters at all 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.810
