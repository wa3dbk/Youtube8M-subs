when<00:00:22.300> we<00:00:22.420> moved<00:00:22.660> into<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.990> building<00:00:23.110> we

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
when we moved into the building we

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.590 
when we moved into the building we
realized<00:00:24.160> that<00:00:24.280> we<00:00:24.400> had<00:00:24.490> weak<00:00:24.910> signal<00:00:25.360> in<00:00:25.480> the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
realized that we had weak signal in the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.929 
realized that we had weak signal in the
first<00:00:25.840> floor<00:00:26.080> in<00:00:26.260> the<00:00:26.350> lower<00:00:26.530> level<00:00:26.890> we<00:00:27.580> had<00:00:27.730> no

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
signal in most of the lower level so we

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.950 
signal in most of the lower level so we
wanted<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.730> boost<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.180> signal<00:00:31.330> so<00:00:31.720> we<00:00:31.750> could

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
wanted to boost the signal so we could

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.990
