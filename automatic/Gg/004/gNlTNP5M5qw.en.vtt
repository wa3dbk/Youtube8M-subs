00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.360
 it was again so far emsdetten stood before 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.550
 his next home game was guest 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.680
 the thsv eisenach very much to this 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.840
 time the fourth table place in 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.060
 The league had wanted to Eisenach 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.670
 they would score a good one 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.470
 step direction league one can do 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.660
 accordingly were many fans 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.760
 the blue traveled around her team 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.579
 to assist in the ems hall 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.320
 captain also motivates her 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.210
 wanted the rough defeat of 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 make up for it 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.010
 but so far undefeated at home and 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.460
 after all, had proved that one 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.930
 could beat ascent aspirants 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.420
 This was the latest after the game 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.730
 against questioning field it was spoken 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.610
 So to become an exciting game 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.059
 the tv emsdetten was hard to find 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.350
 game 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.690
 the host's first chance right away 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.420
 was not used tobias revision 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.600
 fails here at stadtlauf group moved 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.330
 the tsv so now the chance on the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.060
 but also no success here 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.340
 Babin as well as his colleague wake up 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.650
 the opposite side less awake contributed 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.049
 binz teammates used these 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.150
 namely your chance not like this 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.520
 he also does not lead to seven meters 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.259
 Success in return could eisenach 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.610
 now enforce number eleven the anja 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.590
 Nitra 4 to zero to 13 minutes now 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.329
 already around and still no hit for 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 emsdetten but also in this experiment 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.290
 did not succeed the fans of the green 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.720
 So had to wait a bit 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.030
 if one does not want to do it then 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.460
 just the other so at least saw 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 is the blue with this hit to 0 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.130
 2 saw it quite good for me 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 eisenach then finally over five 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.840
 minutes succeeded in pushing a ball 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.570
 to score captains hare here 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 with the first goal success for the tv 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.159
 emsdetten after this action seemed 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.729
 emsdetten now found in the game too 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.840
 have gotten stronger 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.299
 within a minute 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.640
 hits like here from folders or too 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:21.920
 by tobia's auditor for a high spirits 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.379
 here in the ems-hall after one 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 good defense performance met video creation 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.480
 to 52 after a two-goal residue 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.030
 now with three goals to be ahead 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.579
 Coach then weird was so satisfied 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.859
 as the fans in the hall Eisenach in 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.470
 At this stage, they found it somewhat perplexed 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.540
 no real solution to the tv too 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.129
 Always stop was four to five 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 gates behind 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.030
 Shortly before closing the tv ii got then 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 again the possibility of leadership 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.349
 but also here is the 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.019
 chance not used this too 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.909
 StrafstoÃŸ does not lead to success now 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.400
 there were only a few seconds left 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.889
 Blue came again and came 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.720
 to succeed only a second later and 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.700
 the hit would not have counted 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.439
 We pity Amstetten for the kind of Germany 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.829
 is then 16 to 12 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.810
 now there were only four hits left 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.699
 because you could be quite satisfied 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.889
 you should not forget about it either 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.109
 Nordhorn was also still ahead 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.569
 and after the second half you stood 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.010
 then with empty hands there for 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.199
 eisenach was definitely clear 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.730
 had to do something but the hit in 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:30.230
 last second gave hope again 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.909
 Passage two strongly recalled the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.280
 Initial phase of the first half 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.169
 emsdetten started again found weak 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.940
 not really back to the game 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.650
 instead of rebuilding the leadership 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.139
 she just swam there 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.209
 tsv coach velimir petkovic knew well 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.220
 there was still something he conducted his 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.780
 guys from the sideline and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.919
 within five minutes it was then 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.560
 eisenach was done again 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:57.049
 Now the game got exciting again 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.389
 the fans of the tsv were fully back 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.819
 now followed their team with all 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.889
 Force had to implement now with all 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.280
 against it they managed to do it 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:09.199
 but not really set off 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.090
 Eisenach still beat it 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.909
 Towards the end it became real 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.549
 exciting here you meet only 71 yards 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.320
 to balance out a short time later again 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.020
 guys to leadership 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.730
 Only a few minutes to play now 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.770
 emsdetten threatened the first 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.830
 home defeat but jesus people that 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.340
 still time comes tor before it meets for its 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.580
 rebalancing on the clock stood 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.440
 but still 5 40 seconds possession 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.740
 eisenach and it comes as feared 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.320
 the tsv scored again 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.880
 the emotions now boiled on emsdetten 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.580
 had only a few seconds left 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.280
 point division by the initial situation 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.470
 almost hopelessly eisenach parried that 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.960
 Tor wanted the two important points 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.700
 Take home after this chance 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.400
 revision is over 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.010
 emsdetten fall bitter now for the tva 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.360
 a little bit happy for eisenach after this 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.890
 tight and highly emotional 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.440
 final phase will be again 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.270
 a bit restless rudelbildung on the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.120
 Spielfeld not the best finish 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.950
 such a wavering handball arms yet 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.270
 So after this moment can not be 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.300
 More celebrating with the travelers 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:22.190
 fans win their victory in the ems hall and the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.630
 second place in the league i 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.860
 I would be dissatisfied today 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.510
 had the opportunity to win 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.250
 exactly the same as in the nordhorn 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.500
 I do not care if the team is fourth 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.300
 is or or tenth or fifteenth 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.500
 if we want to play we win and 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.350
 then you can not be satisfied if 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.350
 one lost but did not use 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.969
 seven reports we have three seven-meter 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:50.270
 I think I can play 2000 shows 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:52.219
 and we also have other chance against 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.599
 such a strong opponent will be punished 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.680
 in the second half we have it 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.930
 not when the first halftime managed 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.069
 as a cover motorcycle and so on 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.060
 the services have the same kind of work 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.039
 can hold high 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.000
 one conceded too many goals and 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.150
 that should break our neck today 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.520
 so i'm generally never happy after 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.349
 defeat but today I am also one 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.240
 a bit proud because we are fine 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:16.719
 presented we hewn everything 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.719
 and can I call on us?
