00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello everyone today I came this way 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.279
 package wrapped 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.290
 which I ordered tasks for a long time but 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.710
 still flew with lenses for nexus 5 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.460
 honestly i haven't opened yet and enough 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 worried because let's explain 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 nexus rim camera this bezel he 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 made magnetized that is to him 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.930
 lean on any metal body 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.340
 we just magnetize it and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.680
 some lenses instead of what 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 magnetized they magnetized from 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.329
 the magician is nothing and that is repelled 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.620
 from this both. 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.630
 I hope with this lens I will not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.860
 Now we will see it on the forum 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.600
 advised this particular package let's 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.600
 let's see what's what 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.789
 everything is packed more than just but 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:59.850
 Essentially this you and not particularly important blood on 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.769
 there is nothing this aside in the kit 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 available how many 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:09.560
 several lenses holders so understand for 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.260
 keys 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.330
 So here for example the lens here on the idea 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.130
 there must be a magnetic base let's 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:32.250
 try to imagine whether the technique will 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:34.439
 on hold on or not as i said 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.979
 from magnetically reversed 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.969
 what is not good we can and the other 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.130
 lens although honestly very doubt 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.969
 rebounds as if nothing had happened 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:56.729
 last hope for some 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:59.070
 transitions that we have this idea 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.960
 stickers that stick to the phone itself 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.350
 in order to subsequently stick 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.829
 magnets on the lens well closely this is an option 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.829
 not for me 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.120
 and then the last something else there is something 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.430
 kept the same cast with extra 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 stickers what is it all about 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 also a magnet 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.370
 Nexus itself is glued but not on camera 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.120
 very interesting general such a book 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.130
 apparently using lenses normally not 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.500
 will come out though maybe something can 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.890
 come up with something came up necessarily 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.370
 take off on this topic video on this on 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.370
 Today, all bye until new meetings
