00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.370
 good morning guys back on the 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.889
 channel today videos with finished products 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.540
 so let's start immediately 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.970
 We have already mentioned these two 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.259
 products we talk about shampoo and conditioner 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.330
 of orÃ©al paris expertise is a color 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.060
 color sublimation system we have 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.789
 both the color moisturizing shampoo 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.789
 shining and balm of the same line 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.670
 and in fact for colored and dry hair 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.590
 then I found I believe mine 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.750
 favorite balm besides that of the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.440
 tg that is when I can't find the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.989
 very famous tgs factor I go to conditioner 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.780
 this here because i find it to be fantastic is 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.089
 ibra as much as it can be 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.430
 moisturizing obviously a balm with i 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.500
 silicones but it's really fantastic of 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.530
 super hyper mega damaged hair 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.790
 this one leaves me soft 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.710
 disciplined easy to comb the 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.780
 even soft when I dry them 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.549
 shampoo is very valid 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.640
 if you see it runs smoothie than in total 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:09.789
 anarchy however used in combo vi 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.630
 leave hair that to say soft and 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:18.369
 really say nothing except this 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.909
 combo the smoothie tip for kids 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.119
 and boys with acute dry hair 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.609
 and precisely because to me this shampoo does not 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.009
 it made the clean hair last so long in the 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.070
 sense that I had to wash them frequently 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.020
 because it is very nutritious therefore amelie 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.369
 goes practically in quotation marks to 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.710
 getting fat anyway makes me fat 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.049
 even faster spaghetti in the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.829
 comfortable in now everyone is comfortable 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.640
 fed up 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:49.659
 I finished this chili mask 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:54.220
 sting organs well maybe lysis angles and that 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.869
 so frizzy hair not covered 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.869
 this closed mask does not have 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.640
 silicone has no parabens it is so much why 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.500
 there is a lot of it there was a lot of it 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.979
 within 250 ml just that sincerely me 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.330
 I need disgust need silicones 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.640
 I need those things there because 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.069
 otherwise in the hair they become horrendous 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.560
 and since the hair is really so much 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.390
 so much treated I need that 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.430
 type of ingredients this does not have them 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.850
 and in fact despite being a mask 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.220
 very dense, very dense it was not in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.470
 so that my hair would take it 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.550
 in quotes the nourishment if you are 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.620
 girls with hair in quotation marks 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.650
 sverginata from silicones and that is that with i 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.900
 pure hair you can try it in my opinion 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.870
 it will affect you when talking about make 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.239
 up I finished my favorite face powder 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.650
 and I'm eating it already 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.079
 once bought another I like them 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.900
 so much derby this is the powder 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.670
 transparent in the sense and white the wafer 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.440
 and it is fantastic in the sense that it dulls 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.680
 very much tends very lightly to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.620
 bleaching then you have to adapt a moment 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.829
 to the complexion therefore for darker skin 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.560
 I do n't know but for us mozzarelli girls 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.230
 this powder derby is photonic we have 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.459
 then of war surpluses in the sense that 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.170
 a product that I have for so many 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.739
 finally I finished the studio fix 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.640
 mac powder this is the No. 3 shade 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.610
 a compact powder foundation I will 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.000
 use as a powder when or gods 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.459
 truly terrifying periods at the level 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.799
 of skin type this type this 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.130
 period otherwise if I resorted to 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.079
 I use this type of products for 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.090
 create a super fast base so i go 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.210
 with a corrector to correct glasses 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.580
 and various discolorations then 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.530
 the face powder like that and apple spa rate 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.840
 in my face and I'm okay 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.750
 this is the key n3 I said praises 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.210
 repurchased however in tone c2 that is 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.820
 decidedly more yellow and because I am 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.650
 really yellow Chinese I don't know though 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.420
 that maybe mincio list too i have to 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.020
 test it a bit like the top finished 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.270
 coat effect jelle volume of collistar 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.570
 absolute favorite top coat and sense 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.580
 that I don't know if it helps so much in sugar and 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.940
 faster though the glaze creates 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.800
 really a super hyper mega effect 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.840
 nail polish to me nails 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.820
 like shiny don't like patios 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.740
 so I've already bought one back like 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.230
 backup me and los between advice that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.920
 talking about mascara finished the hypnosis star 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.680
 of lancom which I liked however from a 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.510
 too much too natural effect 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.060
 to the eyelashes you know that you like them 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.820
 eyelashes exceed fan you have to see 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.310
 this must be to build it a 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.430
 casino and you wo n't be able to 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.590
 reach that wow effect though vi 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.630
 opens the eyes well in the sense that 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.900
 however the fan lashes does it though 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.380
 does not go so much to king engravings and then ho 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.020

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.970
