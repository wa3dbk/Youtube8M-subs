00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello guys do you hear the voice of evil borscht 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.559
 and today I will tell you about two German 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.809
 Fri-Sau 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.779
 who might well be in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 near future on the ninth and tenth 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.980
 levels and so we say thank you 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.439
 Hamish at his channel for giving 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.990
 material and start and the first machine 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 Today has but very beautiful German 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.680
 name gunner jagdancer 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.149
 make when there is no gamer I hope that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.860
 I read it correctly because all the same 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.500
 at university I studied English so 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
 forgive me if this is the first well so 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.340
 prototype stage this sau were built 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
 back in 1960 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.530
 firms and hanomag and handshake for ford 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.190
 also before switzerland and they produced them 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 right before the start of '67 everything was built 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.980
 770 cars attentive person could 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.840
 think somewhere I have already seen these 6 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 correctly made this jagdancer conan on 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 m47 patton base is more correct to say 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 that it was based only on the highway and all 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 the rest is altered 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 but let's move quickly to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.630
 characteristics which i'm sure 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 worries a lot 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.049
 as I said stage it will be 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.720
 be on the ninth level and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.509
 accordingly what we have here 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 firstly there is no armor at all 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.070
 10 to 50 millimeters at the very best 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.670
 places but it is more than compensated 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 two things first. highly 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.009
 compact and fantastic lightweight 27 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 tons of advanced it to the engine 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.390
 capacity of 500 horsepower and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
 accelerates attention to 70 kilometers in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.189
 hour that is, we already understand right now 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 what is actually waiting for us E25 only 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.820
 ninth level 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.439
 and as for the guns rather guns in 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 reality was put here 90 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.250
 millimeter cannon but most likely 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 it will be a drain among the people because well 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.899
 very weak for level nine 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 240 drying oil 212 breakdown and of course 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.770
 should be in that case 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.600
 fantastic dpm but nonetheless in 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.759
 there will be another weapon on top 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 the same strange as regards 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.179
 weak relative to others for something 9 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.480
 of course 390 alpha 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.030
 and 268 penetration that is about the same 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.019
 most like u foch at ninth level well 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.689
 according to German accuracy 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.510
 mixing that is summing up everything 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.920
 the above tth we understand what k on 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.790
 him the puppeteer will be of 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.950
 nothing more than e25 at ninth level 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.590
 very quickly very easy little of 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.980
 dpn im a weapon i hope that so 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.230
 will be 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.680
 and pumped this miracle will of course 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.650
 same panther stand 2 now what awaits us 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.659
 on the tenth level, we already understood that the whole 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.480
 this twig will be including quantifiers 2 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.700
 is a set of quick not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.220
 too powerful them well of course alpha 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.349
 but at the same time very much signed by and 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.049
 quite predictably on the tenth 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.269
 level is waiting for us on the base of the E50 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.519
 in general, of course, quite a long time 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.620
 rumors about this car but it's all the time 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.329
 moved ktts because for nine 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.530
 that is, after Jagdpanther 2 she would be 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.389
 too much for them balata 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.040
 and for the ten, in principle, the rules but 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.319
 still need to put something on 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.480
 level nine to form so 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.340
 say full branch but now when 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.680
 it became known that all the same on the ninth 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.799
 option level was found therefore 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.209
 pt based on e50 can also be entered and what 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.159
 there should be tth 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.129
 this car will be much closer that 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.019
 called spiritually like panther 2 but in 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.090
 Generally, how from the average German 110-ka 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.400
 st8 armor again of course 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.739
 should not expect a fantastic all the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.139
 same as in 50 well and plus cutting somewhere 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.000
 200 millimeters but excellent 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.370
 average speed of the tank and at the same time 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.509
 of course she will not give out 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.489
 750 alpha 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.229
 it would be too likely to be 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.370
 the gun is the same as the yagdtigra on 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:50.970
 ninth level that is 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.650
 560 damage and 207 6 breakdown but only 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.810
 that maybe she will be a little dpm 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.449
 Well, maybe a little more precisely as always, everything 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.879
 these are the most common about and when a weapon with 1 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:02.970
 level moves to a higher level will 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.859
 wait i think yes and i'm finishing with this 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.810
