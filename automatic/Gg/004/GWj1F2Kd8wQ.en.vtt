00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 oh people, all right here in real time 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.890
 It's in control today. I came with a tag. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 Yes, I know it's been a long time since I 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.960
 I will not do tags 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.179
 but I do not think I 'm going to get out of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.490
 videos I can not record videos 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.090
 in a video is good and if I'm feeling 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.109
 the crisis passed today and make a tag 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.630
 And if it's all right, I can finally 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.510
 record video with the shopping month 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.440
 books I've received and everything 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.239
 Come on, good until I pick a tag. 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.399
 say not so recent that the tag 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 literary diseases that I liked 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 quite a lot of fun and found the tag and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.660
 I think some books here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.079
 As the tag asks, let's go. 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.760
 the first to diabetes the very sweet book 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.379
 good politician chosen to represent 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 diabetes disease was the book chills 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.190
 It's been a long time since I read the chill 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 but it's a book I can remember 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 story perfectly because it is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.229
 by the book 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
 he is very cuddly and again I 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 I have not read the continuation yet. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.890
 money to buy further 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 finally he is so he represents 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.799
 diabetes for sure the next book 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.939
 every hour a book you mine and not 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.259
 it was again 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.030
 good the book was chosen for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.960
 to represent each hour was the book 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.479
 miracle 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.020
 The catch was that I managed to finish 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.770
 read this book because people I do not know 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 I like the service so nicolas sparks 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.540
 He's a cool cool author and he's fine. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
 they always have the same thing every 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.680
 books but this is in relevant 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 okay right 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.790
 but a miracle was a book a reading 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.509

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.000
 a goal but that was not a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.739
 miracle I could finish reading 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.890
 this book that I got to the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:18.330

 mainly from the first 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.489
 constantly is not that number 4 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.310
 click a book that has spread as a 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.900
 virus that has spread as a virus and 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.070
 I kept looking for this book during 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.000

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.870
 You're welcome. 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.510
 because it was the only bookstore I 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.870
 I was able to find the limit of attraction 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.019
 I was already on the verge of revolt 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.000
 because all he saw that I entered or 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.100

 finally could not find this book 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.910

 Wonderful story and it is a virus 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.290
 of disease number 5 asthma a book that 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.130
 took out your breath that took my breath away 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.910
 what can be considered asthma is a boy 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.690
 exemplary 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.959
 I received the test for reading the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.390
 Intrinsic publisher and people like this 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.970
 book is book you get the law you 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.669
 so be so scared with the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.400
 story you think so all 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.340
 world chasing you down the street I read that 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.229
 book after I finished I went like this 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.980
 very badly emotionally I do not 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.830
 endured 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 reading a book like that could not 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.270
 suspense and mystery I had to 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.950
 looking for a novel because I needed to 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.830
 a little romance in my life 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.290
 because this book here is very 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.020
 heavy is very complex 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.370
 So he took my breath away. 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.280
 boys in bedroom 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.980
 So this is number 6 in insomnia with 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.530
 Linen took sleep because it takes away my sleep. 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.220
 that I was very anxious to 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.930
 check out the hot blood book 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.660
 I did not like the movie very much 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.160
 unfortunately but I loved the book then 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.520
 so this was the book that took away my 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.890
 I will practically have a very 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.440
 very good 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.390
 Is not that the number 7 amnesia a book 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.610
 You do not remember very well. 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.740
 I do not remember very well, he is the 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.930
 first book in a series that I stopped 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.870
 in half I bought the continuation but 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.040
 Until now I did not feel like it. 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:30.240
 horrible forever this series adoring 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.100
 the series hooked on the series and took 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.560
 to launch the sequel and the series 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.350
 I ended up getting chatinha and I did not stop 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.930
 read the books in the third book to read 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.510
 I'm not reading this very well from 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.760
 Story I confess that if I were this 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.610
 to create the courage to finish reading 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.260
 This knows I would have to review everything 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.870
 again then I do not remember much 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.930
 well of history forever 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.520
 so this is the number 8 malnutrition one 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.950
 boy lacked content 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.450
 reflection a book that lacked content 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.860
 for reflection was the book ties 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.130
 inseparable 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.780
 I thought the story was very good. 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.210
 very much 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.880
 I just read the book and I understood the 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.040
 message that the author wanted to go but 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.930
 in the last pages it does not give much 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.700
 sure I did not feel that emotion that I 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.430
 should have felt 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.860
 according to the author, there was a lack of 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.900
 little content to make me 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.770
 get pretty excited about the story 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.380
 and the last illness is not just travel 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.680
 the book that leads to another time 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.320
 the place is good and if it was one of the books 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.870
 he's in the top ten that 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.480
 the book Juliet 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.040
 I'm free takes the reader to a 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.440
 medieval times 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.900
 so the author was able to write the 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.370
 story in a fantastic way do you feel 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.160
 as if you had in italy 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.500
 wonderful amazing pain and very very 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.380
 good even was one of my first 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.620
 books I example the blog too 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.020
 and it's a lot at the time the father I think 50 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.330
 the book today it is 15 reais in 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.900
 when the submarine makes those 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.000
 promotions and a super recommendation that 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.700
 not yet read this book through 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.760
 it's a historical novel like this 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:24.960
 a page I spend today and 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.330
 another is the past but this does not 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.730
 changes and so it is not equal to 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.640
 these clichés novels that are coming out 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.730
 now it 's very very good so it's worth 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.320
 recommendation of this book and it tags 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.050
 with a golden key 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.630
 this is it people another video with a tag 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.000

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.330
 on this tag literary diseases I will 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.250
 leave here in the description I do not usually 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.170
 talk about the brightness of the information 

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.850
 who created what local I found 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.710

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.200
