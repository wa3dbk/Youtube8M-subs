00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.330
 to the earthworms created by team 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.889
 serpentine are reincarnated now in 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.830
 our mobile devices for 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.020
 go back to bombing worms 2 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.109
 armageddon has not changed much since its 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.460
 appearance for consoles in 2009 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.320
 we have a team consisting of 8 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.360
 worms and we will have to beat ourselves in 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.490
 duel with the opposing team until 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.279
 one of the two be fully animated 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.020
 for this we have a nourished 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.340
 arsenal with some of the more weapons you 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.030
 initials of the history of the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.520
 video game 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.050
 some of them will be blocked from 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.170
 we will access them as we go 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.089
 overcoming campaigns 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.920
 the game is based on combat by 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.199
 shifts where we can move and 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.609
 shoot at a target then we will have 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.600
 to wait for the opponent to fail 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.820
 when it's my turn to shoot him 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.859
 the worms do not die instantly 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.329
 upon receiving an impact they have a 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.070
 life bar that will be reduced 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.899
 depending on the number of attacks 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.899
 that suffer or the strength of these 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.170
 the graphics are enough for this 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.940
 game types are fun and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 colorists according to the style 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.410
 comic that characterizes the whole series and 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.500
 the voices and sound effects accompany 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.450
 perfectly to the rest of the set one 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.520
 thing to thank is that the scenarios 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.410
 the game engine is never repeated 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
 is responsible for generating new maps for 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.010
 each game so we never get 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.190
 we will get bored to get to them 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.190
 levels 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.180
 the campaign mode runs for 30 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.370
 levels set at five 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.409
 different locations like the island of 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.369
 Manhattan the average age or themes 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 related to sports 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.040
 in multiplayer mode we can 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.810
 choose between playing with the same tablet 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.080
 with another partner or by bluetooth 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.130
 with up to 4 simultaneous players 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 The option of 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.670
 online game in which we can define 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.710
 our own parameters for the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.690
 confrontations but we have to say 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.740
 that the shortage of players prevented us 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.740
 be able to try this option 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.370
 worms 2 armageddon will give us hours and 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.650
 hours of entertainment just like he has 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.450
 done the saga for years but not 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.220
 we will complain and its developers will 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.690
 decide to adapt the latest deliveries 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.790
 of the series so that we can finally 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.810
 play with our warrior women in 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.810
 3-d 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.810
 bye 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.960
 in this
