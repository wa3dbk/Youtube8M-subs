00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
and I just homemade did a stop sign

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.060

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
gift for grandparents something with a

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.439 
gift for grandparents something with a

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
little thought into it and it recycles

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.439 
little thought into it and it recycles
egg<00:05:36.900> cartons<00:05:37.320> so<00:05:37.620> that's<00:05:37.830> always<00:05:38.039> good

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
egg cartons so that's always good
