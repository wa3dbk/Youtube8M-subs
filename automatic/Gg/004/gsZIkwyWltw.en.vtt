00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
remember we had it on that we whipped it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.240 
remember we had it on that we whipped it
first<00:04:27.480> for<00:04:27.720> one<00:04:27.870> minute<00:04:28.170> then<00:04:28.740> we<00:04:28.770> put<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.160> on

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
first for one minute then we put it on

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.430 
first for one minute then we put it on
the<00:04:29.340> double<00:04:29.610> boiler<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.840> whipped<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.230> for

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
the double boiler we whipped it for

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.800 
the double boiler we whipped it for
seven<00:04:31.920> minutes<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:33.210> now<00:04:33.420> I'm<00:04:33.480> going<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.690> whip

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
seven minutes and now I'm going to whip

it for another minute and add the
vanilla<00:04:37.110> extract<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.770> guess<00:04:38.040> in<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.340> long

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
vanilla extract so I guess in the long

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.240 
vanilla extract so I guess in the long
run<00:04:38.700> this<00:04:38.850> actually<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> nine<00:04:39.690> minute<00:04:40.530> frosting

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
run this actually a nine minute frosting

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.490 
run this actually a nine minute frosting
rather<00:04:42.060> than<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.390> seven<00:04:42.660> minute<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.320> that's

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
rather than a seven minute but that's

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.160 
rather than a seven minute but that's
cool<00:04:44.180> we<00:04:45.180> try<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.360> get<00:04:45.570> everything<00:04:45.810> out<00:04:46.050> of
