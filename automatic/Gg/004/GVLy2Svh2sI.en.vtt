00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
reason for why it took me so long is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.270 
reason for why it took me so long is
because<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.809> don't<00:00:13.620> know<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:13.980> get<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
because I don't know if I can get in the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.200 
because I don't know if I can get in the
frame<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> broke<00:00:14.880> my<00:00:15.089> toe<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:17.550> I've

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
here if you can see it there was a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.060 
here if you can see it there was a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
version that came out in early 77 when

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
version that came out in early 77 when
the<00:01:08.189> earlybird<00:01:08.430> certificate<00:01:08.760> package<00:01:09.090> came

the earlybird certificate package came

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.160 
the earlybird certificate package came
out<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.720> fold<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
out that would actually when you fold it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
out that would actually when you fold it
in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.830> tip<00:01:14.220> would<00:01:14.430> extend<00:01:14.939> it's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
in the little tip would extend it's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
in the little tip would extend it's
called<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> double<00:01:15.600> table<00:01:16.080> telescope<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
called the double table telescope and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.440 
called the double table telescope and
lightsaber<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:19.650> later<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.189> 77<00:01:21.060> versions

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
lightsaber and the later on 77 versions

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
lightsaber and the later on 77 versions
just<00:01:21.750> came<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> later<00:01:23.280> on

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
just came like that then the later on

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
just came like that then the later on
Empire<00:01:23.850> Strikes<00:01:24.119> Back<00:01:24.299> Return<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> Jedi

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.130 
Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi
versions<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> tip<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
versions and at the tip at all so I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
versions and at the tip at all so I
think<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.009> carry<00:01:29.340> on

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
think it was actually a carry on

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.910 
think it was actually a carry on
lightsaber<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.570> uh<00:01:30.920> yeah<00:01:31.920> his<00:01:32.640> head<00:01:32.939> does<00:01:33.600> go

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
lightsaber but uh yeah his head does go

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
lightsaber but uh yeah his head does go
360<00:01:35.450> degrees<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.640> his<00:01:38.640> arms<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:40.259> are
