00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
little run which it I don't know whether

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.889 
little run which it I don't know whether
it's<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:23.940> not<00:01:24.060> sounds<00:01:24.509> okay<00:01:24.750> though

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
it's right or not sounds okay though

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.880 
it's right or not sounds okay though
which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.289> C<00:01:25.560> bar<00:01:26.399> everything<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> tenth

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
which is a C bar everything on the tenth

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
which is a C bar everything on the tenth
buy<00:01:28.890> everything<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.580> nine<00:01:30.179> and<00:01:30.959> then<00:01:31.170> back

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
buy everything on the nine and then back

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
buy everything on the nine and then back
to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> airline<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.819> your<00:01:32.940> basic

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to the airline so that's your basic

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.669 
to the airline so that's your basic
button<00:01:34.250> at<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.580> student<00:01:36.299> pattern<00:01:36.539> I'm<00:01:36.630> using

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
button at the student pattern I'm using

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.529 
button at the student pattern I'm using
again<00:01:37.679> change<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.429> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:39.270> playing

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
again change it if you like I'm playing

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:48.309 
again change it if you like I'm playing
basically<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:42.319> that's<00:01:43.319> bass<00:01:43.740> top<00:01:44.280> top<00:01:44.580> beers

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.080 

so<00:01:49.319> that's<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:51.050> know<00:01:52.759> which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.940> your

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so that's there I know which is your

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.960 
so that's there I know which is your
step

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.410 

it<00:02:03.970> seems<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.390> work<00:02:04.500> probably<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:07.240> the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
it seems to work probably and that's the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.600 
it seems to work probably and that's the
basic<00:02:07.720> pattern<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.380> goes<00:02:08.560> up<00:02:08.709> three<00:02:08.979> times<00:02:09.280> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
basic pattern it goes up three times and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.880 
basic pattern it goes up three times and
then<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> last<00:02:10.060> time<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.509> see<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.899> might<00:02:11.140> be

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
then the last time it see you might be

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.580 
then the last time it see you might be
minor<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:12.819> AG<00:02:13.209> which<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.990> by<00:02:14.170> everything

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
minor and then AG which is by everything

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.380 
minor and then AG which is by everything
on<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.800> fifth<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.370> then<00:02:15.580> F<00:02:15.730> which<00:02:16.239> you've

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
on the fifth and then F which you've

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.410 
on the fifth and then F which you've
already<00:02:16.540> learned<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.770> sorry<00:02:18.430> go<00:02:18.640> that's<00:02:19.180> a
