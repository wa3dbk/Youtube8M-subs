00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.250

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.210

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.969
 We are that way 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.840
 Tomás Agua asked the others to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:00.900
 They waited for who is going to get ahead 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.930

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.290

 and we saw him guillermo the rose and what 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.980
 called Julio Cesar Uribe and I give him the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.530
 directions to the wilderness 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.350

 first change 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.520

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.240
 and it came in and it was against me in favor of who 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.730
 since 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.160
