principal of this project is that you

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.380 
principal of this project is that you
have<00:00:14.680> to<00:00:14.889> solve<00:00:15.129> questions<00:00:15.699> about<00:00:16.059> things

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
have to solve questions about things

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
to do this project at home you would

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.830 
to do this project at home you would
need<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.960> board<00:00:26.290> color<00:00:27.190> pencils<00:00:27.790> a<00:00:28.000> sharpie<00:00:28.600> a

need a board color pencils a sharpie a

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.880 
need a board color pencils a sharpie a
ruler<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.680> select<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.570> would<00:00:31.689> need<00:00:31.890> figures

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
ruler and select you would need figures

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.080 
ruler and select you would need figures
to<00:00:33.430> know<00:00:33.610> which<00:00:33.880> player<00:00:34.239> is<00:00:34.570> which<00:00:37.949> and<00:00:39.090> the

thigh and some color paper to put your
algebra<00:00:44.770> questions

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.820 

play<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.150> algebra<00:00:54.540> game<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.290> roll<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.650> die

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
play the algebra game you roll the die

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.380 
play the algebra game you roll the die
since<00:00:56.490> I<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> three<00:00:57.240> I<00:00:57.450> move<00:00:57.840> three<00:00:58.140> squares

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
since I got a three I move three squares

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.430 
since I got a three I move three squares
then<00:01:00.990> I<00:01:01.170> grab<00:01:01.380> a<00:01:01.410> card<00:01:01.890> these<00:01:02.460> cards<00:01:02.790> have

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
then I grab a card these cards have

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.580 
then I grab a card these cards have
inner<00:01:04.440> qualities<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> linear<00:01:06.300> functions<00:01:06.810> for

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
inner qualities and linear functions for

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
inner qualities and linear functions for
example<00:01:07.620> this<00:01:08.310> card<00:01:08.580> says<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.170> minus<00:01:10.170> five

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
example this card says a minus five

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.210 
example this card says a minus five
minus<00:01:10.830> B<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.540> equals<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.690> 10<00:01:12.870> V<00:01:13.320> equals<00:01:13.860> support

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
minus B a equals to 10 V equals support

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.200 
minus B a equals to 10 V equals support
10<00:01:14.790> minus<00:01:15.300> 5<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> 5<00:01:17.210> minus<00:01:18.210> 4<00:01:18.510> is<00:01:18.810> 1<00:01:19.850> then<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
10 minus 5 is 5 minus 4 is 1 then I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.250 
10 minus 5 is 5 minus 4 is 1 then I
check<00:01:21.690> my<00:01:21.870> answer<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.650> answer<00:01:22.979> sheet

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
check my answer on the answer sheet

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.050 
check my answer on the answer sheet
since<00:01:25.260> I<00:01:25.410> got<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.190> moved<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.820> more

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
since I got it right I moved one more

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
since I got it right I moved one more
square<00:01:28.400> then<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.670> passed<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.090> diet<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.450> explain

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
square then I passed the diet to explain

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
square then I passed the diet to explain
then<00:01:31.890> he<00:01:32.250> rose<00:01:33.290> since<00:01:34.290> he<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> four<00:01:35.700> he

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
then he rose since he got a four he

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
then he rose since he got a four he
moves<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:40.100> then<00:01:41.100> he<00:01:41.759> grabs<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.270> card<00:01:43.700> this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
moves for it then he grabs a card this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
moves for it then he grabs a card this
card<00:01:44.940> says<00:01:45.210> Y<00:01:45.840> divided<00:01:46.530> by<00:01:46.560> 2<00:01:46.700> plus<00:01:47.700> X<00:01:48.119> y<00:01:49.050> equals

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
card says Y divided by 2 plus X y equals

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.170 
card says Y divided by 2 plus X y equals
2<00:01:49.830> 2<00:01:50.009> x<00:01:50.580> equals<00:01:51.210> 2<00:01:51.330> 1<00:01:51.509> 2<00:01:52.470> divided<00:01:53.009> by<00:01:53.040> 2<00:01:53.160> is<00:01:53.610> 1

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
2 2 x equals 2 1 2 divided by 2 is 1

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
2 2 x equals 2 1 2 divided by 2 is 1
plus<00:01:55.110> 1<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:56.190> be<00:01:56.250> 2<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
plus 1 would be 2 that would be the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.520 
plus 1 would be 2 that would be the
right<00:01:58.890> answer<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.330> would<00:02:00.660> have<00:02:00.720> said<00:02:00.930> 2<00:02:01.290> for

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
right answer if I would have said 2 for

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.969 
right answer if I would have said 2 for
example<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:03.000> gotten<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.050> wrong<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.620> would<00:02:04.950> have

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
example and gotten it wrong I would have

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.370 
example and gotten it wrong I would have
just<00:02:05.310> stayed<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.970> same<00:02:06.150> place<00:02:07.910> then<00:02:09.380> if

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
just stayed in the same place then if

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.970 
just stayed in the same place then if
for<00:02:10.679> example<00:02:10.739> if<00:02:11.340> he<00:02:11.370> rolls<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.940> 2<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.650> next

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
for example if he rolls a 2 the next

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.190 
for example if he rolls a 2 the next
time<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.670> goes<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.989> next

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
time he goes to go to the next

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.699 
time he goes to go to the next
checkpoint<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:17.370> he<00:02:17.670> lands<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.269> he<00:02:19.080> goes<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
checkpoint if he lands there he goes to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.560 
checkpoint if he lands there he goes to
the<00:02:19.799> next<00:02:20.160> checkpoint<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.970> grabs<00:02:21.330> another

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the next checkpoint and grabs another

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.400 
the next checkpoint and grabs another
card<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:23.310> he<00:02:23.640> gets<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.090> card<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:24.660> he<00:02:25.170> just

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
card if he gets that card right he just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.180 
card if he gets that card right he just
stays<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:26.750> then

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
stays it then

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.810 
stays it then
if<00:02:29.190> he<00:02:29.549> rolled<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.620> go<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.459> start

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
if he rolled to the go back to start

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.440 
if he rolled to the go back to start
then<00:02:33.600> he<00:02:34.470> has<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.920> go<00:02:35.670> back<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> start

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
then he has to go back to the start

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:46.990 
then he has to go back to the start
start<00:02:36.959> all<00:02:37.110> over<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.799> not<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> card
