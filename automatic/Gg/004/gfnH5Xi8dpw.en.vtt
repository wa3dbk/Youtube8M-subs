math<00:02:05.390> that's<00:02:05.750> was<00:02:05.930> actually<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.260> think<00:02:06.290> one<00:02:06.560> of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
math that's was actually I think one of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.830 
math that's was actually I think one of
the<00:02:06.800> one<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.640> really<00:02:07.850> neat<00:02:08.210> new<00:02:08.420> features

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
the one of the really neat new features

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.890 
the one of the really neat new features
on<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.979> device<00:02:10.310> he's<00:02:11.090> running<00:02:11.390> laps<00:02:11.570> five

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
on this device he's running laps five

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.130 
on this device he's running laps five
point<00:02:12.200> oh<00:02:12.820> my<00:02:13.820> point<00:02:14.030> 0<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.240> using<00:02:14.540> vector<00:02:14.900> math

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
point oh my point 0 is using vector math

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.950 
point oh my point 0 is using vector math
so<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.740> actually<00:02:15.920> have<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.160> much<00:02:16.340> more<00:02:16.550> fluid

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
so you actually have a much more fluid

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
demonstration of the touchscreen

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.800 
demonstration of the touchscreen
very<00:03:59.530> responsive<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.430> do<00:04:01.090> multi-point

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
very responsive and do multi-point

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.199 
very responsive and do multi-point
gestures<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.500> course<00:04:03.459> at<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.760> base<00:04:03.939> of<00:04:03.969> this

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
gestures of course at the base of this

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.220 
gestures of course at the base of this
is<00:04:04.420> silly<00:04:04.659> Windows<00:04:05.079> 7<00:04:05.409> PC<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:07.030> what<00:04:07.540> motion

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
is silly Windows 7 PC and so what motion

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.479 
is silly Windows 7 PC and so what motion
us<00:04:08.349> they<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.620> lot<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.829> industrial

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
us they do a lot of industrial

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.330 
us they do a lot of industrial
enterprise<00:04:10.000> had<00:04:10.359> demonstrations<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.799> the

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
enterprise had demonstrations and so the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.679 
enterprise had demonstrations and so the
stylists<00:04:12.819> are<00:04:12.849> going<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.090> take<00:04:13.180> notes<00:04:13.480> or

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
stylists are going to take notes or

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.319 
stylists are going to take notes or
whatnot<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.709> ideas<00:04:14.980> here<00:04:15.189> for<00:04:15.909> work<00:04:16.090> you

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329
