00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 My name is same and I am a flavor that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 devotes to the communication of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.320
 ie capitalists had live entertainment 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.560
 in an agency 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.279
 my favorite cartoons the first one is 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.279
 super gay 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:38.220
 a little wild and bloody a juice 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.220
 colors and also 2006 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 obviously because there are words and all the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 virtual chat and cybernetics 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.860
 my most favorite movies of life 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.690
 it's the stoner movies that do not 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.580
 they make think those that let you form 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.190
 a joint and make fun of all the time 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.050
 all the bullshit that comes out if they would be 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.879
 those 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.730
 there is a bato right now that just 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.500
 discover that it's German I think it's more 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 status you are state 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.650
 and I think it would be annoyance 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.650
 favorite in production 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.350
 same listen your favorite band is a 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.240
 group that is called hip hop and pop is a 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.750
 mix as electronic sounds 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.799
 aliens promotion we have 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.390
 like tennis and everything mixed like 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.560
 very electronic compositions 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.020
 quiet 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.030
 suddenly they carry as they are created as 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.250
 environment then I live that I like how 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.390
 we will generate environments and situations 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.460
 where the music that comes more and right now 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.319
 I like it a lot too, all 90 are 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.310
 musicians nailed to the ninth techno 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.770
 to dance and here 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.770

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.670
 and we do it from vuskovic but in my 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.100
 free Times 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.920
 Well I come to my house if they are my cats 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.080
 I am 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.910
 I am unfortunately a robot 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.410
 capitalism then in my spare time 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.410
 I try to break loose 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.300
 all my childhood I was in love with 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.100
 julian casablancas obviously all the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.830
 foreign girls because I think that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.320
 we're just not there why not 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.500
 there is nothing simply is how we are 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.350
 here we are all and the only thing 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.230
 we need is to know who we are 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.790
 and I think all the answers we 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.370
 we have them and that is why we are 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.770
 here and it does not matter where you come from 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 where are you I have alien thrips 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.150
 side works trips but at the end 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.940
 I'm a human so I think every 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.640
 who we have to make our own 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.540
 reality be it virtual physics 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.080

 with my boyfriend we've been around a lot 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.430
 time and it's a little more relationship 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.829
 cosmic and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.360
 maybe even during the show it would be 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:46.660
 digital 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:50.190
 interactive and live that leave the 13th 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.190
