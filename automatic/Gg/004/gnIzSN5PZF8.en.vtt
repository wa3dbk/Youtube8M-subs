00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
amazing it's very pigmented and I almost

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I noticed that it almost has like a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.070 
I noticed that it almost has like a
creamy<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> powder<00:01:23.939> shadow<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
creamy it's a powder shadow but it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.190 
creamy it's a powder shadow but it
almost<00:01:25.200> has<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.830> creamy<00:01:26.840> texture<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
almost has like a creamy texture to it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.510 
almost has like a creamy texture to it
and<00:01:29.420> when<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.570> apply<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:32.250> very

and when you apply it it's very very
pigmented<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.079> palette<00:01:37.470> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
be a great palette for summer now my

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.499 
be a great palette for summer now my
opinion<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.250> don't<00:02:05.610> wear<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.240> color

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
opinion if you don't wear a lot of color

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.050 
opinion if you don't wear a lot of color
a<00:02:06.659> lot<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.079> colors<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.799> shadows<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.550> don't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
a lot of colors and your shadows I don't

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.900 
a lot of colors and your shadows I don't
think<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.360> would<00:02:09.569> be<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> great<00:02:10.140> palette<00:02:10.619> for

one thing that I didn't love was that it

I feel like I needed a matte Brown
shadow<00:03:25.160> as<00:03:25.760> well<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.420> makes<00:03:26.600> a

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
shadow as well because it makes a

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.480 
shadow as well because it makes a
difference<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.350> you're<00:03:27.470> elaborating<00:03:28.220> an
