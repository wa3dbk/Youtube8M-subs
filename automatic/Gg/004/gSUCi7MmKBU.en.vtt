00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Catterfeld we want what you did not learn or the entrance with the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.610
 silent majority 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.509
 the goal 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.419
 always ask me the questions you better if he had himself 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.689
 current Gandara I think I believe that the attempt is made of course 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.160
 to approach a certain resentment there is a discomfort in 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.159
 the population towards people 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.989
 get the hartz4 and do not make the impression as if they were special 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.019
 willing to work because they may be with the beer bottle on 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.749
 the street corner or, alternatively, do not care about their children properly 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.079
 take care and the like 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.649
 and you think that can not be that the cost of one 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.579
 Tax money life is a very common thought in the population 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.350
 and it will be taken up and there will be in this way 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.829
 fertilized 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.570
 I think that's what he thinks with the silent majority 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.400
 Great discomfort that we face in the face of social abuse without a doubt 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.140
 also gives 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100
 Of course, not every Hartz 4 recipient regards social abuse though 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.840
 Of course, there is a clientele that does that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.230
 and there is the discomfort that picks me up and that with the for the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 Making FDP productive that seems to me to be the purpose of the exercise 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.500
 the exciting thing about the whole story is we have six and a half million 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.610
 People who get Hartz four 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.070
 and we have 800,000 vacancies in Germany 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 that means even if they all wanted to be motivated and wanted to work 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.620
 We would not have anybody working here in the club and can put that to work 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.650
 is always the first 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.670
 so if you do not want to work so you can say good for 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.900
 in the end, these are no places anyway 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.060
 we have a lot of Hartz 4 receivers 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.710
 even lost in the long term for this society 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.640
 because they come from a social background where they have a work ethic 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 as we do not even own them in the office of a good bourgeois board 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 We can not get it that we now somehow money 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.570
 but we can not get away with it in the one who takes them away 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.870
 Call for snow shoveling 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.220
 that means we have an animal thiel we have in this country 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.890
 have to pay without being able to reveal anything about her 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.160
 that's easy 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.060
 the fact they criticized that it does not happen that way but it is the fact 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.830
 the balance sheet is sobering 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.050
 embossed 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.350
 I would use Vivien for a completely different reason and that maybe does 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 also the difference in the discussion 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.060
 each of the public funds is paid 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.450
 regardless of the old the sick against women with young children like that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.940
 continue 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.610
 must for what he gets from the community of taxpayers 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.450
 To provide a return we wanted some with this principle 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.790
 with the Westerwelle have no reason to complain and we all have to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.760
 Agree about it and that is not prohibited in Germany is not 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.110
 difficult in a television studio on the principle is not his thing 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.579
 that this should be so 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.569
 However, there is nothing to do with reality 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.400
 The Barriers we have reached from the Factors an actual each 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.649
 Performance not but for the communities the Solinger strike reason 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.779
 if you look at our company or just by the 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.159
 late Roman decadence to and indeed across all population Cech 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.859
 of billionaires who bring their money to Switzerland 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.360
 about people preparing their tax returns 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.360
 He follows everyone who tries to rip off his thriller on the road with his car 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.309
 wants to make his neighbor jealous 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.690
 the whole and situation of our capitalist economic system 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.509
 if they look at it exactly 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.879
 then they have him every one of the composite view 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.000
 and then they have the same thinking that prestige thinking status thinking 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.609
 the stick me something auspicious off I'm not stupid I do not do it 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.439
 do not do this work again either 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.059
 in all shifts also with the Hartz 4 receivers 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 with what right if the 1 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.079
 if we demand that hartz iv receivers the better 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.120
 People should be 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 and a greater willingness to show new ways performance than the rest of the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.940
 Social games SMS learn that we have our work approx
