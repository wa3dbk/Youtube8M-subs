doing<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.259> decarbonization<00:00:13.259> using<00:00:14.099> water<00:00:14.700> well

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
doing a decarbonization using water well

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.300 
doing a decarbonization using water well
I'm<00:00:15.150> actually<00:00:15.269> using<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.870> clean<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.010> fluid

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310

this<00:00:17.460> time<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:19.080> subscriber<00:00:19.949> asked<00:00:20.279> me

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
this time but a subscriber asked me

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.410 
this time but a subscriber asked me
because<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:20.939> bit<00:00:21.060> different<00:00:21.359> on

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
because it's a little bit different on

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
because it's a little bit different on
these<00:00:21.510> cards<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.529> lift<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
these cards so just lift it up as you

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.900 
these cards so just lift it up as you
can<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:25.039> remove<00:00:26.039> some<00:00:26.279> pipes<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.730> just

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
can see and remove some pipes that just

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.519 
can see and remove some pipes that just
go<00:00:27.060> under<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> underneath<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> actual

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
go under the underneath of the actual

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.939 
go under the underneath of the actual
filter<00:00:28.800> itself<00:00:29.810> now<00:00:30.810> when<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.679> these

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
filter itself now when you do in these

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.920 
filter itself now when you do in these

really<00:01:56.189> won't<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> problem<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> idea

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
really won't have a problem now the idea

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.940 
really won't have a problem now the idea
behind<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.670> water<00:02:00.590> goes<00:02:01.590> into

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
behind this is that the water goes into

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
behind this is that the water goes into
the<00:02:02.159> actual<00:02:02.369> combustion<00:02:02.939> chamber<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> stings

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the actual combustion chamber and stings

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.499 
the actual combustion chamber and stings
the<00:02:04.350> piston<00:02:04.890> head<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.280> everything<00:02:06.060> around<00:02:06.180> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the piston head and everything around it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.520 
the piston head and everything around it
really

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
really

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.170 
really
but<00:02:09.530> yeah<00:02:10.129> this<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.849> theory<00:02:11.150> behind

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
but yeah this this is the theory behind

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.270 
but yeah this this is the theory behind
it<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.810> every<00:02:12.230> time<00:02:12.260> I've<00:02:12.590> used<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.950> I've<00:02:13.069> also

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
it and every time I've used it I've also

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.539 
it and every time I've used it I've also
always<00:02:13.910> noticed<00:02:14.480> an<00:02:14.690> increase<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.799> power<00:02:16.010> more

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
always noticed an increase in power more

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.789 
always noticed an increase in power more
responsive<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.780> generally<00:02:18.049> Idols<00:02:18.590> more

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
responsive and it's generally Idols more

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.680 
responsive and it's generally Idols more
bail<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.690> was<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.129> actually<00:02:22.690> does

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
bail if you was if you actually does

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.970 
bail if you was if you actually does
camera<00:02:23.959> doesn't<00:02:24.200> really<00:02:24.319> pick<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.739> very

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
camera doesn't really pick it up very

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.970 
camera doesn't really pick it up very
well<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.790> towards<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.299> end<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:27.319> car<00:02:27.620> is<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
well but towards the end the car is a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.280 
well but towards the end the car is a
lot<00:02:28.310> more<00:02:28.489> raspy<00:02:29.060> earnest<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:30.230> know

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
lot more raspy earnest and it's you know

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.809 
lot more raspy earnest and it's you know
it<00:02:30.440> responds<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.950> lot<00:02:31.250> quicker<00:02:31.459> than<00:02:31.670> they<00:02:31.760> did

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
it responds a lot quicker than they did

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.740 
it responds a lot quicker than they did
before<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:33.769> like<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.700> say<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.120> take<00:02:35.299> your<00:02:35.510> time

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
before so like I say just take your time

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.750 
before so like I say just take your time
and<00:02:37.599> squirt<00:02:38.599> your<00:02:38.870> clean<00:02:39.290> up<00:02:39.470> into<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.069> or

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
and squirt your clean up into it or

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.539 
and squirt your clean up into it or
water<00:02:41.030> distilled<00:02:41.660> water<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:43.099> can<00:02:43.310> use<00:02:43.340> tap

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
water distilled water you can use tap

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.490 
water distilled water you can use tap
water<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.540> know<00:02:44.660> distilled<00:02:45.110> water<00:02:45.230> is

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
water but you know distilled water is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.420 
water but you know distilled water is
probably<00:02:45.860> about<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.739> yeah<00:02:48.739> that's<00:02:49.069> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
probably about so yeah that's it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.009 
probably about so yeah that's it
every<00:02:50.030> time<00:02:50.239> I've<00:02:50.390> used<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.629> like<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.870> said

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
every time I've used it like I said

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.900 
every time I've used it like I said
before<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.470> always<00:02:51.680> get<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> much<00:02:52.700> more

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
before I always get a much more

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.430 
before I always get a much more
responsive<00:02:53.450> vehicle<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:55.959> yeah<00:02:56.959> always<00:02:57.170> work

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
responsive vehicle and yeah always work

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
the throttle body around the edges where

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.720 
the throttle body around the edges where
the<00:03:08.420> dirt<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.870> grime<00:03:08.900> built<00:03:09.410> up<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:10.550> is

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
the dirt and the grime built up this is

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.240 
the dirt and the grime built up this is
all<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:11.270> stuff<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.630> escape<00:03:12.050> from<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:13.070> know

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.530 
all just stuff this escape from you know
the<00:03:13.670> filler<00:03:14.300> itself<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.050> in<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.560> around<00:03:15.590> it

you<00:04:13.840> could<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.140> hear<00:04:14.349> how<00:04:14.709> much<00:04:14.980> raspier<00:04:15.730> and

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
you could just hear how much raspier and

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.420 
you could just hear how much raspier and
thicker<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.040> how<00:04:18.489> much<00:04:18.910> better<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.299> sound<00:04:19.570> so

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
thicker and how much better it sound so

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.689 
thicker and how much better it sound so

I<00:04:21.729> always<00:04:22.330> say

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.460 

so<00:04:27.200> we've<00:04:27.470> got<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> new<00:04:29.470> decarbonized

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
so we've got a new decarbonized

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.250 
so we've got a new decarbonized
opportunity<00:04:31.010> we<00:04:31.100> use<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.370> at<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.520> moment

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
opportunity we use it at the moment

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.760 
opportunity we use it at the moment

works on the card you see the image can
you<00:04:44.090> see<00:04:44.240> how<00:04:44.330> clean<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.810> is

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
you see how clean it is

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.420 
you see how clean it is
well<00:04:47.360> I've<00:04:47.450> been<00:04:47.600> spraying<00:04:47.960> older

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
well I've been spraying older

decarbonisation it's a wall based
decarbonize<00:05:05.600> er<00:05:05.630> so<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.230> not<00:05:06.440> got<00:05:06.740> no

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
decarbonize er so it's not got no

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.420 
decarbonize er so it's not got no
hydrocarbons<00:05:08.630> in<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.810> because<00:05:09.080> fundamentally

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
hydrocarbons in it because fundamentally

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.970 
hydrocarbons in it because fundamentally
hydrocarbons<00:05:10.430> is<00:05:10.580> what<00:05:10.790> creates<00:05:11.650> carbon<00:05:12.650> you

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
hydrocarbons is what creates carbon you

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.100 
hydrocarbons is what creates carbon you
know<00:05:13.100> you<00:05:13.430> won't<00:05:13.580> get<00:05:13.760> no<00:05:13.910> carbon<00:05:14.330> if<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.050> you

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
know you won't get no carbon if so you

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.180 
know you won't get no carbon if so you
won't<00:05:15.290> get<00:05:15.380> no<00:05:15.470> carbon<00:05:15.800> buildup<00:05:15.980> if<00:05:16.130> you

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
won't get no carbon buildup if you

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.340 
won't get no carbon buildup if you
didn't<00:05:16.430> use<00:05:16.520> hydrocarbons<00:05:17.240> that's<00:05:18.050> why<00:05:18.170> when

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
didn't use hydrocarbons that's why when

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.820 
didn't use hydrocarbons that's why when
people<00:05:18.650> use<00:05:19.690> water-methanol<00:05:20.690> injection<00:05:20.830> they

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
people use water-methanol injection they

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.370 
people use water-methanol injection they
don't<00:05:22.040> get<00:05:22.220> no<00:05:22.600> carbon<00:05:23.600> build<00:05:23.810> up<00:05:23.900> there<00:05:24.110> that

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
don't get no carbon build up there that

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.090 
don't get no carbon build up there that
everything<00:05:24.770> inside<00:05:25.010> is<00:05:25.280> pretty<00:05:25.520> clean<00:05:25.730> so<00:05:27.100> one

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
everything inside is pretty clean so one
