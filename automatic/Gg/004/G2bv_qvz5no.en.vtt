especially<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:29.550> they're<00:00:29.670> well<00:00:29.849> done

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.010 
obviously I don't like them so much what
they're<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:32.910> done<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.570> guys<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.989> that

I hate insta-love

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.240 
I hate insta-love
but<00:00:35.910> when<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.360> romantic<00:00:37.200> plot<00:00:37.530> line<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.980> very

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
but when a romantic plot line is very

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
but when a romantic plot line is very
well<00:00:38.460> done<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:39.329> enjoy<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
well done and when I really enjoy a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
well done and when I really enjoy a
couple<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.440> bump<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> book<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.100> an<00:00:41.219> entire

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
couple that can bump a book up an entire

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
couple that can bump a book up an entire
star<00:00:41.850> rating<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.660> been

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
star rating from what it would have been

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
star rating from what it would have been
if<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> wouldn't<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> had<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.010> good<00:00:44.430> romance

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
if it wouldn't have had a good romance

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
if it wouldn't have had a good romance
in<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.270> think<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.840> make<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> characters

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
in it I think it can make the characters

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
in it I think it can make the characters
a<00:00:46.620> ton<00:00:46.829> more<00:00:47.010> sympathetic<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.730> lot<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a ton more sympathetic a lot of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
a ton more sympathetic a lot of
character<00:00:48.629> development<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.559> happens<00:00:49.980> within

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
character development it happens within

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
character development it happens within
romance<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.809> necessarily<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
romance and that's not necessarily a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
romance and that's not necessarily a
necessary<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:53.969> think

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
necessary thing to have I don't think

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.330 
necessary thing to have I don't think
that<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.510> books<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> romance<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that all books have to have a romance in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
that all books have to have a romance in
them<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> makes<00:00:57.180> sense<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
them but when it makes sense and when it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.630 
them but when it makes sense and when it
provides<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.680> character<00:00:59.010> development<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
provides some character development I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
provides some character development I
think<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.359> great<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> lot<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> times<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
think it's really great a lot of times a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.049 
think it's really great a lot of times a
lot<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> female<00:01:02.280> characters<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> books

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
lot of female characters and books

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.189 
lot of female characters and books
because<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.539> tend<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> read<00:01:03.960> female

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
because I tend to read female

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
because I tend to read female
protagonists<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> lot<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> their

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
protagonists get a lot of their

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.679 
protagonists get a lot of their
character<00:01:06.030> development<00:01:06.450> through<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
character development through the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.359 
character development through the
relationship<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> female<00:01:08.220> protagonist

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
relationship with the female protagonist

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
relationship with the female protagonist
so<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> didn't<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.840> relationship

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so if you didn't have a relationship

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.160 
so if you didn't have a relationship
there<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.369> any<00:01:11.580> kind<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
there of any kind it would just kind of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
there of any kind it would just kind of
you<00:01:13.619> wouldn't<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.430> ain't

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you wouldn't get to see that you ain't

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.800 
you wouldn't get to see that you ain't
get<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> character<00:01:15.210> development<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
get to see the character development a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.210 
get to see the character development a
good<00:01:16.229> example<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.189> always

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
good example of this because I always

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
good example of this because I always
talk<00:01:17.610> about<00:01:17.640> him<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.119> Warner<00:01:18.450> from<00:01:18.570> shatter<00:01:18.869> me

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
interest in shatter me you would have

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
interest in shatter me you would have
really<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.470> anything<00:01:25.830> about<00:01:26.220> him<00:01:26.549> and

so<00:04:43.520> typically<00:04:43.910> speaking<00:04:44.270> I'm<00:04:44.390> not<00:04:44.570> going<00:04:44.780> to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
so typically speaking I'm not going to

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.420 
so typically speaking I'm not going to
enjoy<00:04:45.050> them<00:04:45.350> it's<00:04:45.680> going<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.890> make<00:04:45.980> me<00:04:46.100> kind<00:04:46.250> of

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
enjoy them it's going to make me kind of

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.650 
enjoy them it's going to make me kind of
dislike<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.820> characters<00:04:47.210> because<00:04:47.510> there's

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
dislike the characters because there's

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.700 
dislike the characters because there's
all<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:47.810> back<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.170> forth<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.440> they're<00:04:48.590> just

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
all this back and forth and they're just

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.460 
all this back and forth and they're just
drama<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.430> don't<00:04:49.700> like<00:04:50.420> that<00:04:50.690> kind<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.170> drama

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
drama I don't like that kind of drama

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.920 
drama I don't like that kind of drama
but<00:04:52.310> if<00:04:52.940> it's<00:04:53.090> well<00:04:53.270> done

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
but if it's well done

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.320 
but if it's well done
it<00:04:54.140> is<00:04:54.260> beautifully<00:04:55.070> beautifully<00:04:56.030> executed

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330
