00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.600
 well let's see how it is made 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.540
 a strap with filling here we can 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.639
 see in this portfolio is attached to it 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.639
 with a sconce and rivets 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:22.160
 of this we mean the filling 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.160
 a spaghetti now I'm going to show you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.780
 this is the spaghetti that fills the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.790
 belt 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.090
 it's a plastic spaghetti you can 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.420
 get in any house selling the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420
 bouquet 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.520
 it's quite malleable and that's what it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 Use to fill the belts of the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.470
 wallets 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.180
 on the other hand we take 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.380
 a hill 5 centimeters wide on 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.620
 long they put it according to their taste 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.740
 we do as always a fold 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.740
 let's go over 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.910
 we draw a seam 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.370
 on the edge we are taken by the press 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 fabrics 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.170
 internal 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.100
 what do I know that will take us 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.100
 sewing 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.190
 well here you can see this similar to what 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.920
 we did 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.320
 the previous time with the strap 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.710
 the backpack strap is the same 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.310
 just that we'll be doing a single stitching 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.310
 or sewing 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.679
 and the masters region 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 well those are three steps to fold over 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 and sew 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 we come to the end 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.049
 and now what we have to do is 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.049
 to size 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.479
 the spaghetti always leave a space 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.490
 free either to bend and adhere to the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.420
 wallet with the rivet as we saw in the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.500
 shows or sew directly between the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.070
 bellows and body 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.070
 we cut 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.470
 we introduce it into the hole that we 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.750
 stay 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 this is quite simple we help each other 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.610
 with a ballpoint pen to center it and ready 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.500
 we finished the belt 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.100
 Here you can see about the model as they 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.070
 He said 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.870
 you can join it with aplica and tachas or 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.870
 directly to the body 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.460
 Well I hope you find it useful that 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.930
 put into practice 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.930
 and see you next
