00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
folded them fold it and fold like that

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.229

you haven't at the other end is a nice
clean<00:00:48.309> fold<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:49.870> just<00:00:50.140> overlapped<00:00:50.770> them

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
clean fold so I just overlapped them

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.619 
clean fold so I just overlapped them
like<00:00:51.580> this<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.210> hot<00:00:53.199> glue<00:00:53.530> like<00:00:54.460> that<00:00:54.699> and<00:00:55.390> I

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
like this and hot glue like that and I

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:06.930 
like this and hot glue like that and I
needed<00:00:55.960> mine<00:00:56.350> for<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:56.980> base<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.550> my<00:00:57.820> tree

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.890 

and<00:01:07.030> then<00:01:07.840> Ichiro<00:01:08.410> after<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.250> when<00:01:09.490> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and then Ichiro after that when I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
and then Ichiro after that when I
started<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:11.030> started<00:01:12.320> halfway<00:01:13.320> between<00:01:13.640> but<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
started I started halfway between but it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
started I started halfway between but it
didn't<00:01:15.150> necessarily<00:01:15.300> stay<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.440> but<00:01:16.620> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
didn't necessarily stay that way but I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
didn't necessarily stay that way but I
just<00:01:17.010> fit<00:01:17.190> as<00:01:17.340> many<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:17.880> could<00:01:18.090> across<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
just fit as many as I could across and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
just fit as many as I could across and
the<00:01:19.710> second<00:01:20.100> row<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.400> eight<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the second row was eight and then I just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
the second row was eight and then I just
continued<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.290> fill<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.800> until<00:01:22.980> I<00:01:23.160> had<00:01:23.370> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
continued to fill in until I had the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.110 
continued to fill in until I had the
entire<00:01:23.790> cone<00:01:24.330> finished<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.550> top<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
entire cone finished and on the top I

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.650 
entire cone finished and on the top I
glued<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.470> Christmas<00:01:29.160> stuff<00:01:29.660> puncture

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
a little hole underneath and I stuck a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.460 
a little hole underneath and I stuck a
toothpick<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> punctured<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.140> hole<00:01:34.170> in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
toothpick in and I punctured a hole in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.650 
toothpick in and I punctured a hole in
the<00:01:34.590> top<00:01:34.800> of<00:01:34.950> my<00:01:35.160> tree<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.730> I<00:01:36.090> placed<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
the top of my tree and I placed the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.170 
the top of my tree and I placed the
toothpick<00:01:37.080> down<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> hole<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.580> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
toothpick down into the hole and I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.580 
toothpick down into the hole and I
haven't<00:01:39.480> glued<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.080> yet

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
haven't glued it in yet

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.730 
haven't glued it in yet
but<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.170> did

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
but you can see that that's what I did

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.550 
but you can see that that's what I did
so<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.210> sit<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so now that will sit right in there and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.950 
so now that will sit right in there and
then<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.280> hot<00:01:47.610> glue<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.119> place<00:01:48.150> or<00:01:48.600> not

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.750 

now<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> made<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.040> did<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.520> my

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
now when I made this one I did use my

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.719 
now when I made this one I did use my
telephone<00:01:54.720> pole<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.710> cut<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> pages<00:01:56.280> down

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
telephone pole and I cut the pages down

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
telephone pole and I cut the pages down
to<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.150> same<00:01:57.450> size<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.500> seemed<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to this same size because this seemed to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.250 
to this same size because this seemed to
work<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.220> as<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> great<00:01:59.700> size<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.030> making<00:02:00.900> the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
work out as a great size for making the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.710 
work out as a great size for making the
tree<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.450> really

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
tree and there you go that's a really

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.740 
tree and there you go that's a really
cute<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.170> tree<00:02:04.470> oh<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:06.150> then<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.540> set

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
cute little tree oh and then I just set

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.580 
cute little tree oh and then I just set
it<00:02:06.869> into<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.260> glass<00:02:07.650> from<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.070> kitchen
