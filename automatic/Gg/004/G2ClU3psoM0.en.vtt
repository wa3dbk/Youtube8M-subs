before<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> take<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.710> your<00:01:52.979> first<00:01:53.130> batch<00:01:53.659> now

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
before you take out your first batch now

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.300 
before you take out your first batch now
when<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.049> working<00:01:55.409> with<00:01:55.439> body<00:01:55.770> filler<00:01:56.009> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
when you're working with body filler you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
when you're working with body filler you
use<00:01:56.490> manageable<00:01:57.390> amounts<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.110> why<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> like

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
use manageable amounts that's why I like

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
use manageable amounts that's why I like
using<00:01:58.799> these<00:01:59.070> credit<00:01:59.399> card<00:01:59.610> style<00:01:59.850> cards

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
using these credit card style cards

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
using these credit card style cards
because<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.020> throw<00:02:01.320> them<00:02:01.500> away<00:02:01.530> once

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because I can just throw them away once

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.480 
because I can just throw them away once
I'm<00:02:02.250> done<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.460> them

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
I'm done with them

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
I'm done with them
here<00:02:05.490> I've<00:02:05.670> add<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.149> cream<00:02:06.479> hardener<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
here I've add in my cream hardener and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
here I've add in my cream hardener and
I'm<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> start<00:02:07.619> mixing<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.789> body

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I'm going to start mixing the body

filler now you can see my technique here
is<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.270> I'll<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.870> forth<00:02:13.260> and

to be using during last at first year on
this<00:02:30.330> panel<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.380> some<00:02:31.620> spots<00:02:31.950> where

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
this panel is I have some spots where

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.180 
this panel is I have some spots where
the<00:02:32.720> fabric<00:02:33.720> wasn't<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.230> tight<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.860> wish<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the fabric wasn't as tight as I wish it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.950 
the fabric wasn't as tight as I wish it
would<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.430> been<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.300> kind<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.630> sagged

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
would have been so it kind of sagged

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.230 
would have been so it kind of sagged
down<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.260> little<00:02:37.530> bit<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.550> don't<00:02:38.880> want<00:02:39.120> my

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
down a little bit so I don't want my

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.870 
down a little bit so I don't want my
shape<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.380> look<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> volcano<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:41.790> I'm

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
shape to look like a volcano so what I'm

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.370 
shape to look like a volcano so what I'm
kind<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.150> doing<00:02:42.330> here<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> I'm<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> be

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
kind of doing here is I'm going to be

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.560 
kind of doing here is I'm going to be
building<00:02:43.710> up<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.370> small<00:02:44.790> amount<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
building up that small amount of the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.990 
building up that small amount of the
shape<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.830> nice<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.130> smooth<00:02:47.610> nice

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
shape so that it's nice and smooth nice

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.070 
shape so that it's nice and smooth nice
and<00:02:48.300> round<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.060> see<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> technique

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and round you can see that the technique

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.110 
and round you can see that the technique
here<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.830> remove<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.340> small<00:02:53.490> amount<00:02:53.940> and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
here is to remove a small amount and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.390 
here is to remove a small amount and
apply<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> small<00:02:54.990> amount<00:02:55.170> at<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.650> time<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.160> don't

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
apply a small amount at a time I don't

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.460 
apply a small amount at a time I don't
like<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.910> nuts<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.900> working<00:02:58.320> with

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
like going nuts I like just working with

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.590 
like going nuts I like just working with
a<00:02:58.500> small<00:02:59.070> little<00:02:59.610> manageable<00:03:00.210> area<00:03:00.570> at<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.990> time

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
a small little manageable area at a time

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.020 
a small little manageable area at a time
now<00:03:03.600> here's<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.200> most<00:03:04.350> valuable<00:03:05.160> tip<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.820> could

point<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> video<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.810> what<00:03:15.960> I've<00:03:16.050> done<00:03:16.260> is

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
point in the video and what I've done is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.470 
point in the video and what I've done is
I<00:03:16.680> started<00:03:17.220> by<00:03:17.400> testing<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:18.300> my

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
I started by testing it with my

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.270 
I started by testing it with my
sandpaper<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.440> make<00:03:19.590> sure<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.160> was

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
sandpaper to make sure that it was

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.700 
sandpaper to make sure that it was
sanding<00:03:20.700> away<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> styrofoam<00:03:22.320> type

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
sanding away like a styrofoam type

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.030 
sanding away like a styrofoam type
consistency<00:03:23.990> since<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.140> was<00:03:25.380> sanding<00:03:25.890> with

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
consistency since it was sanding with

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.190 
consistency since it was sanding with
that<00:03:26.160> consistency<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.030> start<00:03:27.510> sanding<00:03:27.810> right

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
that consistency I start sanding right

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040 
that consistency I start sanding right
away<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.890> whole<00:03:29.070> piece<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:30.360> no<00:03:30.750> time

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
away on the whole piece and in no time

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.260 
away on the whole piece and in no time
flat<00:03:31.080> I'll<00:03:31.770> have<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.490> thing<00:03:32.720> smooth<00:03:34.070> don't

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
flat I'll have this thing smooth don't

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
do this in a manageable section so I

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.860 
do this in a manageable section so I
started<00:04:42.010> with<00:04:42.160> just<00:04:42.400> doing<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:43.150> bottom<00:04:43.630> half

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
started with just doing the bottom half

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.710 
started with just doing the bottom half
of<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.530> panel<00:04:44.740> as<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:45.850> see<00:04:46.150> in<00:04:46.360> this

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.770 

once<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.160> rage<00:04:56.370> gold<00:04:56.730> has<00:04:56.940> entered<00:04:57.330> its<00:04:57.480> green

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
once the rage gold has entered its green

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.320 
once the rage gold has entered its green
stage<00:04:58.140> you<00:04:58.650> want<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.980> sand<00:04:59.280> all<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.760> highest

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
stage you want to sand all the highest

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.810 
stage you want to sand all the highest
most<00:05:00.570> aggressive<00:05:01.260> spots<00:05:01.590> first<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:02.670> don't

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
most aggressive spots first so don't

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.670 
most aggressive spots first so don't
concentrate<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:03.630> one<00:05:03.660> area<00:05:04.200> until<00:05:04.530> you've

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
concentrate in one area until you've

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.350 
concentrate in one area until you've
knocked<00:05:04.920> down<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> tough<00:05:06.060> difficult

knocked down all the tough difficult

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.720 
knocked down all the tough difficult
spots<00:05:06.960> then<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.950> can<00:05:08.100> concentrate<00:05:08.460> in<00:05:08.640> one

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730

to start to come across small pits that

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.960 
to start to come across small pits that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
sure that you don't over sand these

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
sure that you don't over sand these
locations<00:05:26.310> as<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.820> will<00:05:26.940> lead<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.420> low<00:05:27.780> spots

instead<00:05:29.640> we<00:05:29.910> will<00:05:30.060> continue<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.690> sand<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:31.290> a

instead we will continue to sand in a
smooth<00:05:31.800> even<00:05:32.250> pattern<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.090> then<00:05:33.480> we<00:05:33.660> will

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
smooth even pattern and then we will

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.540 
smooth even pattern and then we will
come<00:05:34.020> back<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.560> cover<00:05:34.920> those<00:05:35.100> up<00:05:35.160> with

come back and cover those up with
another<00:05:35.970> coat<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:37.200> rage<00:05:37.380> goal<00:05:39.620> we<00:05:40.620> will
