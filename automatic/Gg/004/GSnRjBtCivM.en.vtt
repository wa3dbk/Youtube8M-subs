00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.670
 this is mine revealed the pilot of boquim 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.349
 good 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.150
 It's that game that goes away and you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.350
 starts on the street and a lot of zombie 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.789
 wanting to kill you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.980
 ops wrong civil aaa game 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.740
 I'm talking about walking dead that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.769
 started in 2013 with the hq kicking 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.530
 rear that in 2010 seriously kicking 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.649
 with the shine passing the hand in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.649
 head 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 with the success of here and the series rolling 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.660
 that the first game of al that owes that is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.789
 based on hq it is necessary to speak when 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.550
 this game is fucking thanks with unique style 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:57.960
 with the story the unpublished characters and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.579
 rock scenes take this is you but it is not 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.059
 this ranking since we are going to speak 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.010
 sim which should lead instinct is is 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.840
 What the fuck is it that this game is so 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.840
 Bad as I say let's find out 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.770
 the game starts with a hunt 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 impressive and that caused the terror 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.530
 because the character deserves more because 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.460
 he is on the cover of the game 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.679
 no i'm the father of dr bits know that 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.140
 character that neither face has so let's 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:50.240
 to hunt down slowly 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:57.200
 Yes, I did and I'll finally go. 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.569
 play with the modern and no crosby bull 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.479
 but I wanted a crust the club of 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:09.410
 world has a chono hylda exam 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:20.450
 our first mission of 21 years 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:23.030
 survivor what batteries 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.220
 He's a cop and he calls a guy. 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.910
 to search for the battery is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.910
 right 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.600
 on a mission it's simple you 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.120
 You need to get the key generator and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.420
 deliver to a man who is this guy 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.910
 there 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 or you can just pick up the key 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.070
 and turn on the player and make him 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.900
 die but I'm a good guy and 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.350
 I'll get the geben gas key to do with 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.390
 that you die but if you do this mission 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.410
 if I give battery to the police officer 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.300
 it will not help you 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.460
 if you deliver battery it will give you 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.320
 cover the purpose is useless if it 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.730
 You understand me, because you always wash 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.550
 giving because it does not help you right 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.930
 bank or the first 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.640
 mission you can choose between 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.410
 asked 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 now you can choose between vehicles 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.020
 which are rendered foreign 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.980
 Earth 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.790
 fritz street and highway which are roads 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.560
 main 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.890
 but it's much easier to choose 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.600
 between background street because you take 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.190
 more simply are less likely to 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.450
 break and finally we got in by 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.170
 button coiling blah blah blah blah 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.090
 blah wheels are arriving at the place where 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.260
 Is the love that I do not know the name of? 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.360
 city neighborhood in 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:50.660
 we find that there are 12 at the time pulling 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:54.140
 survivors eb key - hoper t 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.420
 I 'm from the comtel but with that. 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.360
 we discover that evil is the sniper 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.940
 it was obvious we see my firing 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:11.260
 in the hotel and sometimes we see a performance 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:11.260
 nor of the largest English language school 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.579
 and the best acting Oscar goes to 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.340
 those unb dead on the ground because that 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.780
 it was the young man's best performance to have a 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.699
 of the things that I find most boring in this 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.250
 game winning the entire game because the 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.870
 game is really bad are about time 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.600
 you save during the game 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.490
 still wall bilbao log within a 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.260
 Interesting concept because you save 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.760
 he said that his team and this is 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.490
 cool because it makes you feel like a 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.160
 leader can send for more supplies 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.260
 No actually they are useless 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.180
 it always finds the interim or 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.370
 two and banal that you can 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.900
 find more than 30 in the worst scenario 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.520
 of all is that they are back RenÃª 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.710
 spending supplies they brought 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.050
 Everyone, if they're going to let them die. 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.669
 but now that we're just going mood you're 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.860
 thinking will he kick the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.950
 back together with miguel and the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.800
 for this is how you can see just me 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.940
 helps keep an eye on an encore is eoa 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.860
 that's right 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.449
 well this game has an interesting mission 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.250
 how to save the cat that old is 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.200
 exactly the kind of thing I would do 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.169
 in the zombie apocalypse where this person 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.010
 where she does not know where and she has a 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.539
 zombie friend what friendship minc ongs 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.180
 we finally got to where the cat is and 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.550
 I can not see he was ready after 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.870
 three hours playing I finally got the 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:40.580
 klose modern serious three o'clock botafogo 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.620
 here is where the biggest rome to put away 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.360
 the source was not paying attention to the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.949
 even next story 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.620
 in the end, people come to 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:51.680
 evacuation and without a doubt the worst ending that 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.620
 I have seen then threw it that must take the 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.789
 incentive is really a bad game 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.789
 but he has his good times 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.379
 sure that the strongest point of the 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:10.240
 game without doubt is the del moral because the 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.240
 side of them are perfect 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.330
 river the beef goulart 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.880
 but this does not save the game the story 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.430
 mediocre gameplay is a safe 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.170
 shock the songs and 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.240
 alternative paths are interesting 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.430
 makes you want to see the parts and 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.260
 the game routines despite the bills 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:44.720
 right now 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:47.310
 It's awesome jean and it will change our 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.350
 good so if you want a kill game 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.390
 zombies with the old and the bigger 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.370
 I recommend you download free distinction 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:07:08.070

00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:10.260
