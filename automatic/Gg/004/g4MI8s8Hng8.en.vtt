in<00:00:21.660> our<00:00:21.840> last<00:00:22.020> lesson<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.980> took<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> look<00:00:23.609> at

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
in our last lesson we took a look at

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.089 
in our last lesson we took a look at
this<00:00:23.849> fruit<00:00:24.090> tree<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> realized<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.919> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
this fruit tree and realized that to the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.060 
this fruit tree and realized that to the
branches<00:00:27.079> needed<00:00:28.079> to<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.470> when<00:00:28.770> is<00:00:28.919> to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
branches needed to come out when is to

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.839 
branches needed to come out when is to

when is to vertical they didn't meet our

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.720 
when is to vertical they didn't meet our
criteria<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.690> 10<00:00:34.470> o'clock<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.280> 2<00:00:35.550> o'clock<00:00:37.730> so

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
criteria of 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock so

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.780 
criteria of 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock so
we'll<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.089> cut<00:00:39.269> those<00:00:39.449> out<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:41.519> tree

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
we'll just cut those out and the tree

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.700 
we'll just cut those out and the tree
will<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.030> much<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.140> light<00:00:45.140> much<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.409> air

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
will have much more light much more air

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.390 
will have much more light much more air
and<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.820> existing<00:00:48.300> branches<00:00:49.040> will<00:00:50.040> be<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.220> lot

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
and the existing branches will be a lot

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.649 
and the existing branches will be a lot
healthier<00:00:51.619> and<00:00:52.619> we<00:00:52.830> have<00:00:53.010> our<00:00:53.220> angles<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.239> 10

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
healthier and we have our angles of 10

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.429 
healthier and we have our angles of 10

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:58.439 
o'clock and 2 o'clock there's one minor

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
out at the right angle but then goes

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.660 

it's<00:01:28.909> extremely<00:01:29.539> important<00:01:30.070> when<00:01:31.070> making<00:01:31.130> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
each branch as it meets the trunk

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.550 
each branch as it meets the trunk
creates<00:01:41.450> an<00:01:42.259> area<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.549> swollen<00:01:44.030> area<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.810> collar

the SAP in the tree comes up through the

the SAP in the tree comes up through the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
that's extremely important if it's

that's extremely important if it's
further<00:02:07.130> out<00:02:07.539> it'll<00:02:08.539> leave<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> stub<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.610> that

further out it'll leave a stub and that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.370 
further out it'll leave a stub and that

some orchardists now are modifying the

some orchardists now are modifying the
central<00:02:25.130> leader<00:02:25.280> system<00:02:25.760> slightly<00:02:26.440> they'll

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
central leader system slightly they'll

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.760 
central leader system slightly they'll
cut<00:02:27.740> out<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.070> center<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.390> tree<00:02:29.720> when<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
cut out the center of the tree when it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.740 
cut out the center of the tree when it
gets<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.160> eight<00:02:31.670> or<00:02:31.820> ten<00:02:32.030> feet<00:02:32.060> tall<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
gets to be eight or ten feet tall and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.690 
gets to be eight or ten feet tall and
then<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.430> tree<00:02:37.430> will<00:02:37.790> develop<00:02:38.480> two<00:02:38.810> or<00:02:38.990> three

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
then this tree will develop two or three

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480 
then this tree will develop two or three
leaders<00:02:40.700> at<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.330> very<00:02:41.540> top<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.490> increase
