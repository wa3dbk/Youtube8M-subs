00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.720
 riscle 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.480
 concept is unique 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.669
 more often born in mass of 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.140
 of Centraide 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.050
 when we know his offensive weight 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.320
 and then that can lead to his tour starts 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.810
 the trans-Saharan hordes of the United Way 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.510
 however pointed out a year loot in tackling new york 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.410
 she get away with it as soon as we have the opportunity to put the ball in front 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.550
 the goal 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.380
 for it's really a goal opportunity 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.250
 you have to put it in front of you, you must not procrastinate 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.590
 of this trade like that 10 to his family 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 a scorer opportunity 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240
 bull 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.680
 the veteran hal and center at the first pole and perols and center back 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.370
 percent and center at the far post a center stretched in front of the goal and all 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.860
 fish that can no longer be forged 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 to aim for someone, there are several kinds of ashes 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.160
 I think that 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.380
 get around it when you're in action 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.229
 you have to quickly get it into their heads for 100% too much for 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 make the best choice 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.019
 bull i worked a lot for young people 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.999
 I think that in the training it is important to work especially the 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.409
 new lane player 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.849
 I worked a lot with the fefa patrick battiston we 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.969
 a lot 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.399
 learned a lot 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.559
 but we did a lot of session we surf on the touch of the finger especially 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.949
 the centers and cross 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.429
 and then there I will regularly go to year enter because 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:33.719
 I have enough 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.719
 concentrated by training for a bodice 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.370
 I think it's the regularity 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.940
 and to climb 2 of the danger locker especially its centers I think it's 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.199
 play right now for me 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.039
 for a corridor player 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 cc you have to work you have to continue working 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.049
 we do not care you have to feel the ball at the bottom 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.579
 amine different points of the bee-eater this joint kick jumped 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.069
 top of the foot 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.789
 I think it's really surprising 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.649
 take it by doing rehearsals on his side 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.229
 we started then a being a little bit his foot or what to know more 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.149
 touched balloons I think it's really like that how 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.149
 thank you 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.319
 but a perfect center 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.189
 maybe a center 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.730
 in you want with an attacker who arrives at full speed by scoring 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.419
 the head 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.329
 in full race I think that it can be a perfect center 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.129
 already launched 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.639
 school wear 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.979
 those followed by 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.979
 two camps control for yoyo yoan gouffran 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.199
 on a free kick at the base 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.529
 on his side his left side 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.429
 and so the name that crisscross gourcuff who was responsible for from thierry to 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.429
 the back a little bit a small wall of players at about 8 meters 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.419
 and I snuck quietly on the left side 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.639
 nobody sees 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.109
 the Lyon gourcuff pretends to shoot in the package but the slip 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.529
 bolton city side which is all the time there i really have all the time to 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.220
 but just center and happy but admit they have France notch 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.779
 at the first post 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.259
 here I am trying to center fit 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.259
 so he can mark 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.289
 on a failed center it can be 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.569
 a center that knows 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.900
 so you want to put it perfectly 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.539
 the balloon and it's been five years that we are hearing 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.419
 before reaching the attacker goes into the pit center a rotten center 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.659
 trial 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.659
 it 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.589
 no 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.520
 20 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 20 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.859
 difficult
