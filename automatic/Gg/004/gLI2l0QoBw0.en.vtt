the brake is actually one of the most

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
the brake is actually one of the most
important<00:01:49.770> well<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> most

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
important well I think is the most

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.420 
important well I think is the most
important<00:01:51.450> pedal<00:01:51.719> of<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:53.009> three

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
important pedal of your of all three

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.459 
important pedal of your of all three
pedals<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.049> pedal<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
pedals because that's the pedal that

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.319 
pedals because that's the pedal that
makes<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.799> stop<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> press<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
makes you stop you want to press in the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
makes you stop you want to press in the
brake<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.049> far<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.829> and
