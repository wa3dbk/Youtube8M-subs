00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.910
 good we are with javier castro that we 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.230
 will teach the last terminals of 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.910
 micros or the luminous 640 and 640 xl that 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.830
 they are mid-range terminals but with 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.080
 almost high-end specifications and with 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.910
 everything you can tell us about these 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.620
 terminals good as well you say 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.730
 we announced today the two terminals 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.170
 from 640 to 640 xl two different versions 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.640
 and what we are doing is carrying 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.680
 characteristics and experiences of 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.210
 high-end terminals to terminals 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 mid- range range at super prices 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.730
 Competitive expert in 3g versions or 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.170
 in 4g lte versions in both cases 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.059
 when starting with the for the little one 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.920
 by 640 what we have a screen 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.660
 5-inch one ips panel with 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.949
 resolution hd mounted on a 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.749
 quad-core qualcomm processor 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.579
 second with 2 gigahertz of frequency 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:52.190
 clock a gig of ram memory with what 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.480
 which to go super fluid to run 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.969
 any type of application in the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.129
 ecosystem windows a main camera 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.400
 8 megapixels with autofocus with flash 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.640
 of a mega pixel front camera 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.690
 for everyone self and calls 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.090
 battery two thousand five hundred thousand amperes 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.930
 and of course with housing and battery 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.420
 Removable colored casings 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.700
 interchangeable and classic colors 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.430
 traditional microsoft in this case 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.760
 white blue and orange with finish 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.530
 gloss and black with matte finish 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.230
 we will have three versions a 3g version 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.450
 dual without a lt single version without 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.890
 fun dual lte unequaled to be the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.840
 first time we will have terminals with 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.910
 windows with 8.1 in this case with the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.500
 unit update in and when to 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.930
 cinema on the market in version 4 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.420
 great in price and availability that 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.619
 we are talking about the 3g version 139 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.560
 euros before taxes and subsidies 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.840
 and that of the versions 4g 159 euros 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.250
 will be available globally to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.080
 from the month of April and well we are 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.420
 already working with operators and others 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.770
 clients to attract them to Spain and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.500
 we will confirm the dates more 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.700
 go ahead and what good your case has is the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.470
 older brother who would be the lumia 640 xl 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.300
 what we have is a screen still 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 larger 5.7 inches 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.940
 allowed screens and in this case 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.380
 also as with the 640 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.580
 optimized for any intensity 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.460
 light both indoors and outdoors 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 in full sunlight and also in this 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.180
 case also good of course 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.590
 hd resolution regarding the processor in 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.670
 this case we have the same processor 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.100
 from four cores to one with 2 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 gigahertz clock frequency 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.720
 Qualcomm and the camera is also 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.460
 different in the case of 640 x the is the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.240
 main camera we are talking about that 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.130
 we went to 13 megapixels autofocus and with 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.960
 optical to 6 in which we incorporate in 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.610
 all high- end terminals to a 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.230
 much more competitive price going down 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.270
 ranges but without giving up 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.460
 LED flash specifications of course 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.120
 and the front camera in this case 55 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.849
 megapixels 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.220
 3000 amp battery so 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.019
 we grow from expandable memory card 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.870
 in both cases up to 128 gigabytes of 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.420
 reliable memory and 30 gigs 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.670
 that we have available when the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.250
 it says in the cloud a giga of ram also 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.129
 in this case available in four 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.500
 colors also a white to start 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.239
 better black blue and orange in version 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.940
 mate and the white investment both mathematician 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.620
 as in price brightness in this case 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.780
 we have four versions two times three 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.769
 in as much without the sim as dual sim and two 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.099
 lte versions 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.440
 in 3g versions from 189 euros 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.750
 before taxes and subsidies and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.790
 versions 4g 219 euros also before 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.950
 taxes and subsidies availability 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.780
 from this same month already from frame to 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.950
 global level so with we are 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.240
 working with recuperators for 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.560
 to work 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.480
 what is another of the points that 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280
 these two terminals characterize 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.410
 which are mid-range terminals but 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.770
 with high-end features of what 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.180
 kind then our screen clans on the 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.380
 wait as you are seeing here then the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.510
 we have also incorporated in both 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.400
 terminals and of course also everything 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.750
 the world of the sensors that we have 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.280
 incorporated throughout the range as you can 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.350
 be sensor sensor because also 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.330
 we incorporate between the devices and 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.770
 with the novel functionalities of the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.880
 update of the umÃ­a dening from the 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.330
 point of view the application of a 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.010
 camera with a camera version 50 what 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.660
 that we have is all the capture mode 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.090
 enriched that as you know we have 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.070
 the possibility of capturing photographs with 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.050
 all hdr filters without the need of 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.340
 activate it previously and also the flash 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.870
 dynamic in order to obtain a 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.610
 photography in low conditions 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.049
 luminosity with the best light always 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.980
 both the foreground when we do the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.260
 photo with flash 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.450
 as the part of the back of the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.010
 back of the photograph with a bar 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.650
 just to be able to slide and 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.880
 works the photographs which is another of 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.320
 the news that we have announced and it is 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.980
 that with these other devices with the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.570
 purchase of each of them 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.720
 what we are going to have is a license of 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.240
 my 365 people for free 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.310
 for a year that includes this license 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.630
 of office 365 of course the last 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.430
 version of office applications 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.170
 but also the possibility of using the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.030
 license not only for our 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.820
 terminal lumia but also for a pc 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.270
 be it a pc or a mac and a tablet not 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.420
 be a tablet with windows version 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.820
 at 16 5 it also includes one terabytes of 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.280
 Cloud storage in Malaga 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.500
 free way to block and 60 minutes 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.270
 monthly calls by Skype then in 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.660
 countries where it is available 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.460
 which is why we are saying that it is a 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.500
 license that is estimated at a value 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.450
 of 70 dollars to the lazio with which 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.530
 We are providing the best options and 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.270
 the best services to all 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.670
 users in different price ranges 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.040
 has of course both terminals in 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.570
 updables to next window in the 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.700
 version that will arrive during this year 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.420
 2015 and our mission is that the rest of 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.850
 terminals that we have a portfolio 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.380
 a 28.1 today is also 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.400
 update to windows with some 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.850
 characteristics may vary 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.410
 depending on the device but as 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.540
 you see the commitment is still providing 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.220
 something to have the latest functionalities 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.660
 in the latest experiences in the 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.940
 best microsoft services in all 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.350
 the price ranges 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.080
 without renouncing specifications by 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.700
 have a more competitive price a doubt 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.620
 that we can not be answered for 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.260
 when a high range for when a range 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.570
 high good well if we can respond to 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.700
 that question our intention is to take 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.430
 our next high-end terminals 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.810
 with the biggest innovations in the part 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.710
 of hardware but also with the part 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.710
 of the software and for that 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.730
 good many thanks to you and 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.770
 nothing then we will see in the next 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.700
 event watching windows 10 and the last 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.700
 terminals thanks
