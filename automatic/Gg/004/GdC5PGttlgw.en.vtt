 or less a month away 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.899
 the ps3 version arrived in the week 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 if I'm not mistaken when they do 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.710
 one week arrived and today on the 21st of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.540
 together with the launch of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.030
 collection 2 should be concerned and 13 to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.300
 the pc on facebook finally arrived on pc 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.829
 It's for those who do not know it was software and it's a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 new game mode that is actually a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.940
 way in itself it is really only one 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.770
 internet variation that as 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 this way is made off is divided into 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.100
 one-on-one matches and two against 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.359
 two and three against three 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.890
 in this war that you are seeing 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.159
 I'm putting it for you. I'm playing. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.260
 three against three on the map and ground guess 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.689
 that this is the same name is the two maps 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.400
 free distributed by made by only 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 infinity ward are the ground and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.030
 ronan that what if I'm not mistaken and ground 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.049
 I'm not sure but I think it 's the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 ground is 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 and has two other maps teachers 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
 are the look out your way 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.439
 these two are acquired through lcs 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.970
 you buy collection 2 should be like 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.290
 I said I left today also on the 21st to 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.000
 the ps3 and pc 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.360
 you get these two maps to zero did 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.159
 software and dude, I played a little bit 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 already this match was also the first 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.520
 on this map and if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.750
 how was it for you I think the ideal 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.700
 I'm not sure 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 and was the first match on this map 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.829
 before that I played two matches in the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.439
 roger and I really liked the game mode 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.770
 Summer is fun, but it's normal. 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.210
 huh 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.009
 so it's cool because they are new maps 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 so I really like to map new power 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.380
 play but the new one knows and how is it 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.969
 thing 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.680
 the business includes for free all 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.509
 world has access so many young people 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.180
 I can not play good and I like it 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.670
 pretty is bacaninha is fun is more 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.710
 fesp se than the sindsef max that 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.140
 as normal it is because you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.030
 It's very busy, it's very fast. 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 I liked it and you'll see that one. 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.819
 game play car what will happen 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 I did not watch the videos at the end. 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.760
 will see what will happen at the end of 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.130
 game play 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.840
 I was very good, I 'll say that I 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.520
 I stayed and it's not to start distrusting 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.250
 only if you will see what happened 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.760
 at the end of this crime play is like me 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.680
 said 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.480
 besides this of this made suffer their goal and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.160
 also collectors should be this 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.840
 collection two of them she brings maps of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.590
 advanced on xbox live which is the map 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.569
 Oasis is shrine if I'm not mistaken. 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.489
 also arrives and there is one more dog remembering 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.890
 Anyway, I also think a couple of 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.840
 missions of the spec ops and such beyond the 246 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.360
 off is how you know I bought it 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.790
 collection must be given in module s3 in 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.280
 pc when she left is there a month and a half 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.299
 two months do not know and little by little 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.950
 Brazilian bought a game of 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.810
 few matches in those but I think 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.670
 that I only brought 12 game place 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 of those collection maps should be 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.480
 you on the channel and even when you left 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.940
 updating the collection should always 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.380
 I thought google everything the pc version and not 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.870
 Can you find the right room and look for it? 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.180
 a nation cnet room to appear there 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 up that was only available is okay so 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.290
 rooms of six or seven hours very 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.000
 little and finally the infinity ward 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.160
 Fixed this bug by updating 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.780
 which comes along with made off the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.730
 finally did arrange it so 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.519
 now you're looking for the nation fundefnet 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.010
 is the fire engine on pc now finds 0 of 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.780
 50 rooms on the same consoles 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 at least these tidies took 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.109
 They took time to pack but at least 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.819
 they then fixed the pc version 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.130
 back to the way it was before 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.109
 So I think now maybe it will increase 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.640
 little more the number of players who play 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.620
 on the pc and then had this update 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.600
 collection should be a lot of people 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.069
 stopped playing I was even me 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.959
 I started to play a lot less is so much that 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.030
 I had that time, I started the most 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.220
 orbital complex now maybe that did it 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.709
 only return to play a little more the way 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.049
 refers to three, not even from what I have seen 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.680
 enough playing did it off of pc eu 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.359
 I tried starting arrives quickly I 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.069
 I looked for the upgrade then 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.480
 many people were also aware that 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.190
 this update and I think after the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.900
 staff begins to become more aware of 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.880
 update has exited and the mode is 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.569
 made available and will now begin but 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.739
 to buy not to play and I do not know 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.780
 I'm still going to buy two collection 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.880
 and I really enjoy having the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.320
 new maps and such but I like to play 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.270
 they also did not want to play 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.280
 two new maps dodo did off but I did not 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.910
 I know if a lot of people are going to buy then it's 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.380
 complicated 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.850
 let's not see what I'm going to do I do not 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.800
 I know if I'm going to buy or I'm not thinking. 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.980
 still on possibility is at 15 dollars 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.470
 as is already customary and perhaps 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.690
 policy they already bought on psn also 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.250
 the next door already has a while ago with 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.780
 Do you know the microsoft partnership? 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.030
 with the objective of launching the first ten 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.240
 days of code in xbox live 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.740
 You see, there I was playing in this 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.960
 Next game play more defensively 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.670
 I not moved forward as much as it should have 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.290
 perceived I 'm in search of an airplane 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.850
 Big question is I'll get way to 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.050
 Who knew I could do it? 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.430
 who follows me on twitter probably 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.400
 You already know the answer because I was 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.050
 very brave happened and they will have 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.730
 nice just to tell you that I was angry 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.380
 You already know it will not roll move. 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.450
 this game but it 's not that it will not 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.150
 roll over some bench in the game for some 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.670
 Appeal something like this was not for pure 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.370
 azar same guy is using is also a 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.590

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.840
 I was once again very 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.580
 back area of the map 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.620

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.740
