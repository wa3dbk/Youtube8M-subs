00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.520 
are very hard gum paste and they are dry
so<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:10.970> doubt<00:02:11.300> anybody<00:02:11.780> would<00:02:11.959> be<00:02:12.080> eating<00:02:12.410> these

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
so I doubt anybody would be eating these

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.500 
so I doubt anybody would be eating these
anyway<00:02:12.950> but<00:02:13.430> if<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.640> do<00:02:13.820> use<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.239> powder

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
anyway but if you do use this powder

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
anyway but if you do use this powder
make<00:02:14.840> sure<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.350> your<00:02:15.530> clients<00:02:15.950> know<00:02:16.100> that

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
make sure that your clients know that

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.120 
make sure that your clients know that
it's<00:02:16.880> not<00:02:17.060> edible<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.780> whatever<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:18.950> on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
it's not edible and whatever this is on

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.370 
it's not edible and whatever this is on
should<00:02:19.760> be<00:02:19.910> removed<00:02:20.269> from<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.570> cake<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:21.290> it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
should be removed from the cake but it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.560 
should be removed from the cake but it
does<00:02:21.560> give<00:02:21.739> you<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> nice<00:02:22.220> high<00:02:22.670> metallic<00:02:23.090> sheen

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
does give you a nice high metallic sheen

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.820 
does give you a nice high metallic sheen
to<00:02:23.900> whatever<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.350> paint<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.590> have
