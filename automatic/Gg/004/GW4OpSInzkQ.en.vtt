00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello everyone, the next report is small 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.960
 the buildings 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:15.049
 arrived late today 12 Saturday 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 today but the breeze was a rain sutra 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 did such here props yourself and how 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.019
 it turned out a neighbor came here said that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 it's called or bags 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.769
 Well, I'm still doing these things here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.270
 I myself rested then the design a little 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.899
 harder and in theory the stakes top edge 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 it is necessary here I will do it well 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.570
 although I drove pretty deep 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.340
 the ground is soft for now 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:56.809
 backed glasses I did this to myself 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 just from here these are cut off like 1 meter 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 cut and here they stayed and now 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.510
 they are all here for me 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 the knot is twisted somewhere on 5 screws and grater 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:22.470
 in the ride and no and the tip is inserted into the hole 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 from how do I go there beams length 7 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.689
 centimeters I go beams sharply 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 shroud 5 + board with 2 and a half than 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.170
 get 7 and a half well there isn't exactly 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 Exactly 7 Sibits 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.210
 I did not clearly go there with 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.610
 roof frames are included 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.649
 that is, as if that part which stands in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 shit here this twenty she is not easy 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.009
 on the screws it is still there 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.610
 such lighting well, and I need it for 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.909
 order to finish here the filly with 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 that side, we almost cover the roof 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.390
 I'll go around this way 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 But in this state I have now 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.709
 the roof is laid three lanes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.400
 vapor barrier cantor sheathing and 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.590
 crates 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.950
 I put another lane today 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.480
 put himself pulled orgies nafig I 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 started doing at all but he winds like that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.080
 silische fought with this sail but 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.640
 pulled like a drum well so today 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.190
 the viewer did not come brigade this thread 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.790
 This he finishes previous kalym 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.220
 four doors are inserted and I decided here 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.980
 I will close the roof I will not do these 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 side this year just me already 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.300
 I've got a little construction site already 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:53.510
 began to strain this year inside 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.980
 I mean these windows for this year 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.690
 such a grand building I 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.840
 finish I do n't want to take a rest winter 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.320
 so in April no longer continue 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.930
 tired with the new forces of the prostrate 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.959
 by hands 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.030
 continue in the top three I decided still two 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.260
 of the day 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.530
 combine in one video since the last 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.260
 nothing much visually here 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.010
 changed today finished crate 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.560
 on this side of the roof away from the garage 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.430
 thread all brought out and planted literally 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.489
 Well, stuff five 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.590
 under a chic so-called somewhere 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.109
 sagging sheathing is exclusive 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.640
 where was a mote and had to have one 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.430
 there was a bitch change there were three 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.880
 she sagged straight 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:55.880
 and that is all is well with the crate 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.880
 and here is the tile cascade 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:06.359
 like that sorry here the sharpness is apparently not 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:09.120
 It was here and so if you become and therefore 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.040
 one sheet was screwed and daughter went daughter 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.760
 go-go-go and still goes already 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.380
 all probably 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.849
 two or three working on the roof is impossible 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:24.479
 the rest of the time we aligned with that 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:27.150
 the sides of the rafter there I am one extremely 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.139
 rafters from which everything seemed to go on 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.780
 which lay no how 1 she was belly 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.699
 and accordingly the following belly I do not 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.699
 could understand in growth where what and when already 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.860
 then they started to unscrew and 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.630
 find out found the stage launched and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.669
 accordingly all subsequent rafters 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.960
 lowered but this is the middle which I 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.930
 leveled here I somehow in the video 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.930
 showed well, and on this I finish today 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 until
