No Car, No House (by All "Left-over" Boys)

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.308
Lovely sunshine falls upon my face.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:26.574
Looking at the girls around, everyone is pretty.

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:30.911
Their fashion and style make our life full of sunshine.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:35.092
They have infinite desires for the life.

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:39.409
Do you have a car? Do you own a house?

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:44.148
How much money do you have in banks?

00:00:44.632 --> 00:00:48.327
If you have no car, if you own no house...

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:52.445
Then forget about the sadness and sing a song with me.

00:00:53.237 --> 00:00:56.964
I have no car. I own no house.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.361
I can only sing for you.

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:05.606
Please don't break my heart,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.122
Because you are my dreaming girl. 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.417
I have no car. I own no house.

00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:18.886
I just have a good heart.

00:01:19.432 --> 00:01:22.831
Please don't ask too much from me.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.511
Because you are the nicest girl. 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.362
Lovely sunshine falls upon my face.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:45.241
Looking at the girls around, everyone is pretty.

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:49.624
Their fashion and style make our life full of sunshine.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.681
They have infinite desires for the life.

00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:58.186
Do you have a car? Do you own a house?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.598
How much money do you have in banks?

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:06.785
If you have no car, if you own no house...

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:11.155
Then forget about the sadness and sing a song with me.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:15.450
I have no car. I own no house.

00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:19.712

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:23.921
Please don't break my heart,

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:28.455
Because you are my dreaming girl. 

00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:33.115
I have no car. I own no house.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.545
I just have a good heart.

00:02:38.037 --> 00:02:41.229
Please don't ask too much from me.

00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:46.044
Because you are the nicest girl. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.513
I will buy a car. I will buy a house.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.844
I will sing a song for you as well.

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.762

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:07.563
I will buy a car. I will buy a house.

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.850
I want you to be my bride.

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:16.209
Please don't ask too much from me.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.261
Because you are the nicest girl.

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:25.255
La, la, la...

00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:29.854
