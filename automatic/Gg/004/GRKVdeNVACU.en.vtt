00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.200
 here we made him love the car on 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.300
 can lift a little ferrari no 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.980
 laugh 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 it's all about making people understand 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.750
 dogs that the car is not that for 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.640
 bring him to the vet already that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500
 to do the 600 kilometers to go 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.189
 to the sea so we already do it 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 in the car 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 we teach him a big one neither fresh 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 car his shooting the car and if we 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.920
 was a very small trip five 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.210
 minutes for them to perceive the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 movements in the car it's like 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 we have all your little ones in the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.810
 car in the beginning it's not very happy 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.820
 so we have to put ourselves in the place of 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.740
 dog do logical things of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.240
 little journeys to tell themselves that there is a time 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.000
 of adaptation often the first month is 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.590
 difficult and avoid going only at the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 veterinary because we often adopt 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.340
 his dog he is small he has two months 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.990
 the only outputs that makes for with the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.400
 car is to go to the veto or 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.510
 to go see the grandmother who is going very 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.610
 far because we want to show it he is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.829
 so beautiful so put back 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 simple things are used to the 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.149
 car have made short trips and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.860
 little by little the drool vomiting 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.810
 this happens and avoid giving him a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.290
 sauerkraut obviously the good ones 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.420
 croquettes to happiness and think about 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.830
 all these physiological factors and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.760
 sea ​​the male transport and if not for the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.229
 Parisians the metro if the symptoms 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.780
