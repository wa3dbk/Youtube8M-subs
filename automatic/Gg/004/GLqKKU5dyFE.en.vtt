00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.019
 good today I'm a walk of warcraft 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.540
 to teach how they put the title how 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:13.680
 get more or less about three thousand genes 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.019
 3000 gold per hour with leather goods and 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.210
 skinning screening idea 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.189
 worker for me all my life I'm going to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 teach the place where farm eo is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.339
 there where you see the little turtles there 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.949
 a lot of little turtles that 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.149
 You can ride a land of turtles 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 awesome and then you do a little bit 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:37.650
 of tufts and corners turtles 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.040
 They give exotic leather flakes primates and 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.140
 then some grays that are worth a little and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
 Grays once in a while that are worth 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.060
 six and a half one with that you spend the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 I'm afraid of being there more or less 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.460
 It's not for much but good with everything 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.650
 that I take out then I go to the house of 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.890
 auctions I start doing yes 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.930
 Great skins and patches for 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.930
 Pants good and bad 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 / sell that in the auction house and 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.290
 the greens and such take you more or less 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.100
 well, that's about 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.840
 3100 laura I'm actually going 10-15 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.840
 minutes a day I usually get some 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.540
 today for example about 860 g 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 I have taken out 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 good is what I have put of value in 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.060
 the auction house the value that I've 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.590
 total position of what I have sold with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.340
 One thing happens to me a little bit of the price 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.390
 but well about 800 that is long I've 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.540
 removed nothing 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.050
 the site where these turtles are formed 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.420
 it is here a map marks the red zone 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.760
 that red marker to the right of the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.800
 Jade forest in Padaria 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.220
 and nothing to go there and ride your 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.040
 turtle boats make them all peel 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.320
 and then go to the auction house 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.360
 make everything you can and sell 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.710
 what has made you what's left if 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.010
 you want 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.600
 I hope the video serves as a setting and 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.600
 tomorrow more until tomorrow
