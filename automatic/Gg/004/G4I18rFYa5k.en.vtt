00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
we'll go ahead and take an inch and a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.860 
we'll go ahead and take an inch and a
half<00:03:14.560> off<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.160> top<00:03:15.400> here<00:03:15.670> say<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.000> we'll

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
half off the top here say that we'll

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.580 
half off the top here say that we'll
need<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.170> would<00:03:17.349> would<00:03:17.709> later<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:19.590> and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
need that would would later on and and

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.559 
need that would would later on and and
with<00:03:21.010> any<00:03:21.160> luck<00:03:21.370> we'll<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.940> nice<00:03:22.150> clean

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
with any luck we'll have a nice clean

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.130 
with any luck we'll have a nice clean
face<00:03:22.959> with<00:03:22.989> no<00:03:23.410> checks<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.930> thirty<00:03:25.930> two

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
face with no checks and thirty two

face with no checks and thirty two
percent<00:03:26.319> plus<00:03:26.890> moisture<00:03:27.519> content

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.470 

what<00:04:02.900> I've<00:04:02.990> decided<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.500> do<00:04:03.740> is<00:04:04.150> remail<00:04:05.150> these

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
what I've decided to do is remail these

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.740 
what I've decided to do is remail these
two<00:04:05.690> planks<00:04:06.200> into<00:04:07.180> about<00:04:08.180> two<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.690> three

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
two planks into about two and three

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.470 
two planks into about two and three
eighths<00:04:09.110> two<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.620> an<00:04:09.710> eighth<00:04:09.830> inch<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.910> guess

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
eighths two and an eighth inch I guess

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.520 
eighths two and an eighth inch I guess
would<00:04:11.570> be<00:04:11.690> about<00:04:11.900> two<00:04:12.080> hundred<00:04:12.140> eight<00:04:12.380> that's

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
would be about two hundred eight that's

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.310 
would be about two hundred eight that's
when<00:04:12.740> we're<00:04:12.860> done<00:04:13.010> thick<00:04:13.820> planks<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.600> and

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
when we're done thick planks and and

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.740 
when we're done thick planks and and
later<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.830> after<00:04:16.070> they're<00:04:16.340> dried<00:04:16.670> and<00:04:17.150> dressed

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
later on after they're dried and dressed

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.949 
later on after they're dried and dressed
up<00:04:17.959> I'll<00:04:18.320> glue<00:04:18.620> them<00:04:18.859> back<00:04:18.890> together<00:04:19.250> and

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
up I'll glue them back together and

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.960 
up I'll glue them back together and
we'll<00:04:20.959> mill<00:04:21.200> on<00:04:21.440> down<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.190> final<00:04:22.640> three

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
we'll mill on down to the final three

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.730 
we'll mill on down to the final three
inches<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.940> can<00:04:26.150> say<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.480> rule<00:04:26.840> of<00:04:27.020> thumb<00:04:27.290> is<00:04:27.560> is

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
inches you can say a rule of thumb is is

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.320 
inches you can say a rule of thumb is is
that<00:04:28.180> if<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.660> have<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.980> thickness<00:04:31.790> of<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
that if you have the thickness of the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.960 
that if you have the thickness of the
wood<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:33.530> might<00:04:33.940> cut<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.120> drying<00:04:35.450> time<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.940> a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
wood you might cut the drying time to a

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.030 
wood you might cut the drying time to a
third<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.630> what<00:04:39.170> otherwise<00:04:39.500> would<00:04:39.650> have<00:04:39.920> been

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
third of what otherwise would have been

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.170 
third of what otherwise would have been
so<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.450> maple<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.620> soft<00:04:43.040> maple<00:04:43.280> dries<00:04:43.790> fairly

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
so and maple a soft maple dries fairly

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.470 
so and maple a soft maple dries fairly
rapidly<00:04:45.280> actually<00:04:46.280> much<00:04:46.700> more<00:04:46.940> rapidly<00:04:47.390> than

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
rapidly actually much more rapidly than

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.380 
rapidly actually much more rapidly than
many<00:04:47.780> other<00:04:47.990> woods<00:04:48.290> so<00:04:49.220> what<00:04:49.550> I'm<00:04:49.700> trying<00:04:50.090> to

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
many other woods so what I'm trying to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.600 
many other woods so what I'm trying to
do<00:04:50.570> here<00:04:50.600> is<00:04:51.020> get<00:04:51.230> down<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.710> about<00:04:52.190> an<00:04:52.460> eighth

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
do here is get down to about an eighth

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.880 
do here is get down to about an eighth
fourth<00:04:53.120> sic<00:04:53.600> thickness<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.660> dry<00:04:56.660> them<00:04:56.990> a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
fourth sic thickness and dry them a

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.610 
fourth sic thickness and dry them a
normal<00:04:58.700> drying<00:04:59.330> schedule<00:04:59.930> of<00:05:00.740> rates<00:05:01.070> and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
normal drying schedule of rates and

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.330 
normal drying schedule of rates and
attempt<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.820> by<00:05:04.820> fall<00:05:05.120> by<00:05:05.780> early<00:05:06.110> fall<00:05:06.380> have

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
attempt to by fall by early fall have

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.630 
attempt to by fall by early fall have
these<00:05:07.669> planks<00:05:08.450> ready<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.190> glue<00:05:10.190> back<00:05:10.430> together

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
these planks ready to glue back together

00:05:10.640 --> 00:06:43.640 
these planks ready to glue back together
into<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.919> pair<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:12.950> three-inch<00:05:13.820> thick<00:05:14.480> planks

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.610 

you<00:06:44.310> hear<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.759> lumber<00:06:45.389> into<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:45.900> kiln<00:06:46.139> you

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
you hear the lumber into the kiln you

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.790 
you hear the lumber into the kiln you
can<00:06:46.770> see<00:06:47.009> that<00:06:47.250> the<00:06:48.169> planks<00:06:49.169> have<00:06:49.259> been<00:06:49.470> sawn

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
can see that the planks have been sawn

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.730 
can see that the planks have been sawn
down<00:06:50.400> now<00:06:50.729> to<00:06:50.790> about<00:06:51.389> 8/4<00:06:51.990> little<00:06:52.440> over<00:06:52.590> 2

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
down now to about 8/4 little over 2

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.610 
down now to about 8/4 little over 2
inches<00:06:53.270> plus<00:06:54.270> we<00:06:54.539> have<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.990> one<00:06:55.289> and<00:06:55.320> a<00:06:55.470> half

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
inches plus we have the one and a half

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.560 
inches plus we have the one and a half
inch<00:06:55.889> planks<00:06:56.370> to<00:06:56.580> top<00:06:56.789> and<00:06:57.000> bottom<00:06:57.330> that<00:06:57.449> we've

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
inch planks to top and bottom that we've

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.170 
inch planks to top and bottom that we've
cut<00:06:57.810> yesterday<00:06:58.310> I've<00:06:59.310> got<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.580> baffles<00:07:00.030> all

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
cut yesterday I've got the baffles all

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.640 
cut yesterday I've got the baffles all
set<00:07:00.509> and<00:07:00.630> I'm<00:07:00.720> trying<00:07:00.930> to<00:07:01.020> keep<00:07:01.110> the<00:07:01.259> relative

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
set and I'm trying to keep the relative

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.700 
set and I'm trying to keep the relative
humidity<00:07:01.770> very<00:07:02.340> high<00:07:02.669> in<00:07:03.060> the<00:07:03.630> kiln<00:07:03.870> figure

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
humidity very high in the kiln figure

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.219 
humidity very high in the kiln figure
about<00:07:04.860> 110<00:07:05.430> degrees<00:07:05.870> dry<00:07:06.870> bulb<00:07:07.139> temperature

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
about 110 degrees dry bulb temperature

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.939 
about 110 degrees dry bulb temperature
and<00:07:07.889> a<00:07:08.460> dew<00:07:08.610> point<00:07:08.690> very<00:07:09.690> high<00:07:09.960> high<00:07:10.500> relative

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
and a dew point very high high relative

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.040 
and a dew point very high high relative
humidity<00:07:11.030> what<00:07:12.030> that<00:07:12.180> does<00:07:12.360> is<00:07:12.539> it<00:07:12.690> heats<00:07:12.870> the

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
humidity what that does is it heats the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.840 
humidity what that does is it heats the
wood<00:07:13.229> up<00:07:13.440> allows<00:07:13.770> moisture<00:07:14.280> to<00:07:14.370> move<00:07:14.550> from<00:07:14.729> the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
wood up allows moisture to move from the

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.820 
wood up allows moisture to move from the
center<00:07:15.300> but<00:07:15.840> when<00:07:15.990> it<00:07:16.080> gets<00:07:16.289> to<00:07:16.500> the<00:07:16.620> surface

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
center but when it gets to the surface

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.760 
center but when it gets to the surface
it<00:07:17.280> doesn't<00:07:17.639> dry<00:07:17.850> off<00:07:18.090> so<00:07:18.389> and<00:07:19.289> you<00:07:19.500> see<00:07:19.530> the

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
it doesn't dry off so and you see the

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.860 
it doesn't dry off so and you see the
fans<00:07:20.039> up<00:07:20.310> there<00:07:20.580> it<00:07:21.180> will<00:07:21.240> circulate<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:21.840> air

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
fans up there it will circulate the air

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.040 
fans up there it will circulate the air
and<00:07:23.000> go<00:07:24.000> around<00:07:24.210> the<00:07:24.300> other<00:07:24.389> side<00:07:24.479> you<00:07:24.900> can<00:07:25.020> see

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.050 
and go around the other side you can see

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.439 
and go around the other side you can see
my<00:07:25.320> temperature<00:07:25.710> control<00:07:26.100> mechanism<00:07:26.729> which

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
my temperature control mechanism which

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:34.070 
my temperature control mechanism which
is<00:07:27.660> simply<00:07:28.350> a<00:07:29.000> big<00:07:30.000> tarp<00:07:30.620> lay<00:07:31.620> it<00:07:31.740> across<00:07:33.080> so

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
is simply a big tarp lay it across so

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.420 
is simply a big tarp lay it across so
I've<00:07:34.229> got<00:07:34.380> about<00:07:34.560> a<00:07:34.620> quarter<00:07:35.250> of<00:07:35.630> the<00:07:37.430> surface

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 
I've got about a quarter of the surface

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.439 
I've got about a quarter of the surface
of<00:07:38.729> the<00:07:38.789> collector<00:07:40.310> actually<00:07:41.310> transparent<00:07:42.210> to

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:42.449 
of the collector actually transparent to

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.390 
of the collector actually transparent to
the<00:07:42.509> sunlight<00:07:42.810> and<00:07:43.050> we'll<00:07:43.770> take<00:07:44.009> a<00:07:44.039> look<00:07:44.250> and

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 
the sunlight and we'll take a look and

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.640 
the sunlight and we'll take a look and
if<00:07:44.520> that<00:07:45.090> needs<00:07:45.539> any<00:07:45.780> adjustment<00:07:46.349> I<00:07:46.470> can

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
if that needs any adjustment I can

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.290 
if that needs any adjustment I can
simply<00:07:46.949> move<00:07:47.099> the<00:07:47.280> tarp<00:07:47.550> around<00:07:47.910> a<00:07:48.000> little<00:07:48.090> bit

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 
simply move the tarp around a little bit

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.939 
simply move the tarp around a little bit
little<00:07:49.229> crude<00:07:49.530> but<00:07:49.560> it<00:07:50.370> works<00:07:50.610> and<00:07:50.970> doesn't

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:51.949 
little crude but it works and doesn't

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.770 
little crude but it works and doesn't
doesn't<00:07:52.949> use<00:07:53.220> up<00:07:53.250> any<00:07:53.639> additional<00:07:54.210> energy

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 
doesn't use up any additional energy

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.200 
doesn't use up any additional energy
from<00:07:55.229> the<00:07:55.349> power<00:07:55.500> company<00:07:56.099> fall<00:07:56.610> from<00:07:56.849> the<00:07:56.970> Sun

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.210 
from the power company fall from the Sun

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.450 
from the power company fall from the Sun
so<00:07:57.840> I<00:07:57.870> think<00:07:57.990> it's<00:07:58.229> a<00:07:58.289> good<00:07:58.440> thing<00:07:58.680> so<00:07:59.340> let's

00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 
so I think it's a good thing so let's

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.830 
so I think it's a good thing so let's
keep<00:07:59.580> our<00:07:59.760> fingers<00:08:00.060> crossed<00:08:00.090> that<00:08:00.570> this

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 
keep our fingers crossed that this

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:12.640 
keep our fingers crossed that this
drying<00:08:01.110> process<00:08:01.740> goes<00:08:02.310> nice<00:08:02.550> and<00:08:02.580> smoothly

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:12.650 

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.710 

you
