00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.749 
wanted them to jump on us in the late
game<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.770> dead<00:01:50.250> fire<00:01:50.460> grass

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
game because we can just dead fire grass

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
game because we can just dead fire grass
my<00:01:51.409> altas<00:01:52.409> mordekaiser<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.310> everything<00:01:54.119> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
my altas mordekaiser and everything in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.920 
my altas mordekaiser and everything in
one<00:01:54.659> target<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> clone<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
one target so we can get the clone and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.260 
one target so we can get the clone and
then<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> clone<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.969> easy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
then if we get the clone then it's easy

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
then if we get the clone then it's easy
when<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.780> us<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:02.040> effectively

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
when for us I think but effectively

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
when for us I think but effectively
didn't<00:02:03.210> even<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> corn<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.530> many

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
didn't even get the corn off that many

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.740 
didn't even get the corn off that many
times<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> wasn't<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.640> necessary<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
times it wasn't really necessary and I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
a thought about frontal in the top lane

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.180 
a thought about frontal in the top lane
is<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:32.140> something<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.470> zazzle<00:04:32.770> says<00:04:33.040> maybe

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
is it something that zazzle says maybe

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.920 
is it something that zazzle says maybe
one<00:04:33.430> because<00:04:33.670> obviously<00:04:33.850> played<00:04:34.180> renekton

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930
