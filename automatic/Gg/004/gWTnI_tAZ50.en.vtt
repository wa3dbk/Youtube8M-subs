00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.210 
not to require a garlic glue add some
salt<00:01:38.080> we're<00:01:39.040> going<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.430> at<00:01:39.550> about<00:01:41.100> half<00:01:42.100> a

salt we're going in at about half a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.120 
salt we're going in at about half a
teaspoon<00:01:43.230> and<00:01:44.230> you<00:01:44.470> guessed<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:45.420> mash<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:51.100> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
teaspoon and you guessed it mash I use a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.190 
teaspoon and you guessed it mash I use a
lime<00:01:51.460> not<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.970> because<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.750> give<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.050> flavor

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
lime not just because to give it flavor

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.770 
lime not just because to give it flavor
but<00:01:53.680> also<00:01:53.710> because<00:01:54.400> when<00:01:54.640> an<00:01:54.820> avocado<00:01:55.180> gets

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
but also because when an avocado gets

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.260 
but also because when an avocado gets
into<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.260> air<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:57.130> oxidizes<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.910> it<00:01:58.000> turns

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
into the air it oxidizes and it turns

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.020 
into the air it oxidizes and it turns
brown<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:58.870> it<00:01:58.930> keeps<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.440> avocado<00:02:00.040> having<00:02:00.940> a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
brown so it keeps the avocado having a

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.090 
brown so it keeps the avocado having a
nice<00:02:01.270> vibrant<00:02:01.840> fresh<00:02:02.140> green<00:02:02.500> color
