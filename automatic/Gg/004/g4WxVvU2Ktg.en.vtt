00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.750
 hello people welcome to another video this 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.000
 that I bring you here the new drink that 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.500
 added treyarch to this new map of 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.950
 downloadable content you know eddie 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.870
 wright 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.210
 rice or whatever it's called and that's where 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.410
 you have there is called who is who of 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.449
 agreement there you have who is who 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.859
 It costs 2000 to buy it and good now 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.419
 you will see its function and so on when the 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.749
 buy everything else just tell 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.699
 that will not always be here in this 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.439
 elevator according and many times that 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.990
 the improvement in question is not in this 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.539
 elevator may here come out then as 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.130
 it's called quick recharge or what's it called 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.160
 that and well here I take it as you can 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.840
 see and that icon comes out there as a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.270
 interconnection with two white bands in 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.280
 a blue background and good now you will see which one 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.260
 is the effect of this drink that the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.700
 truth is that it is quite useful 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.020
 here you have it see estila ronald 13 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.270
 fooling around with a clamor and like 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.650
 no thanks to one of my stupidities 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.480
 well there I am charged by another horde and I die 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.640
 thanks to that I stay here locked up and 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.650
 what has happened do not write and it's nothing 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.970
 I'm there I'm moving, I 'm left in 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.220
 Last battle as a piggy and good 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.059
 this is the function of who is who 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.530
 unfortunately obviously this is a lot 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.670
 more useful and I'm playing with someone else 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.890
 here I am playing alone 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.939
 and try to revive me it is impossible to 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.020
 function of who is who is 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.170
 basically you have an opportunity 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.259
 to revive you and if you have encouragement to you 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 same agree basically good you go 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.710
 to see that I do not get reanimated but 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.310
 I know what happens if you cheer up if you 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 you basically animate 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 I think all you're left with as 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.720
 did with all the parquets that you already had 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.670
 that is, with all the advantages 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.130
 removing I think also resuscitation 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.470
 so good here something strange happens I do not know 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 If you need to be encouraged or do not believe 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.799
 there is no need even you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.850
 animes because I can not revive 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.649
 because I have too many zombies 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.110
 following me that you can see there I keep 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.850
 the coz and the juggernaut and here they give me the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 achievement or the trophy I am my best friend 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.890
 consists of die rail is revive you and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.920
 well basically I do not know exactly how 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.810
 I said 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.950
 if you need to relive tea or not but one 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.570
 I just checked that I lost 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.080
 obviously resuscitation and I've lost 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.840
 also that is the new one who is who 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.820
 but good basically it 's very useful and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.530
 I think it's pretty good this 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.060
 incorporation by agents helping them has 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.770
 I hope you hear here a 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.770
 favorites and see you next goodbye
