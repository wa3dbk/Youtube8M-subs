00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 please 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.209
 here 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 little friends, how are you? 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:22.439
 another side for tomorrow I tell you that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 wait a moment because let's see the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.170
 movie yes but I'm going to tell you because 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.300
 Fox decided to make this movie 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.309
 on fabric with polino dragon ball sits 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.420
 as many say yes obviously or 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.460
 well they have made a movie we recorded 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 until I could have possibly had more 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 clear success but many say well no 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 but then I needed more 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.780
 live more special effects I know it's 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.190
 well but could not do the forms not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920
 it could be a movie the long war z 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.630
 why because fox people only 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 I had dragon ball rights 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.399
 to see they said that if he had a lot 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 success the movie I mean the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.160
 actors while interviewing that already 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.590
 I was loved to make a trilogy 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.989
 perfect but that fucking trilogy 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.229
 had been that trilogy would have happened 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.440
 everything in only gives a good obviously 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.759
 that clear last North America everyone to 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.220
 who the fuck is he who has the rights 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.310
 what if they all have them and tell them 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.869
 not 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.670
 it is doing very well with this 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.439
 Dragonball technology we can do it 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.700
 of dragon ball z and obviously they charge 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.500
 signed or something like that for 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.829
 continue without new movies that's 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.000
 something obvious now as if I just 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.649
 have the right to down vol 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.270
 you know when you are a trailer 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.399
 that came out a while ago made by fans 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.100
 extended has also had in a 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.950
 rally cited that it was about the saga of the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.439
 years without this trailer had done 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.619
 each and every production that they wanted that 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.119
 that were the fanatics of man let's go 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.440
 to say they put money together asking 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.659
 reach people involution this 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.459
 trailer this people after this started 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.509
 to work on a few projects and 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.700
 what they wanted to do basically 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.560
 was to try to get an online series 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.420
 about dragon ball zeta work 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.659
 obviously dragon ball z rather 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.810
 good what they wanted to have 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.060
 support from people who had some kind 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.000
 of power over the weapon as for the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.310
 first do not have problems with all this 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.989
 be a voice no matter how much you use the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.280
 for profit you can have some kind 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.680
 of legal problem 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.290
 creators or with the years of rights 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.030
 well then they started looking 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.130
 obviously they were first because they 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:37.080
 clarifies if any rights that 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:37.080
 he was the right person who tells you 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.920
 we do not have the rights of the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.800
 little bag you were directed to this man be 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.209
 because they expired not because I never 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 we had the work pot rights 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.890
 that's why that movie brought a bowl 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.420
 based on transition in the poor dragon 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.300
 like a guy who goes to school in his 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.100
 home a jean movie script or the 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.120
 we have the sayings of sanz keyboard no 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.770
 Yankee ball z 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.010
 luckily, imagine 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.230
 is not going to say it has been in the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.050
 school let me stop seeing then 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.890
 now clear you enrolled the lord 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.350
 you will ask me to sign the rights 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.170
 of dragon ball z in the whole of the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.520
 franchise if the tower that means 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.620
 what if we want to see a movie 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.890
 from la gomera all things would have to 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.350
 one that would happen in Japan 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 means anything is as it may be 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.640
 disconnection with some other study 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.680
 cinematographic or not or failing that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.450
 they sell the rights are only given to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.540
 other company 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.520
 now well he wants these options in 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.070
 possible is feasible it can happen but to 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.220
 they told these guys that 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:53.090
 there is almost no interest but they did 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.520
 null that they will never do anything with 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.500
 actors about dragon ball z and it's 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.330
 understandable because there may be what 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.710
 could be done in North America one of 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.480
 some of the great movies of 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.180
 all types and some of the worst 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.879
 it's hard to make them want to do 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.260
 something yes while as percent could 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.319
 cinematically speaking 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.940
 to make a great movie because the 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.860
 true that is mythology and so on 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.229
 dragonball lends a lot to do 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.389
 a great movie but it will not go through 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.769
 seen it because the whole and says not us 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.290
 interest for the moment equal tomorrow 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.720
 changed their minds in 2019 we have 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.330
 a dragonball movie sestayo after 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.030
 to see is to remember decide to follow 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:46.100
 stop the initial but once and I stayed 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:48.979
 very bad and how three times more would be a 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.229
 way to renew the franchise and almost 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.940
 that they deposit again in the 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.460
 palestra like who says for a new 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.289
 generation of little rat children well 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.389
 What do you think of this? 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.590
 they were informed of how it was 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.590
 the situation you simply 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.080
 because they could not be that simple 46 like 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.460
 always here giving them information that 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:20.350
 I did not have the slightest idea because this 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:27.750
 I am everywhere for this and this 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:27.750
