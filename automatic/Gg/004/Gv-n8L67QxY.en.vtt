00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 i got a ps4 some time ago 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.359
 bought and this hardly used until today 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 actually I had to before destiny too 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 but I could not know 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.759
 that the game is garbage but luckily 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.230
 is the ps plus a few days ago 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.299
 version of drive body seemed 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 well she should appear since already 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.510
 two weeks now I'm waiting for the ps 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.980
 plus version but due to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
 However, it is always server issues 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.070
 not online and I pay five for that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.109
 euro per month 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.760
 where is the coal going? 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 in drugs and use or as it is 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.230
 sony means breakfast but I want the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 400 euro for the ps4 not complete 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.500
 have spent in vain 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.700
 That's why we just play 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 gone or whatever that is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.360
 is actually pronounced when I 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.789
 myself nec ok thank you game 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.410
 thanks nec is a machine-like 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.520
 which was a long time ago in one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 cave was found 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.789
 However , only his items were 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.989
 which, however, years later of 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.850
 Imagine being in a living being again 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 could be reconverted is nec 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 But not fun again 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.800
 because he becomes a weapon against the kobolde 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.210
 I'm just glad that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.710
 finally a game without weapons 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.539
 There are still shooters available 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.530
 anyway, that's why I'm glad 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.570
 complete me here for a game now 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.570
 without armor and without weapons 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.109
 you want to tell me that pictures are up 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.899
 once panzer can drive and 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.240
 are armed 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.969
 ok i do not know what i expected 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 but it was definitely not playing that way 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.530
 tips will rest on what is that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.119
 Now Cheats again you can monja 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 Also take over the whole show 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.409

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.610
 youtube man yes then I am 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.610

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.360
 Today we play super mario 3d world 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.530
 game is perfect shit about it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.209
 you really need that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.590
 do not buy it unless you need it 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.270
 maybe something to laugh and so you can 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.709
 this time as a cat but play 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.420
 otherwise it wants the same game 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.130
 Last year, really shit 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.700
 if you play the same game every year now 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.399

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.750
 I say some news make the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.149
 take call of duty if that is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.399
 really every year something completely new 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.170
 that's why there's 3d mario for me 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.610
 World no buy recommendation instead 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.260

 generally advanced week 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.490

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.260
 year so ordered you already 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.400

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.220
 grow explosively 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.920

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.600

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.910

 once hold a little higher than rtl 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.470
 I can hold something else up 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.920
 but now let's go 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.050
 on the adventure what do I see there 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.090
 in the plane a picture of princess 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:54.440

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.690
 and he is killed by arrows 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.730
 ancient relic as a final weapon 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.610
 against the kobolde is used by 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.380
 arrows killed by arrows 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.630
 it does not always have to make sense 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.090
 but that's a little bit puzzled 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.410
 to be 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.720
 no, the bridge breaks 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.610
 what should we do that 's the best 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.400
 stay right here and in the dead 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.400
 because that makes sense or 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.169
 This rock is very slippery 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.800

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.340
 boss not really well 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.169

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.030
 landing nets are armed when there is a 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.820
 weapon gives the really strong against nec 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.620
