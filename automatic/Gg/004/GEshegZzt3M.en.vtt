everybody and welcome to another Python
3<00:00:01.829> tutorial<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.490> in<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:02.760> video<00:00:03.000> we're

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
3 tutorial video in this video we're

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.390 
3 tutorial video in this video we're
gonna<00:00:03.300> be<00:00:03.449> doing<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.810> combining<00:00:04.380> two<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.190> our

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
gonna be doing is combining two of our

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.360 
gonna be doing is combining two of our
standard<00:00:05.759> library<00:00:06.210> modules<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.250> using<00:00:08.250> them

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
standard library modules and using them

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.830 
standard library modules and using them
to<00:00:08.400> parcel<00:00:08.849> website<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:09.480> we're<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.780> be

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
to parcel website so we're going to be

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.370 
to parcel website so we're going to be
using<00:00:09.990> URL<00:00:10.440> Lib<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.360> re<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:13.049> regular

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
using URL Lib and re for regular

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.890 
using URL Lib and re for regular
expression<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.660> let's<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:15.870> ahead

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
expression so with that let's go ahead

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
expression so with that let's go ahead
and<00:00:16.080> get<00:00:16.170> started<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:17.100> needing<00:00:17.340> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
and get started so we're needing to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.349 
and get started so we're needing to
import<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.359> URL<00:00:18.960> Lib<00:00:19.560> dot<00:00:19.949> request<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.000> we're

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
import a URL Lib dot request and we're

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.939 
import a URL Lib dot request and we're
also<00:00:21.539> gonna<00:00:21.960> import<00:00:22.920> URL<00:00:23.730> Lib<00:00:25.010> dot<00:00:26.010> parse

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
also gonna import URL Lib dot parse

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
also gonna import URL Lib dot parse
finally<00:00:28.949> we're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> import<00:00:29.730> our<00:00:30.179> e<00:00:30.900> for

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
finally we're going to import our e for

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.870 
finally we're going to import our e for
regular<00:00:31.710> expressions<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.430> we're<00:00:32.579> ready<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
regular expressions and we're ready to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.170 
regular expressions and we're ready to
go

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
go

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
go
so<00:00:33.809> first<00:00:33.989> we're<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> define<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.620> URL

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so first we're going to define our URL

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.100 
so first we're going to define our URL
that<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> visit<00:00:35.670> let's<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.719> ahead<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that we want to visit let's go ahead and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.729 
that we want to visit let's go ahead and
visit<00:00:37.640> HTTP<00:00:38.640> colon<00:00:39.030> slash<00:00:39.180> slash<00:00:39.739> Python

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
visit HTTP colon slash slash Python

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.750 
visit HTTP colon slash slash Python
programming<00:00:41.570> dotnet<00:00:42.950> next<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
programming dotnet next we're going to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
programming dotnet next we're going to
say<00:00:44.879> our<00:00:44.910> values<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.289> we're<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
say our values so we're going to do a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.369 
say our values so we're going to do a
search<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.280> python<00:00:47.879> programming<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
search on python programming on that so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.189 
search on python programming on that so
our<00:00:49.680> values<00:00:50.160> whoops<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.789> dictionary<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:52.370> s

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
our values whoops we dictionary is s

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.540 
our values whoops we dictionary is s
will<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.230> equal<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.570> basics<00:00:57.570> Baysox<00:00:58.550> basics

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
will be equal to basics Baysox basics

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.429 
will be equal to basics Baysox basics
and<00:01:01.100> then<00:01:02.100> we'll<00:01:02.879> say<00:01:03.090> submit<00:01:04.129> :<00:01:06.200> sir

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.260 

okay<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.340> those<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> values<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> we're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
okay so those are the values that we're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.859 
okay so those are the values that we're
going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> parse<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.760> post<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.630> we're

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
going to parse in and a post now we're

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.999 
going to parse in and a post now we're
going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> say<00:01:16.170> data<00:01:16.970> equals<00:01:17.970> URL<00:01:18.659> Lib<00:01:19.140> parsed

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
going to say data equals URL Lib parsed

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.140 
going to say data equals URL Lib parsed
URL<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> code<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> we're<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.820> encode

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
URL and code and we're going to encode

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.760 
URL and code and we're going to encode
values<00:01:24.979> I'm<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.310> data<00:01:26.610> equals<00:01:27.240> data

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
values I'm going to say data equals data

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:37.730 
values I'm going to say data equals data
died<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.220> code<00:01:32.630> utf-8<00:01:34.850> oops<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.439> then<00:01:37.439> we're

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
died and code utf-8 oops and then we're

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.670 
died and code utf-8 oops and then we're
going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> say<00:01:38.009> rec<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.670> request<00:01:39.150> equals<00:01:39.990> URL

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
going to say rec for request equals URL

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.580 
going to say rec for request equals URL
Lib<00:01:41.250> dot<00:01:41.610> request<00:01:42.479> dot<00:01:43.250> request<00:01:44.299> capital<00:01:45.299> R

Lib dot request dot request capital R

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.520 
Lib dot request dot request capital R
and<00:01:46.590> we're<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> request<00:01:47.820> of

and we're going to make the request of
URL<00:01:49.530> passing<00:01:50.130> through<00:01:50.369> data<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
URL passing through data and then the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.690

I'm not really explaining any of these
stuff<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.820> we're<00:02:03.030> typing<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.600> we've

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
stuff that we're typing because we've

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
stuff that we're typing because we've
already<00:02:04.140> covered<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.710> URL<00:02:05.040> Lib<00:02:05.219> tutorial<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
already covered the URL Lib tutorial so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210 
already covered the URL Lib tutorial so

response now RESP data for response data
equals<00:02:20.600> rest<00:02:21.140> read<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.570> then<00:02:23.950> what<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.070> want

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
equals rest read and then what we want

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.290 
equals rest read and then what we want
to<00:02:25.310> do<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.580> we're<00:02:25.700> gonna<00:02:25.760> use<00:02:25.880> regular

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
to do is we're gonna use regular

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.580 
to do is we're gonna use regular
expressions<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.930> remember<00:02:27.170> last<00:02:27.320> time

expressions so if you remember last time

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.010 
expressions so if you remember last time
what<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.160> printed<00:02:28.520> out<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:29.000> could<00:02:29.150> say<00:02:29.330> print

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.140 

rest<00:02:33.020> data<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.340> save<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.730> run<00:02:34.970> that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
rest data so we can save and run that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
rest data so we can save and run that
let's<00:02:35.450> make<00:02:35.600> sure<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.810> works<00:02:36.170> first<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
let's make sure that works first I

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.010 
let's make sure that works first I
suppose<00:02:36.980> anyway<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.030> got<00:02:38.180> all<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.450> junk

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
suppose anyway so we got all this junk

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.340 
suppose anyway so we got all this junk
right<00:02:39.460> um<00:02:40.460> but<00:02:41.030> within<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.510> junk<00:02:41.960> there's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
right um but within this junk there's

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.800 
right um but within this junk there's
some<00:02:42.680> normal<00:02:43.010> stuff<00:02:43.270> we<00:02:44.270> don't<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.600> see

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
some normal stuff we don't really see

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.230 
some normal stuff we don't really see
anything<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.500> at<00:02:46.190> least<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.610> far<00:02:46.850> for<00:02:47.090> me<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
anything here at least so far for me I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.000 
anything here at least so far for me I
don't<00:02:47.420> really<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.500> here<00:02:48.620> we<00:02:48.710> go<00:02:48.740> here

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
don't really see it but here we go here

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.110 
don't really see it but here we go here
we<00:02:49.040> got<00:02:49.220> some<00:02:49.400> math<00:02:50.300> basics<00:02:51.050> blah<00:02:51.380> blah<00:02:51.710> blah

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
we got some math basics blah blah blah

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.120 
we got some math basics blah blah blah
here's<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.210> paragraph<00:02:53.450> tag<00:02:53.960> finally<00:02:54.410> anyway<00:02:55.070> so

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
here's a paragraph tag finally anyway so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.700 
here's a paragraph tag finally anyway so
here's<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.640> paragraph<00:02:55.880> I'm<00:02:56.570> not<00:02:57.350> I'm<00:02:57.500> not

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
here's a paragraph I'm not I'm not

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.100 
here's a paragraph I'm not I'm not
seeing<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.130> opening<00:02:58.820> paragraph<00:02:59.330> tag<00:02:59.690> but

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
seeing the opening paragraph tag but

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.060 
seeing the opening paragraph tag but
you'll<00:03:00.230> have<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.380> take<00:03:00.500> my<00:03:00.650> word<00:03:00.800> for<00:03:00.830> it

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you'll have to take my word for it

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.290 
you'll have to take my word for it
there's<00:03:01.250> an<00:03:01.340> opening<00:03:01.730> paragraph<00:03:01.880> tag

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
there's an opening paragraph tag

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.570 
there's an opening paragraph tag
somewhere<00:03:02.630> anyway<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.860> idea<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.340> want<00:03:04.370> to

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
somewhere anyway the idea is we want to

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.500 
somewhere anyway the idea is we want to
parse<00:03:05.000> out<00:03:05.290> paragraph<00:03:06.290> data<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.390> generally<00:03:08.390> in

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
parse out paragraph data so generally in

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.500 
parse out paragraph data so generally in
HTML<00:03:09.080> people<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.830> know<00:03:09.860> header<00:03:10.130> 102<00:03:10.910> for

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
HTML people have you know header 102 for

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.630 
HTML people have you know header 102 for
like<00:03:11.720> big<00:03:11.930> titles<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.860> then<00:03:12.980> name<00:03:13.190> or<00:03:13.400> maybe

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
like big titles and then name or maybe

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.000 
like big titles and then name or maybe
even<00:03:13.760> had<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.060> three<00:03:14.390> then<00:03:15.230> maybe<00:03:15.410> subtitles

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
even had a three then maybe subtitles

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.710 
even had a three then maybe subtitles
had<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> three<00:03:16.430> out<00:03:16.550> of<00:03:16.580> four<00:03:16.820> maybe<00:03:17.270> header<00:03:17.510> two

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
had a three out of four maybe header two

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.430 
had a three out of four maybe header two
and<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.730> content<00:03:20.270> is<00:03:20.450> almost<00:03:20.720> always<00:03:20.960> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
and then the content is almost always a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.160 
and then the content is almost always a
paragraph<00:03:22.220> tag<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.330> know<00:03:23.360> your

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
paragraph tag just a you know your

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.150 
paragraph tag just a you know your
typical<00:03:24.350> like<00:03:25.220> this<00:03:26.560> make<00:03:27.560> some<00:03:27.740> space<00:03:30.160> you've

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
typical like this make some space you've

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.820 
typical like this make some space you've
got<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.490> paragraph<00:03:31.970> tag<00:03:32.270> like<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.290> then

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
got a paragraph tag like that then

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.610 
got a paragraph tag like that then
you've<00:03:33.920> got<00:03:34.100> content<00:03:34.730> content<00:03:35.390> content<00:03:35.720> ba<00:03:36.350> ba

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
you've got content content content ba ba

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.380 
you've got content content content ba ba
ba<00:03:36.740> ba<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.430> then<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.760> have<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.940> closing

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
ba ba and then you have a closing

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.140 
ba ba and then you have a closing
paragraph<00:03:38.780> tag<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:39.860> depending<00:03:40.370> on<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.880> site

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
paragraph tag now depending on the site

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.520 
paragraph tag now depending on the site
sometimes<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.020> might<00:03:42.200> be<00:03:42.320> slightly

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
sometimes this might be slightly

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.770 
sometimes this might be slightly
different<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:43.610> usually<00:03:43.790> it's<00:03:44.150> paragraph<00:03:44.570> tag

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
different but usually it's paragraph tag

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.630 
different but usually it's paragraph tag
of<00:03:44.900> some<00:03:45.080> sort<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:46.160> might<00:03:46.310> have<00:03:46.340> this

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
of some sort you just might have this

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.110 
of some sort you just might have this
parse<00:03:46.880> like<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.330> or<00:03:47.570> something<00:03:48.730> hmm<00:03:49.790> anyway

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
parse like this or something hmm anyway

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.330 
parse like this or something hmm anyway
moving<00:03:50.390> on<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.590> that's<00:03:51.740> what<00:03:51.860> we<00:03:51.950> want<00:03:52.190> so<00:03:52.250> we

moving on so that's what we want so we
want<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.580> use<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.700> regular<00:03:53.060> expression<00:03:53.180> that's

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
want to use a regular expression that's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.270 
want to use a regular expression that's
going<00:03:53.960> to<00:03:54.020> say<00:03:54.200> hey<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.680> want<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.100> parse

going to say hey I want to parse

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.660 
going to say hey I want to parse
everything<00:03:55.670> between<00:03:56.320> paragraph<00:03:57.320> tags<00:03:57.670> so

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
everything between paragraph tags so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.290 
everything between paragraph tags so
what<00:03:59.150> we're<00:03:59.240> going<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.420> say<00:03:59.570> is<00:03:59.780> paragraphs

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
what we're going to say is paragraphs

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.530 
what we're going to say is paragraphs
equals<00:04:02.300> read<00:04:02.750> up<00:04:03.020> find<00:04:03.470> all<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.420> what<00:04:05.420> we're

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
equals read up find all and what we're

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.440 
equals read up find all and what we're
going<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.690> do<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.959> regular<00:04:06.380> expression<00:04:06.830> and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
going to do is regular expression and

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.180 
going to do is regular expression and
the<00:04:08.450> regular<00:04:08.750> expression<00:04:09.110> we<00:04:09.200> want<00:04:09.350> is<00:04:09.650> it's

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
the regular expression we want is it's

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.620 
the regular expression we want is it's
going<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.370> be<00:04:10.430> paragraph<00:04:10.940> tags<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:11.420> like<00:04:11.540> I

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
going to be paragraph tags so like I

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.030 
going to be paragraph tags so like I
said<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:12.020> you<00:04:12.140> want<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.350> search<00:04:12.530> for<00:04:12.680> specific

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
said if you want to search for specific

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.070 
said if you want to search for specific
text<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.790> would<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.180> can<00:04:14.360> just<00:04:14.660> type<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:15.050> that

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
text you would you can just type in that

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.560 
text you would you can just type in that
specific<00:04:15.380> text<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.150> far<00:04:17.330> we're<00:04:17.540> not

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
specific text and so so far we're not

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.510 
specific text and so so far we're not
using<00:04:18.049> any<00:04:18.290> special<00:04:18.590> character<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.250> we<00:04:19.370> don't

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
using any special character so we don't

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.250 
using any special character so we don't
need<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.760> escape<00:04:20.000> anything

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
need to escape anything

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.630 
need to escape anything
and<00:04:21.350> then<00:04:21.950> uh<00:04:25.450> parentheses<00:04:26.450> can't<00:04:27.520> blanket<00:04:28.520> on

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
and then uh parentheses can't blanket on

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.360 
and then uh parentheses can't blanket on
the<00:04:28.670> name<00:04:28.850> there<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:30.230> is<00:04:30.440> where<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.980> pattern

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
the name there this is where the pattern

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.550 
the name there this is where the pattern
that<00:04:31.400> we<00:04:31.640> want<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.240> like<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.050> want<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.320> put

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
that we want so like if you want to put

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.470 
that we want so like if you want to put
let's<00:04:34.340> see<00:04:34.490> we'll<00:04:34.820> put<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.120> closing

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
let's see we'll put the closing

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.090 
let's see we'll put the closing
paragraph<00:04:35.600> so<00:04:36.470> basically<00:04:36.800> we're<00:04:36.980> saying

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
paragraph so basically we're saying

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.820 
paragraph so basically we're saying
paragraph<00:04:37.910> tag<00:04:38.180> paragraph<00:04:38.990> tag<00:04:39.230> will<00:04:39.470> be<00:04:39.560> here

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
paragraph tag paragraph tag will be here

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.770 
paragraph tag paragraph tag will be here
and<00:04:39.980> then<00:04:40.370> here<00:04:40.850> is<00:04:40.970> what<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.330> want<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.570> search

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
and then here is what you want to search

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.480 
and then here is what you want to search
for<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.530> put<00:04:42.830> between<00:04:42.950> these<00:04:43.340> little

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
for so you put between these little

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.410 
for so you put between these little
curly<00:04:43.940> braces<00:04:44.180> or<00:04:44.540> curly<00:04:44.930> braces<00:04:45.340> parentheses

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
curly braces or curly braces parentheses

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.870 
curly braces or curly braces parentheses
and<00:04:47.420> put<00:04:47.570> between<00:04:47.930> these<00:04:48.110> what<00:04:48.950> what<00:04:49.430> data<00:04:49.700> do

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
and put between these what what data do

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.550 
and put between these what what data do
we<00:04:49.910> actually<00:04:50.150> want<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.750> search<00:04:51.050> for<00:04:51.290> so<00:04:51.470> like

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
we actually want to search for so like

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.780 
we actually want to search for so like
what<00:04:51.800> is<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.010> data<00:04:52.190> we<00:04:52.400> want<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.610> output

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
what is the data we want to output

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.150 
what is the data we want to output
because<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.900> far<00:04:54.110> we're<00:04:54.320> saying<00:04:54.470> nothing<00:04:54.950> and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
because so far we're saying nothing and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.370 
because so far we're saying nothing and
but<00:04:56.000> it's<00:04:56.210> like<00:04:56.300> find<00:04:56.720> something<00:04:57.230> between

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
but it's like find something between

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.290 
but it's like find something between
paragraph<00:04:58.100> tags<00:04:58.340> but<00:04:58.730> we<00:04:58.820> have<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.030> specify

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
paragraph tags but we have to specify

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.440 
paragraph tags but we have to specify
what<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.840> something<00:05:00.410> might<00:05:00.590> be<00:05:00.620> now<00:05:01.550> my

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
what that something might be now my

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.260 
what that something might be now my
little<00:05:02.750> favorite<00:05:03.350> combination<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.820> look<00:05:05.000> for

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
little favorite combination to look for

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.440 
little favorite combination to look for
just<00:05:05.480> anything<00:05:06.230> is<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.830> period<00:05:07.520> asterisk

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
just anything is a period asterisk

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.530 
just anything is a period asterisk
question<00:05:09.200> mark<00:05:09.380> okay<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.520> that<00:05:10.970> basically

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
question mark okay so that basically

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.180 
question mark okay so that basically
means<00:05:11.810> find<00:05:12.080> me<00:05:12.290> everything<00:05:13.010> between

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
means find me everything between

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.970 
means find me everything between
paragraph<00:05:13.850> tags<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.420> so<00:05:15.140> if<00:05:15.290> we<00:05:15.410> look<00:05:15.590> back<00:05:15.770> at

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
paragraph tags and so if we look back at

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.610 
paragraph tags and so if we look back at
what<00:05:16.640> these<00:05:16.940> characters<00:05:17.390> actually<00:05:18.110> mean<00:05:18.350> the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
what these characters actually mean the

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.930 
what these characters actually mean the
period<00:05:19.580> is<00:05:21.160> basically<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.340> period<00:05:22.670> is<00:05:22.790> going

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
period is basically the period is going

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.720 
period is basically the period is going
to<00:05:23.060> say<00:05:23.320> any<00:05:24.320> character<00:05:25.150> right<00:05:27.610> except<00:05:28.610> for

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
to say any character right except for

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.860 
to say any character right except for
your<00:05:28.850> new<00:05:28.970> line<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.750> asterisk<00:05:30.530> is<00:05:31.300> 0<00:05:32.300> or<00:05:32.600> more

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
your new line the asterisk is 0 or more

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.140 
your new line the asterisk is 0 or more
repetitions<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.740> if<00:05:34.010> there's<00:05:34.250> 0<00:05:34.520> that's<00:05:34.850> okay

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
repetitions so if there's 0 that's okay

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.000 
repetitions so if there's 0 that's okay
and<00:05:35.480> then<00:05:35.660> anything<00:05:36.200> more<00:05:36.530> than<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:36.740> that's

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
and then anything more than that that's

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.730 
and then anything more than that that's
fine<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.610> then<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:39.080> we're<00:05:39.260> basically<00:05:39.350> that

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
fine and then so we're basically that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.220 
fine and then so we're basically that
this<00:05:40.160> applies<00:05:40.730> to<00:05:40.760> your<00:05:41.240> period<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.900> then

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
this applies to your period and then

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.040 
this applies to your period and then
finally<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.190> question<00:05:43.670> mark<00:05:43.940> which<00:05:44.540> is<00:05:44.570> match

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
finally the question mark which is match

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.350 
finally the question mark which is match
a<00:05:46.270> 0<00:05:47.270> or<00:05:47.360> 1<00:05:47.590> repetitions<00:05:48.590> so<00:05:49.190> it's<00:05:49.910> basically

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
a 0 or 1 repetitions so it's basically

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.570 
a 0 or 1 repetitions so it's basically
finding<00:05:50.750> anything<00:05:51.380> between<00:05:51.650> paragraph<00:05:52.310> tags

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
finding anything between paragraph tags

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.300 
finding anything between paragraph tags
and<00:05:52.850> then<00:05:53.060> only<00:05:53.270> 1<00:05:53.720> 0<00:05:54.140> or<00:05:54.380> 1<00:05:54.560> repetitions<00:05:55.190> of

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
and then only 1 0 or 1 repetitions of

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.250 
and then only 1 0 or 1 repetitions of
that<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.640> then<00:05:55.760> it<00:05:55.880> will<00:05:56.030> break<00:05:56.780> because

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
that and then it will break because

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.810 
that and then it will break because
that's<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.710> end<00:05:57.830> of<00:05:57.920> your<00:05:58.010> paragraph<00:05:58.550> and

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
that's the end of your paragraph and

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.630 
that's the end of your paragraph and
then<00:05:59.120> continue<00:05:59.630> on<00:05:59.660> so<00:06:00.500> I<00:06:00.890> just<00:06:01.040> always<00:06:01.370> like

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
then continue on so I just always like

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.690 
then continue on so I just always like
when<00:06:02.210> I'm<00:06:02.300> parsing<00:06:02.660> websites<00:06:03.520> sometimes<00:06:04.520> it's

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
when I'm parsing websites sometimes it's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.070 
when I'm parsing websites sometimes it's
not<00:06:04.760> between<00:06:04.940> paragraph<00:06:05.450> tags<00:06:05.720> might<00:06:05.960> be

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
not between paragraph tags might be

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.110 
not between paragraph tags might be
between<00:06:06.200> something<00:06:06.740> else<00:06:06.920> but<00:06:07.550> though<00:06:07.730> the

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
between something else but though the

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.970 
between something else but though the
combination<00:06:08.870> of<00:06:08.930> regular<00:06:09.320> expressions<00:06:09.830> that

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
combination of regular expressions that

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.920 
combination of regular expressions that
I<00:06:10.040> will<00:06:10.280> use<00:06:10.520> is<00:06:10.760> always<00:06:11.000> a<00:06:11.030> period<00:06:11.300> asterisk

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
I will use is always a period asterisk

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.720 
I will use is always a period asterisk
question<00:06:12.290> mark<00:06:12.470> just<00:06:13.040> because<00:06:13.340> it<00:06:13.460> works<00:06:13.610> so

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
question mark just because it works so

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.320 
question mark just because it works so
well<00:06:16.240> so

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
well so

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.439 
well so
what<00:06:18.930> we'll<00:06:19.080> do<00:06:19.199> now<00:06:19.379> is<00:06:19.590> we'll<00:06:20.310> say<00:06:21.860> for<00:06:22.860> each

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
what we'll do now is we'll say for each

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:31.129 
what we'll do now is we'll say for each
P<00:06:24.449> in<00:06:25.069> paragraphs<00:06:26.870> print<00:06:27.870> each<00:06:28.650> P<00:06:29.509> okay<00:06:30.509> so

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
P in paragraphs print each P okay so

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.270 
P in paragraphs print each P okay so
let's<00:06:31.259> save<00:06:31.439> and<00:06:31.530> run<00:06:31.710> that<00:06:31.830> and<00:06:31.889> see<00:06:32.129> what<00:06:32.219> we

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
let's save and run that and see what we

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.110 
let's save and run that and see what we
