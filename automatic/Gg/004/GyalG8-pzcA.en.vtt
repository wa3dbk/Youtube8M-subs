00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.240
 but 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.990
 In this video I want to talk about my Christmas tree 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.880
 in Moscow 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.960
 It was thought about why I can not in the summer 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.300
 went adore it for what you can 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.720
 ride a bike and skateboard 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.710
 and on everything on anything one or with 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.780
 friends are not only very fun 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.670
 new great training for your muscles 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.180
 and reason to spend more time on 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.180
 fresh air 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 and indeed it just raises great 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 mood 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.530
 Misha summer important place more clothes shoes 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.840
 and accessories for me are comfortable sneakers 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.830
 expensive but beautiful glasses that are not 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.290
 it is a pity that if that is of course convenient 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.020
 backpack for walking on trips 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.620
 cycling or even for traveling 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.620
 other countries 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.180
 as you probably already know, I just donâ€™t 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.479
 can give creativity and years and it's not 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.940
 exception because i have 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.040
 free time and i can visit it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.670
 to make out a notebook and 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.380
 draw even if you don't consider yourself 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.979
 creative and hymn talented person 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.810
 I really try it all for you 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.509
 see summer is the time of new discoveries so 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.890
 don't be afraid this is very interesting 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.280
 more on my channel you can find 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.259
 many inspirational videos on this topic 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.190
 I want to show you a couple of very simple 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.320
 summer ideas 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.430
 the first is delicious ice for your 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.619
 drinks we need water berries 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.810
 filtered and also crumpled i take shape 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.729
 for ice and spread berries in it i 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.069
 spool and blueberries then go in there 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.319
 mint hands and so I decided to add 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.030
 the juice that stayed from the berries why and 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.220
 No, and then I always fill with water if 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.990
 you really want you can take a cleaver 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.240
 the owner will be far from being useful but 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.599
 maybe more delicious for you to me 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.880
 personally like just with water and then 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.120
 put it in the freezer for a couple of hours and 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 everyone is already ready and you can 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.370
 use to add your 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.930
 some water 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.180
 because in summer it is very important to drink a lot 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.490
 water and generally not only in summer 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 make it more yummy bright and 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.640
 interesting 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.290
 so that i do it don't drink much 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.930
 water 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.349
 eat 1 di 1 so for the summer or dessert 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.079
 even 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.420
 it's a smoothie start show one of 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.670
 recipes just using frozen 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.489
 berries that make it more so 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.799
 similar ice cream and cold that just 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.689
 I need to add more enemies here 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.480
 banana because it makes it more so 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.340
 creamy or sweetie and could 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680
 for example a little correction only then 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120
 mix first so she doesn't all 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.900
 scattered when you do it 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.549
 grind 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.319
 and all the smoothies are ready don't like it so much but you 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.659
 can experiment and come up 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.730
 own recipes 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.859
 And finally, I want to show you a couple 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.700
 outfits in their own and just beautiful frames 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.700

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.200
