00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.040
 Y 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.040
 today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.550
 Hello, how are you? I am Nancy and today I 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 I bring a video that I have been asked 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.560
 quite about how I eat what 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
 I care and it really is not that I 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.220
 feed me as another eating and if not for 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 eating the other has to simply me 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.510
 it seems that eating nutritiously makes us 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.519
 feel much better full of energy and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.230
 talking about energy we all know that the 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.330
 The most important meal of the day is the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.430
 breakfast and there are many myths and people that 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.589
 says how best it is not to eat breakfast or 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.870
 have a coffee and ya and although I'm not 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.790
 an expert I would not recommend at all 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 skip breakfast because when 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.969
 we have breakfast we are giving to our 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 body as the necessary nutrients 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.199
 to start the day with gasoline at 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.829
 coal so today I'm going to share with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.239
 you three easy nutrition ideas and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.519
 delicious that you can use as 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 options for your breakfast if you think 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.440
 are you interested in this video then do not you 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.450
 takeoffs and let's start for this 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.610
 first recipe you're going to need two other 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.660
 banana strawberries 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 oat flakes and natural yogurt without 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.140
 sugar 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 The first thing I will do is cut the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.990
 strawberries in small slices and then I'll 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.409
 to do exactly the same with the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.409
 banana 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.700
 for oat flakes on yogurt 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.120
 natural and cover this with slices of 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.120
 fruits 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.400
 and you have a super easy breakfast 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.400
 nutritious and very quick to prepare 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.430
 i 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.970
 for the second recipe you will need 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.770
 a banana almonds or nuts and this is 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.680
 totally optional but I will 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.290
 I highly recommend blueberries a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.030
 little bit of honey and the type of milk that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.250
 you may prefer soy 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.910
 allamy delayed what you choose 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.910
 it's going to be OK 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.870
 Now I'm going to pour all the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.870
 ingredients in the blender 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.480
 and we will proceed to liquefy this mixture 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.519
 when it's ready, serve it in a small glass 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.780
 and I like to put some almonds 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.780
 over to decorate 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.590
 if you are that kind of person who does not 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.660
 they like to eat something solid in the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.770
 mornings then this is mud and it 's 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.770
 perfect for you 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.410
 Finally if you want a breakfast more 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.590
 elaborated then you're going to need a 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.210
 avocado bread of your choice 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.980
 I'm going to use whole grain bread 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.980
 and a new kitchen 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.240
 what you are going to do with the avocado is 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.709
 take a little and helped with a fork 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.709
 you're going back manita 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.269
 you can add a little salt if you want 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.800
 and when you're ready you 're going to put this 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.800
 mix on your bread 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.570
 cut the egg into slices and we're 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.570
 ready to serve 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.769
 Take your bread with avocado, put slices 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.390
 of egg on top and I wanted to open a 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.390
 little tomato to decorate 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.310

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.020
