the mix that is going to change zombies
completely<00:04:16.650> but<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.370> good<00:04:17.519> way<00:04:18.079> there<00:04:19.079> is<00:04:19.260> a

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
completely but in a good way there is a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.879 
completely but in a good way there is a
lot<00:04:19.829> they<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.070> do<00:04:20.430> with<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.450> know<00:04:21.889> you

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
lot they can do with this you know you

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.149 
lot they can do with this you know you
might<00:04:23.099> need<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.849> map<00:04:24.419> control<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.260> maybe

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
might need to have map control and maybe

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.100 
might need to have map control and maybe
have<00:04:26.550> control<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.090> certain<00:04:27.360> places<00:04:27.690> like<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
have control of certain places like the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.709 
have control of certain places like the
mystery<00:04:28.469> box<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:30.030> course<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.539> pack<00:04:30.690> a

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
mystery box and of course the pack a

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.589 
mystery box and of course the pack a
punch<00:04:31.020> machine<00:04:31.229> this<00:04:32.159> is<00:04:32.310> going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.639> be<00:04:32.789> insane

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
punch machine this is going to be insane

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.080 
punch machine this is going to be insane
so<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.650> teams<00:04:34.860> will<00:04:35.010> be<00:04:35.099> fighting<00:04:35.310> over<00:04:35.580> that

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so the teams will be fighting over that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.529 
so the teams will be fighting over that
and<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.530> why<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.039> is<00:04:38.219> good<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.820> to

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
and that is why it is good to have to

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.180 
and that is why it is good to have to
have<00:04:39.659> the<00:04:39.810> multiplayer<00:04:40.229> engine<00:04:40.620> instead<00:04:41.070> of

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
have the multiplayer engine instead of

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.339 
have the multiplayer engine instead of
the<00:04:41.310> single-player<00:04:41.700> engine<00:04:42.139> so<00:04:43.139> it's<00:04:43.260> not

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
the single-player engine so it's not

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.129 
the single-player engine so it's not
just<00:04:43.409> like<00:04:43.919> ruthless<00:04:44.729> killing<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.810> will<00:04:45.960> also

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
just like ruthless killing you will also

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.100 
just like ruthless killing you will also
need<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.500> strategize<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:48.060> come<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.510> with<00:04:48.659> like

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
need to strategize and come up with like

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.890 
need to strategize and come up with like
a<00:04:49.139> plan<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.740> win<00:04:49.889> but<00:04:50.820> like<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.210> said<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.719> don't

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.480 
a plan to win but like I said you don't
have<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.200> play<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.590> if<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.889> don't<00:04:53.099> want<00:04:53.310> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
have to play that if you don't want to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.110 
have to play that if you don't want to
the<00:04:54.240> regular<00:04:54.630> mode<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:54.990> still<00:04:55.229> here<00:04:55.650> um<00:04:56.120> so
