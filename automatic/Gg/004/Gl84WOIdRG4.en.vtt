gonna<00:02:28.180> tell<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.360> too<00:02:28.510> much<00:02:28.630> about<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.989> story

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
gonna tell you too much about the story

gonna tell you too much about the story
because<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.220> much<00:02:30.340> happens<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.849> book<00:02:31.060> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
because so much happens in this book and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.210 
because so much happens in this book and
I<00:02:31.209> don't<00:02:31.330> want<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.569> give<00:02:31.660> anything<00:02:31.870> away<00:02:32.019> but

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
I don't want to give anything away but

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.289 
I don't want to give anything away but
that<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.340> basically<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:34.000> was<00:02:34.209> all

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
that is basically what this was all

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.569 
that is basically what this was all
about<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.860> something<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.040> people<00:02:36.430> might

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
about and something that people might

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.600 
about and something that people might
find<00:02:36.849> strange<00:02:37.329> is<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.650> each<00:02:38.650> little<00:02:39.099> chapter

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
find strange is that each little chapter

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.789 
find strange is that each little chapter
is<00:02:39.880> from<00:02:40.840> like<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> different<00:02:41.380> year<00:02:41.739> a

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
is from like a different year a

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.180 
is from like a different year a
different<00:02:42.190> date<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.739> can't<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:44.980> kind

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
different date and so it can't be kind

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.309 
different date and so it can't be kind
of<00:02:45.220> confusing<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:46.060> wasn't<00:02:46.750> confused<00:02:47.140> by<00:02:47.260> it

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
of confusing but I wasn't confused by it

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.819 
of confusing but I wasn't confused by it
I<00:02:47.470> thought<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.739> was<00:02:47.799> really<00:02:47.980> good<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:49.410> yeah<00:02:50.410> so

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
I thought it was really good and yeah so

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.680 
I thought it was really good and yeah so
they<00:02:51.310> start<00:02:51.670> out<00:02:51.730> being<00:02:51.970> two<00:02:52.390> different

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
they start out being two different

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.120 
they start out being two different
stories<00:02:53.079> kind<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.440> were<00:02:53.560> more<00:02:53.829> than<00:02:53.860> wonderful

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
stories kind of were more than wonderful

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.039 
stories kind of were more than wonderful
more<00:02:54.370> than<00:02:54.549> two<00:02:54.760> different<00:02:55.000> stories<00:02:55.299> but<00:02:55.329> just

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
more than two different stories but just

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.539 
more than two different stories but just
separate<00:02:56.470> stories<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.010> different<00:02:57.250> people

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
separate stories of different people

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.670 
separate stories of different people
like<00:02:58.090> years<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.900> years<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.140> years<00:02:59.319> apart<00:02:59.590> but

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
like years and years and years apart but

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.199 
like years and years and years apart but
then<00:02:59.950> eventually<00:03:00.069> they<00:03:00.459> kind<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.700> catch<00:03:00.910> up<00:03:01.090> to

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
then eventually they kind of catch up to

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.550 
then eventually they kind of catch up to
each<00:03:01.299> other<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.840> everything<00:03:02.139> is<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
each other so that everything is in the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.620 
each other so that everything is in the
same<00:03:02.769> year<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.239> kind<00:03:04.359> of<00:03:04.450> cool

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
same year and so that is kind of cool

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.809 
same year and so that is kind of cool
and<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:04.959> how<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.139> worked<00:03:05.470> um<00:03:05.859> because

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
and I like how that worked um because

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.410 
and I like how that worked um because

with a book club and not everybody has
ready<00:03:43.389> yet<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:43.599> I've<00:03:44.410> only<00:03:44.590> discussed<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.130> with

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
ready yet so I've only discussed it with

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.250 
ready yet so I've only discussed it with
a<00:03:45.250> few<00:03:45.430> people<00:03:45.730> but<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.359> was<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> really<00:03:46.900> fun

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
a few people but it was a really fun

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.750 
a few people but it was a really fun
discuss<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.799> think<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.099> kind<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.340> helped<00:03:48.609> me

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
discuss I think it kind of helped me

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.569 
discuss I think it kind of helped me
like<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.750> more<00:03:49.959> because<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.650> was<00:03:50.920> discussing<00:03:51.340> it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
like it more because I was discussing it

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.990 
like it more because I was discussing it
out<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.940> footer<00:03:52.480> section<00:03:53.579> it's<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.639> really<00:03:54.819> big

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
out a footer section it's a really big

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.789 
out a footer section it's a really big
book<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.419> so<00:03:55.569> some<00:03:56.290> people<00:03:56.530> might<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:56.739> like

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
book and so some people might not like

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.800 
book and so some people might not like
it<00:03:56.950> as<00:03:57.160> much<00:03:57.190> because<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:58.329> just<00:03:58.480> kind<00:03:58.750> of

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
it as much because it just kind of

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.330 
it as much because it just kind of
there's<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.200> lot<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.380> like<00:03:59.590> character<00:03:59.829> building

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
there's a lot of like character building

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.890 
there's a lot of like character building
that's<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.669> really<00:04:00.880> as<00:04:01.000> much<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.419> action<00:04:01.780> II

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
that's not really as much like action II

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.190 
that's not really as much like action II
and<00:04:02.109> so<00:04:02.650> some<00:04:02.859> people

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
and so some people

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.720 
and so some people
think<00:04:03.349> it's<00:04:03.470> kind<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.680> boring<00:04:03.860> both<00:04:04.129> as<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.430> if

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
think it's kind of boring both as you if

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.830 
think it's kind of boring both as you if
you're<00:04:04.819> just<00:04:04.940> kind<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.120> analyzing<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.780> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
you're just kind of analyzing it and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.420 
you're just kind of analyzing it and
going<00:04:06.020> through<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.620> is<00:04:06.920> actually<00:04:07.250> really

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
going through it it is actually really

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.479 
going through it it is actually really
really<00:04:07.610> good<00:04:07.730> so<00:04:08.590> yeah<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.920> was<00:04:10.190> my<00:04:10.340> review
