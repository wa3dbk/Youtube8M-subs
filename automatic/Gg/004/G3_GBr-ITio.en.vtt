00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
twenty and this is the 64 40 milliamp

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
twenty and this is the 64 40 milliamp
hour<00:01:18.090> batteries<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:20.000> where<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
hour batteries and you can see where you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.359 
hour batteries and you can see where you
can<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> better<00:01:21.720> idea<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.369> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
can kind of get a better idea of the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.080 
can kind of get a better idea of the
difference<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:26.090> literally

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
difference you can see that literally

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
difference you can see that literally
Vice<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> twice<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> size<00:01:28.259> twice<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Vice this is twice the size twice the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
Vice this is twice the size twice the
battery<00:01:29.400> twice<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> size<00:01:30.060> thickness<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.470> put

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
battery twice the size thickness so put

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.910 
battery twice the size thickness so put
this<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> phone

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.480 

so<00:01:41.920> this<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.190> what<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.430> looks<00:01:42.580> like<00:01:44.250> did<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.370> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
so this is what it looks like did in the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.610 
so this is what it looks like did in the
phone<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.910> never<00:01:46.150> battery<00:01:46.540> too<00:01:46.810> serious

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
phone and never battery too serious

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.430 
phone and never battery too serious
doubles<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.750> when<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.930> put<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.350> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
doubles it and when you put this in the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.350 
doubles it and when you put this in the
phone<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:51.370> have<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.640> use<00:01:51.820> their<00:01:52.030> extended
