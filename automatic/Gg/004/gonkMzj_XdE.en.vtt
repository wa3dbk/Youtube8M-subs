after<00:00:05.430> I've<00:00:05.549> created<00:00:05.790> my<00:00:06.299> rosebud<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.290> turn

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
after I've created my rosebud I can turn

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.709 
after I've created my rosebud I can turn
it<00:00:07.680> into<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.069> full<00:00:08.460> flower<00:00:08.790> by<00:00:09.059> adding<00:00:09.510> layers

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
it into a full flower by adding layers

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.339 
it into a full flower by adding layers
of<00:00:10.019> five<00:00:10.650> petals<00:00:11.400> each<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.750> two<00:00:13.080> different

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
of five petals each I have two different

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.320 
of five petals each I have two different
sized<00:00:13.769> cutters<00:00:14.280> we're<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.759> start<00:00:15.150> with

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
sized cutters we're going to start with

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.900 
sized cutters we're going to start with
a<00:00:15.360> small<00:00:15.929> five<00:00:16.410> petal<00:00:16.859> cutter<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.400> begin<00:00:17.730> with

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
a small five petal cutter to begin with

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.390 
a small five petal cutter to begin with
I've<00:00:18.119> rolled<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:19.020> gum<00:00:19.199> paste<00:00:19.470> using<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
I've rolled out my gum paste using a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.519 
I've rolled out my gum paste using a
pasta<00:00:20.609> machine<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> then<00:00:21.449> cut<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.230> shape

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
pasta machine and then cut out the shape

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
pasta machine and then cut out the shape
in<00:00:23.039> order<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.400> create<00:00:23.850> petals<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.480> are<00:00:24.630> super

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
in order to create petals that are super

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.070 
in order to create petals that are super
thin<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.830> two<00:00:26.400> things<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> first<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
thin I do two things the first is to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
thin I do two things the first is to
pinch<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.830> roll<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.429> edges<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.210> technique

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
pinch and roll the edges the technique

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.500 
pinch and roll the edges the technique
that<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> use<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.070> snapping<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.030> take

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that I use is as if I'm snapping I take

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
that I use is as if I'm snapping I take
my<00:00:33.660> first<00:00:33.960> finger<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.649> thumb<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.250> pinch

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
my first finger in my thumb and I pinch

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
my first finger in my thumb and I pinch
all<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.660> around<00:00:36.989> after<00:00:37.770> I've<00:00:37.860> gone

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
all the way around after I've gone

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
all the way around after I've gone
around<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> whole<00:00:38.760> entire<00:00:39.090> flower<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
around the whole entire flower I use a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.350 
around the whole entire flower I use a
ball<00:00:40.379> tool<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.460> using<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> ball<00:00:42.120> too

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
ball tool when I'm using the ball too

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.569 
ball tool when I'm using the ball too
I'm<00:00:42.510> working<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> edge<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.370> like

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I'm working just on the edge and I like

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.880 
I'm working just on the edge and I like
to<00:00:44.760> work<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.210> ball<00:00:45.450> tool<00:00:45.750> half<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to work with my ball tool half on the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
to work with my ball tool half on the
edge<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> half<00:00:47.760> off<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.420> make<00:00:48.600> sure<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
edge and half off to make sure that I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.100 
edge and half off to make sure that I
get<00:00:49.110> nice<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> thin<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.300> want<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
get nice and thin now I don't want to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.010 
get nice and thin now I don't want to
put<00:00:52.410> too<00:00:52.770> much<00:00:52.980> ruffling<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.570> petal<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
put too much ruffling into this petal I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.569 
put too much ruffling into this petal I
just<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.829> thinning<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
just want to think about thinning the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.490 
just want to think about thinning the
edges<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.030> we'll<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.300> trace<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:58.170> around

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
edges so we'll just trace right around

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.490 
edges so we'll just trace right around
and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.309> work<00:00:59.550> across<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.510> petal<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and then work across the petal just to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.439 
and then work across the petal just to
thin<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> make<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:03.180> bit

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
thin it out and to make it a little bit

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.960 
thin it out and to make it a little bit
wider<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.439> work<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> way<00:01:05.250> around<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
wider so I work all the way around and

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780 
wider so I work all the way around and
then<00:01:06.479> roll<00:01:06.810> straight<00:01:07.320> across<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.189> thin<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.490> out

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
then roll straight across to thin it out

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.510 
then roll straight across to thin it out
after<00:01:09.780> I've<00:01:09.900> gone<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.890> way<00:01:10.920> around<00:01:11.280> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
after I've gone all the way around for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.690 
after I've gone all the way around for
all<00:01:11.670> five<00:01:12.030> petals<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.720> ready<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.680> touch<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
all five petals I'm ready to touch it to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
all five petals I'm ready to touch it to
my<00:01:15.210> butt<00:01:15.509> when<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> attach<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:16.920> bud<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
my butt when I attach it to my bud I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.570 
my butt when I attach it to my bud I
pierce<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.330> wire<00:01:18.509> through<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.619> center<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.400> my

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
pierce the wire through the center of my

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
pierce the wire through the center of my
petal<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.000> slide<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.680> bud

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
petal and slide all the way up to my bud

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
petal and slide all the way up to my bud
with<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.850> paint<00:01:24.150> brush<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.720> add<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> teeny

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
with a little paint brush I add a teeny

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
with a little paint brush I add a teeny
tiny<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.909> glue<00:01:27.210> begin<00:01:27.810> our<00:01:27.930> sugar

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
tiny little bit of glue begin our sugar

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.780 
tiny little bit of glue begin our sugar
flower<00:01:28.530> makers<00:01:28.829> tend<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.340> too<00:01:29.579> much<00:01:29.610> glue

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
flower makers tend to use too much glue

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
flower makers tend to use too much glue
so<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> use<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> little<00:01:30.930> bit<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> glue<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
so just use a little bit of glue and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490 
so just use a little bit of glue and
just<00:01:31.799> around<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> base<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.689> butt<00:01:34.079> we

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
just around the base of the butt we

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
just around the base of the butt we
don't<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> add<00:01:35.280> glue<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> top

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
don't want to add glue at the top

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.480 
don't want to add glue at the top
because<00:01:36.720> later<00:01:36.990> we're<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> paint<00:01:37.950> these

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
because later we're going to paint these

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.380 
because later we're going to paint these
rose<00:01:38.880> buds

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
rose buds

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.899 
rose buds
now<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:40.079> ready<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> put<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.159> one<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
now I'm ready to put these on one at a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.929 
now I'm ready to put these on one at a
time<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.509> start<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.590> petals<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.670> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
time I start one of my petals at one of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.210 
time I start one of my petals at one of
the<00:01:45.119> places<00:01:45.299> where<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:46.020> an<00:01:46.140> overlap<00:01:46.740> from

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

dry overnight before I add the last two
