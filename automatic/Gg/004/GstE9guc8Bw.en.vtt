00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
an individual and I think as I have

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.930 
an individual and I think as I have
gotten<00:03:54.230> older<00:03:54.440> I've<00:03:54.950> realized<00:03:55.610> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
gotten older I've realized the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.140 
gotten older I've realized the
importance<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.810> belonging

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
importance of belonging

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.830 
importance of belonging
and<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.750> really<00:03:59.170> wanted<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.620> be<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.799> part<00:04:00.159> of

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
and I really wanted to be a part of

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.259 
and I really wanted to be a part of
Ellen's<00:04:01.840> family<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.709> am<00:04:02.890> but<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.549> think<00:04:03.879> just

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
Ellen's family and I am but I think just

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.800 
Ellen's family and I am but I think just
solidifying<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.319> by<00:04:06.060> by<00:04:07.060> taking<00:04:07.599> her<00:04:08.500> name

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
solidifying that by by taking her name

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.210 
solidifying that by by taking her name
makes<00:04:10.810> me<00:04:11.140> feel<00:04:13.470> makes<00:04:14.470> me<00:04:14.709> feel<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.099> have

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
makes me feel makes me feel like I have

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.680 
makes me feel makes me feel like I have
a<00:04:15.280> family<00:04:16.229> we'll<00:04:17.229> be<00:04:17.350> right<00:04:17.500> back
