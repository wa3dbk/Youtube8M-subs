00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
to here and explore and we got about 24

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
to here and explore and we got about 24
seconds<00:02:12.110> left<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:13.610> will<00:02:13.820> have

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.020 
seconds left and then we will have
iTunes<00:02:14.270> now<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.840> cool<00:02:15.140> thing<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.550> iTunes<00:02:16.550> just

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
iTunes now the cool thing is iTunes just

iTunes now the cool thing is iTunes just
updated<00:02:17.690> there

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
updated there

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.170 
updated there
software<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.740> supposedly<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> look<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
software and supposedly the look is a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.240 
software and supposedly the look is a
lot<00:02:20.420> different<00:02:20.690> they've<00:02:21.230> updated<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.950> this

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
lot different they've updated in this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.000 
lot different they've updated in this
nicer<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.570> we'll<00:02:24.230> get<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> chance<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.800> take<00:02:24.980> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
nicer so we'll get a chance to take a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.820 
nicer so we'll get a chance to take a
little<00:02:25.250> preview<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.410> kind<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.530> look<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.800> it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
little preview of it kind of look at it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.910 
little preview of it kind of look at it
and<00:02:28.010> see<00:02:28.190> what's<00:02:28.430> different<00:02:29.260> as<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:30.620> install

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
and see what's different as we install

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.750 
and see what's different as we install
it<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.540> new<00:02:32.810> Windows<00:02:33.200> 8<00:02:33.350> computer<00:02:33.830> all

you're the administrator it may not

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
and here we are we're installing right

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.660 
and here we are we're installing right
now<00:03:24.460> this<00:03:25.460> should<00:03:25.760> take<00:03:27.100> slices<00:03:28.100> normally

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
now this should take slices normally

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.000 
now this should take slices normally
don't<00:03:28.880> take<00:03:29.060> one<00:03:29.270> of<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.450> Manitou<00:03:30.020> depending

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
don't take one of the Manitou depending

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.500 
don't take one of the Manitou depending
on<00:03:31.130> how<00:03:31.250> much<00:03:31.400> stuff's<00:03:31.700> on<00:03:31.850> your<00:03:32.030> computer

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
on how much stuff's on your computer

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.360 
on how much stuff's on your computer
obviously<00:03:32.990> if<00:03:33.470> you're<00:03:33.590> doing<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.920> Windows<00:03:34.190> 8

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
obviously if you're doing on Windows 8

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.710 
obviously if you're doing on Windows 8
you<00:03:34.520> probably<00:03:34.790> don't<00:03:34.970> have<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.120> lot<00:03:35.300> of<00:03:35.330> things

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
you probably don't have a lot of things

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.180 
you probably don't have a lot of things
on<00:03:35.900> there<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.260> far<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.340> should<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.000> quick

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
on there so far so it should be a quick

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.580 
on there so far so it should be a quick
seamless<00:03:40.190> process<00:03:40.430> here

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
seamless process here

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:59.590 
seamless process here
so<00:03:50.980> almost<00:03:51.980> done<00:03:52.460> now<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:58.340> one<00:03:59.210> more<00:03:59.360> time

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
so almost done now and one more time

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.660 
so almost done now and one more time
that's<00:03:59.810> asking<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.650> administrator<00:04:01.220> and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
that's asking for the administrator and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.640 
that's asking for the administrator and
again<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.360> probably<00:04:02.630> won't<00:04:03.020> do<00:04:03.200> that<00:04:03.380> when<00:04:03.560> you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
again it probably won't do that when you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.770 
again it probably won't do that when you
do<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:03.860> but<00:04:04.160> for<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.670> case<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:04.910> how<00:04:05.330> I've<00:04:05.510> set

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
do it but for the case of how I've set

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:20.340 
do it but for the case of how I've set
this<00:04:05.870> video<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.380> it's<00:04:06.530> asking<00:04:06.890> for<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.250> so
