00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.119
 hello welcome calculation alexis 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.750
 today we prepare our mashed potatoes 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.930
 pumpkin 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.390
 but the first step is going to be of 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.700
 cut and nine role sites so if you 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.710
 have a normal size pumpkin 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.260
 not like mine which is gigantic 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760
 you can cut it in four so if 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.070
 you have a huge pumpkin like 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.290
 that slice is there in big slices 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.780
 about 10 to 20 cm wide so I 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.089
 invites you to clean slices of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.400
 lemon with a knife like that we're going 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.769
 remove all the party in their post at 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.229
 say fibrous and the seeds of 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.299
 pumpkins have all that we remove that and 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.949
 to know what to do with the sheikh 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.449
 pumpkin or with the seeds of 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.190
 pumpkin I invite you to consult my 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.310
 emma pumpkin seeds capsule 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.580
 pumpkin soup capsule 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.010
 we want to preheat the oven to 350 degrees 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.280
 and we will place the slices of lemon 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.890
 and cook on a cookie sheet 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 simply with a sheet 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.710
 aluminum below and we will 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.290
 obviously cover up really so that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.390
 the pumpkin cook a little steam 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.020
 somehow there is no way out 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.000
 air 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.680
 so we're jailed to be pumpkin 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.070
 in aluminum and we end up at 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.560
 made 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.910
 this is the sto and the recovery is born 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.350
 in aluminum in fact what we want 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.830
 to avoid it is that the pumpkin 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.830
 dried 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.759
 that a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.400
 this is the written pumpkin so where 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.939
 it's beautiful the smoke that escapes 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.950
 we'll finally cool and damman before the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.140
 pumpkin charter on your board 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.520
 to cut and if you are brave 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.450
 you can still cut and all 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.950
 right now it's just that it's a small 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.780
 little warmer for hands as 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.140
 gloves or for having predicted as you 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.440
 feeling 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:25.180
 we will cut the skin here obviously 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.880
 it can be removed and Rasmussen will pay 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.660
 tubes actually no cube but just 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.160
 to help 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.600
 it went wrong a robot that can 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.019
 also easily depicts his shows 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.970
 even if their ideal is not to 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.739
 add water to add very little 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.450
 so if ever your robot is not 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.549
 able to reduce the load the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.560
 pumpkin mashed it's either because 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.120
 that it is not cooked enough or because 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.380
 you have to add a little bit 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.890
 of water we are talking about a tablespoon 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.810
 2 informally at this stage there you 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.760
