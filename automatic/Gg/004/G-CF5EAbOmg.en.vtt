00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
pro six with it it actually senses each

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.390 
pro six with it it actually senses each
string<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.520> its<00:02:24.700> own<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.890> song<00:02:27.070> channel

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
