to bring again I have heard a lot of
things<00:02:31.640> thrown<00:02:31.940> around<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.300> human<00:02:32.600> design

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
things thrown around in human design

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.410 
things thrown around in human design
about<00:02:33.110> this<00:02:33.260> authority<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.880> lot<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.180> people

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
about this authority and a lot of people

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.550 
about this authority and a lot of people
thought<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.660> was<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.870> very<00:02:35.930> complicated

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
thought it was a very complicated

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.450 
thought it was a very complicated
Authority<00:02:37.370> at<00:02:37.490> first<00:02:37.760> because<00:02:39.220> well<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.250> guess

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
Authority at first because well I guess

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.250 
Authority at first because well I guess
it<00:02:40.640> really<00:02:40.940> wasn't<00:02:41.300> very<00:02:41.480> well<00:02:41.780> understood

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
it really wasn't very well understood

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.930 
it really wasn't very well understood
and<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.470> don't<00:02:42.710> believe<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.580> still<00:02:43.790> not

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
and I don't believe that it's still not

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700 
and I don't believe that it's still not
very<00:02:44.000> well<00:02:44.210> understood<00:02:44.590> through<00:02:45.590> our

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
very well understood through our

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.590 
very well understood through our
experimentation<00:02:46.400> though<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.970> we've<00:02:47.180> seen

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
experimentation though that we've seen

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.360 
experimentation though that we've seen
that<00:02:47.960> what<00:02:48.230> we<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.620> really<00:02:48.860> pick<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
that what we can really pick on the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.030 
that what we can really pick on the
bodies<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> frequency<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.320> G<00:02:51.470> where<00:02:51.950> the

in the voice of the person now at first
you<00:03:02.600> know<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.810> may<00:03:03.080> want<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.710> in<00:03:03.800> touch

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
with someone like myself to be

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.660 
with someone like myself to be
experimented<00:03:06.410> with<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.560> lot<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.640> that

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
experimented with a lot of this so that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.830 
experimented with a lot of this so that
you<00:03:07.790> can<00:03:08.000> talk<00:03:08.180> through<00:03:08.240> your

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
you can talk through your

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.840 
you can talk through your
decision-making<00:03:09.470> process<00:03:10.010> but<00:03:10.550> eventually

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
decision-making process but eventually

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.600 
decision-making process but eventually
it<00:03:11.180> would<00:03:11.300> be<00:03:11.480> reliant<00:03:12.110> upon<00:03:12.470> your<00:03:12.920> own<00:03:13.130> self

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610

it would be reliant upon your own self
said<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.600> could<00:03:14.780> hear<00:03:14.989> your<00:03:15.140> own<00:03:15.380> words<00:03:15.830> and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
said you could hear your own words and

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.100 
said you could hear your own words and
your<00:03:16.520> own<00:03:16.670> truth<00:03:17.090> coming<00:03:17.480> out<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.720> yourself

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
you love and and you know that's a very

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.250 
you love and and you know that's a very
confusing<00:03:26.060> thing<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.540> know<00:03:26.630> because<00:03:26.750> again

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
confusing thing you know because again

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.810 
confusing thing you know because again
that's<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.709> center<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.040> love<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.370> direction

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
that's the center of love and direction

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.360 
that's the center of love and direction
I<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.360> see<00:03:29.750> where<00:03:30.140> somebody<00:03:30.440> might<00:03:30.800> say<00:03:31.130> that

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
I can see where somebody might say that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.880 
I can see where somebody might say that
but<00:03:31.670> when<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.570> say<00:03:32.720> only<00:03:32.870> do<00:03:33.110> what<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.440> love

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
but when you say only do what you love

but when you say only do what you love
who's<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.640> that's<00:03:35.060> doing<00:03:35.330> what<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.570> loves

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
you know that a lot that sounds to me

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.930 
you know that a lot that sounds to me
like<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.530> mind<00:03:39.770> so<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:40.430> want<00:03:40.640> people<00:03:40.820> to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.930 
like the mind so I just want people to
be<00:03:41.060> very<00:03:41.239> careful<00:03:41.780> with<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:43.459> know<00:03:43.580> some<00:03:43.820> of

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
be very careful with you know some of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.370 
be very careful with you know some of
the<00:03:44.030> things<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.750> are<00:03:44.840> being<00:03:44.930> thrown<00:03:45.050> around

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
the things that are being thrown around

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.280 
the things that are being thrown around
out<00:03:46.010> there<00:03:46.040> about<00:03:46.280> G<00:03:46.640> Authority<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.360> know<00:03:47.720> that

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
out there about G Authority I know that

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.990 
out there about G Authority I know that
it<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.560> be<00:03:48.709> accessed<00:03:49.160> through<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.430> frequency

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
it can be accessed through the frequency

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.060 
it can be accessed through the frequency
of<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.180> noise<00:03:50.390> there<00:03:51.019> is<00:03:51.050> no<00:03:51.200> doubt<00:03:51.680> in<00:03:51.980> our

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
of the noise there is no doubt in our

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.009 
of the noise there is no doubt in our
experimentation<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.360> works<00:03:53.660> for<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
experimentation that that works for the

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.590 
experimentation that that works for the
beating<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:55.430> over<00:03:55.850> time<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.480> they

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
beating and that over time that they

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.020 
beating and that over time that they
start<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.900> develop<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:58.010> know<00:03:58.100> almost<00:03:58.430> they

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
start to develop you know almost they

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.820 
start to develop you know almost they
can<00:03:59.180> feel<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.600> trajectory<00:04:00.170> change<00:04:00.470> because

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
can feel the trajectory change because

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.380 
can feel the trajectory change because
it's<00:04:01.010> literally<00:04:01.519> something<00:04:01.820> that's<00:04:02.120> pulling

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
it's literally something that's pulling

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.810 
it's literally something that's pulling
them<00:04:02.720> along<00:04:02.989> in<00:04:03.019> their<00:04:03.320> trajectory<00:04:03.860> if<00:04:04.640> you

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
them along in their trajectory if you

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.150 
them along in their trajectory if you
have<00:04:05.000> G<00:04:05.300> Authority<00:04:05.870> look<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:06.680> going<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.980> take

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
have G Authority look it's going to take

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.790 
have G Authority look it's going to take
you<00:04:07.310> time<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:08.780> means<00:04:09.140> you're<00:04:09.350> enough<00:04:09.560> that

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
you time it means you're enough that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.190 
you time it means you're enough that
you're<00:04:10.040> you're<00:04:10.519> a<00:04:10.550> projector<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.720> means<00:04:11.989> that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
you're you're a projector it means that

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.900 
you're you're a projector it means that
the<00:04:12.320> study<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.650> your<00:04:12.890> aura<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.550> who<00:04:14.060> sees<00:04:14.420> you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
the study of your aura and who sees you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.030 
the study of your aura and who sees you
and<00:04:15.240> what<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.930> see<00:04:15.960> is<00:04:16.530> way<00:04:16.770> more

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
and what you can see is way more

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.130 
and what you can see is way more
important<00:04:17.700> than<00:04:17.850> trying<00:04:18.480> to<00:04:18.600> understand<00:04:19.050> this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
important than trying to understand this

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.560 
important than trying to understand this
authority<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:19.950> authority<00:04:20.430> will<00:04:20.610> emerge<00:04:20.970> it

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
authority this authority will emerge it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.410 
authority this authority will emerge it
will<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.050> self<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.790> emerges<00:04:23.790> out<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
self projected projector will be the one

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.200 
self projected projector will be the one
that's<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.280> really<00:04:41.580> recognize<00:04:41.880> the

that's here to really recognize the
truth<00:04:42.780> for<00:04:43.290> yourself

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
truth for yourself

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.460 
truth for yourself
and<00:04:44.670> until<00:04:45.000> then<00:04:45.210> having<00:04:45.690> another<00:04:46.200> good

projector to in your life to talk to
could<00:04:48.750> be<00:04:48.930> very<00:04:49.140> beneficial<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.430> do

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
could be very beneficial and I do

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.660 
could be very beneficial and I do

recommend it I hope that helps because

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.360 
recommend it I hope that helps because
it<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> less<00:04:55.020> understood<00:04:55.620> Authority<00:04:56.160> in
