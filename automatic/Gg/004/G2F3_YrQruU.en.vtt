00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 it cost nothing 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.720
 the load was deteriorated 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.810

 the first chapel that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
 It was placed near tepeyac well 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.430
 in that moment he spoke as he does destructive it was called attention 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.300
 for people who have existed since then 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.760

 complaint in the tepeyac extra daily appeared 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.790
 and then a copy of the altarpiece of the Virgin of Guadalupe is given that the central part 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.850
 It is known who was 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.490
 the package everything is known who was the painter the sculptor that we are before 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.040
 we are already looking for the part not only the oral tradition is invoked 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.950
 let's go to the documentary part in 8 currency or we are seeing 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.410
 to know what we know is the seats 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.910
 from the 16th century from here some missions were made that went to 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.860
 querétaro and then do what the only company 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.050
 the secondary ccf 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.830
 and airplane explanation of why this chapel 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 I was in this place 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.680
 although the young people had to learn that they were going to read what gospels were going to 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.490
 read 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.130
 the message of consulted an inner child by the way 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.250
 of life every step they take they will take it with 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.460
 the best 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.280
 with his staff the best decision was consulted 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.770
 to that good-natured part in good faith to continue on their way 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.670
 and one side to another altarpiece go remembering them perez díaz 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.120
 phelps that every Sunday in which 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.510
 Christ overcomes death for him 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 the seat of the resurrection we have those two titles 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.410
 it is clear that they are brought as if 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.050
 and part of the doctrine 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.409
 it does not matter that we do not know who was different the truth is that he 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.049
 I insist in spite 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.929
 of the damages that these fights have suffered 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 it attracts us do not occur because of its beauty 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.379
 yesterday it is extremely deteriorated 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.519
 who wants to insist on that because maybe at the moment of asking for help before 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.149
 that there was a perrier 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.769
 something like that 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.389
 for him some requests have been made 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.349
 to the national institute of ecology for what 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.889
 was they support them percent with their restorers off or authorize so that 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.729
 other people of good will 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.349
 are willing to help return rescue this kind of 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.379
 title 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.309
 I'm not talking about people of good will 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.919
 you believe that the inhabitants of the condominiums that surround this chapel 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.739
 is to contribute attached and wants this place I know it is not your 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.099
 responsibility but finally they have elite my physio 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.649
 the Iraqi 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.979
 well done 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.669
 if they would be willing why 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.209
 the decision entitles him as a child to protect 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.209
 this chapel that makes us jointly responsible 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.909
 is to admire and do something for this with dominance however 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.279
 it's like 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:27.399
 of legarra in the person is responsibilities and finally 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.599
 the authorization that divine to win any 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.889
 the arrangement any Baptist confession can not be touched can not be touched 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.889
 the inah would have to 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.189
 also the community has to 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.639
 reply 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.719
 to the effort of the authority 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.290
 I'm going to feel like we're going back in time when we got here to 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.719
 ask the virgin 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.150
 to help us here there are those who save this chapel 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.189
 after all 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.279
 it is a very valuable part of our history it does not seem 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.569
 in the baths of the rock there are several cabinets like this one 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.459
 here people come to immerse themselves in medicinal waters 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.609
 to receive massage and of course to rest 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.650
 give massage to attend a person who comes who is all an art an art that dominates 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.960
 with the girls 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.400
 I wanted to start working as a bathtub 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.599
 in 1957 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:29.830
 that in memory 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.870
 this end on the contrary the bathroom accompany 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.439

 success as it leads to work here 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.949

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.080
 payano affirmed ralph simon the light bulb 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.599

 palestra and many lacks exit 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.819
 there is no water there was no light but some villages there was no language 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.120
 there were no new life magazines

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.150

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
 because they spoke Spanish very badly 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.449
 they showed 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.999
 because the alarm
