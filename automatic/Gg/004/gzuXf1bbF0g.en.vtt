now from our man Jefferies Jeff he

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.030 
now from our man Jefferies Jeff he
actually<00:03:48.810> went<00:03:49.050> right<00:03:49.440> over<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.890> his<00:03:50.010> ankle

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.310 

a<00:05:48.190> great<00:05:48.790> result<00:05:49.060> which<00:05:49.480> they<00:05:49.660> managed<00:05:50.020> from

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
a great result which they managed from

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.860 
a great result which they managed from
this<00:05:50.590> very<00:05:50.950> very<00:05:51.460> late<00:05:51.730> goal<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:52.720> thought

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
this very very late goal and I thought

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.630 
this very very late goal and I thought
the<00:05:53.050> losing<00:05:53.410> team<00:05:53.620> were<00:05:53.830> beginning<00:05:54.250> to<00:05:54.370> tire

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
the losing team were beginning to tire

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.910 
the losing team were beginning to tire
towards<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.270> end<00:05:55.390> maybe<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.930> concern<00:05:56.620> for<00:05:56.650> the

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
towards the end maybe a concern for the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.210 
towards the end maybe a concern for the
manager<00:05:57.280> needs<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.610> work<00:05:57.760> on<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.030> fitness
