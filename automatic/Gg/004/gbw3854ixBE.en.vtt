 is the FC St 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.089

 I can not really talk at night 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.630
 In recent years, Scoach has been the winner 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 But statements get closer 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.160
 is too exhausting for me anyway to wander through 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.460
 At the same time, the core sentence resembled that of almost every other man

 Because of his credentials, we never miss the chance to receive support

 To get training place 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.270
 that was not his 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.060
 Today the terrain is that it means further and because the water is not over 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.110
 Night Red the second candidate is a real disadvantage will be the 21-year-old

 test 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.560
 and what to do 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.090
 we are here

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.900
 l have people 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.360
 it already partly made after so we already have example 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.580
 and percent divorce that he is the 4th

 the youth we have today we only have this agreement because of the persistent

 and for anyone who can give the chance for him to come to the exhibition 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.850
 Alissa double chance for himself and I'm sure if that

 hopelessly appearing Phelps in 1 first hit 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.979
