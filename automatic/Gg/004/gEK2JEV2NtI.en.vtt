mix<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:20.789> using<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.330> mix<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> flour<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.289> water

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
mix we're using a mix of flour and water

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.210 
mix we're using a mix of flour and water
but<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.609> could<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.240> wallpaper<00:00:25.019> paste<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.740> PVA

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
but you could use wallpaper paste or PVA

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.529 
but you could use wallpaper paste or PVA
and<00:00:26.340> water<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:28.830> take<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.760> paper<00:00:29.939> cut<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and water you take your paper cut and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.370 
and water you take your paper cut and
cut<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.920> end<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.350> looks

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
cut out the end right here so it looks

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.799 
cut out the end right here so it looks
like<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:35.690> hard<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> because

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
like this very hard to do it because

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.950 
like this very hard to do it because
it's<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> small<00:00:40.170> space<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
it's a small space and it's a so you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
it's a small space and it's a so you
just<00:00:43.170> stab<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> hole<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:50.000> just

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just stab a hole and then you can just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:06.969 
just stab a hole and then you can just
cut<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.850> doesn't<00:00:54.059> need<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.510> perfect

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.070 

now<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.280> save<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:09.900> need<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
now you can save like that you need to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.030 
now you can save like that you need to
put<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.890> cup<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> top<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> bar<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:13.040> tape

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
put one cup on top of the bar and tape

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:37.800 
put one cup on top of the bar and tape
it<00:01:14.070> tape<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.210> edges<00:01:15.810> together

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.200 

now<00:01:38.810> it's<00:01:39.260> starting<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.800> look<00:01:40.400> more<00:01:40.460> like<00:01:40.880> an

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
now it's starting to look more like an

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.670 
now it's starting to look more like an
African<00:01:41.540> drum<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:43.640> next<00:01:43.940> step<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.680> to

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
African drum the next step is to

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.880 
African drum the next step is to
papier-mache<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:48.260> only<00:01:48.410> need<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.740> do<00:01:48.860> one

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
papier-mache it you only need to do one

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.350 
papier-mache it you only need to do one
layer<00:01:49.570> around<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.590> body<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.220> around<00:01:53.150> the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
layer around the body of it around the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.950 
layer around the body of it around the
rim<00:01:55.810> rip<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.110> paper<00:01:58.060> into<00:01:59.060> smaller<00:01:59.390> sections

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
rim rip the paper into smaller sections

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.610 
rim rip the paper into smaller sections
and<00:02:00.850> use<00:02:01.850> two<00:02:02.270> or<00:02:02.420> three<00:02:02.690> layers<00:02:02.930> around<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
and use two or three layers around the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
and use two or three layers around the
rim

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.080

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
wipe off any like excess stuff because

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.800 
wipe off any like excess stuff because
the<00:02:25.510> wetter<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.550> longer<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.180> will<00:02:28.270> take<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the wetter is the longer it will take to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:53.270 
the wetter is the longer it will take to
dry

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.840 

when<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.000> put<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.240> on<00:02:54.740> try<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.950> make<00:02:56.250> sure<00:02:56.280> the

body it goes from the top to the bottom
of<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.370> cup

of the cup

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.530 
of the cup
make<00:03:12.540> sure<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.080> filled<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.100> gaps

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
doesn't matter if you have to rip off a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.350 
doesn't matter if you have to rip off a
little<00:03:21.300> bit<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.630> put<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.830> up<00:03:22.980> again

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
little bit and put it on but up again

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.250 
little bit and put it on but up again
when<00:03:24.360> you're<00:03:24.480> doing<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> rim

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
when you're doing the rim

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.460 
when you're doing the rim
instead<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.130> going<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.970> way<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:28.260> need<00:03:28.440> to

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
instead of going that way you need to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:39.490 
instead of going that way you need to
put<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.190> thing<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.610> way

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.050 

and<00:03:40.220> go<00:03:40.400> all<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> way<00:03:40.910> around<00:03:41.270> once<00:03:42.140> or<00:03:42.320> twice

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
it now we have put three layers around

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.320 
it now we have put three layers around
the<00:03:58.850> top<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.390> around<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.650> bottom<00:04:01.120> one<00:04:02.120> way

around the body all we have to do now is

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.370 
around the body all we have to do now is
wait<00:04:05.600> for<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.930> dry

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380
