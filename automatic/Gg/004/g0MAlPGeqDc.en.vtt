00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
she could get a relationship with
Colleen<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.390> getting<00:01:33.630> point<00:01:33.840> maybe<00:01:33.990> she

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
Colleen as I'm getting point maybe she

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
Colleen as I'm getting point maybe she
might<00:01:34.439> even<00:01:34.530> consider<00:01:34.950> her<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.280> mom<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.880> well

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
might even consider her a mom as well

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
might even consider her a mom as well
but<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.840> won't<00:01:37.079> negate<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> fact<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.950> what

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
but that won't negate the fact of what

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.920 
but that won't negate the fact of what
Sakura<00:01:38.460> Haruno<00:01:38.670> has<00:01:39.119> done<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.659> her

had a lot of twists and turns we've seen
one<00:01:50.070> panel<00:01:50.460> where<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.640> looked<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.030> maybe

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
one panel where it looked like maybe

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.200 
one panel where it looked like maybe
possibly<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> baby<00:01:52.560> bump<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.070> Sakura<00:01:53.399> we've

possibly a baby bump on Sakura we've
seen<00:01:54.450> another<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:55.049> where<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> DNA<00:01:56.159> was

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
seen another time where the DNA was

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
seen another time where the DNA was
seemingly<00:01:57.090> proven<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.780> cutting<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.560> at

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
seemingly proven to be cutting but at

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.319 
seemingly proven to be cutting but at
the<00:01:59.070> end<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> day<00:01:59.399> okay<00:01:59.549> people<00:02:00.270> were

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the end of the day okay people were

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.580 
the end of the day okay people were
saying<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> could<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> strand<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> hair<00:02:01.409> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
saying it could be a strand of hair that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.679 
saying it could be a strand of hair that
was<00:02:01.890> used<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.939> tell<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> difference

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
was used you can tell the difference

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.880 
was used you can tell the difference
people<00:02:03.899> were<00:02:03.990> saying<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.229> well<00:02:04.560> no<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.860> was

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
people were saying that well no it was

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.289 
people were saying that well no it was
probably<00:02:05.070> Sasuke's<00:02:05.759> hair<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.119> she<00:02:06.149> was

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
probably Sasuke's hair because she was

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.109 
probably Sasuke's hair because she was
obsessed<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.750> him<00:02:06.960> if<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.979> was<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> strand<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
obsessed with him if it was a strand of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
obsessed with him if it was a strand of
Sasuke's<00:02:09.780> hair<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.170> tell<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
Sasuke's hair you can tell the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.320 
Sasuke's hair you can tell the
difference<00:02:10.679> between<00:02:10.739> red

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
difference between red

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.900 
difference between red
and<00:02:11.390> black<00:02:11.570> hair<00:02:11.840> suigetsu<00:02:12.770> he's<00:02:13.580> an<00:02:13.760> idiot

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and black hair suigetsu he's an idiot

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.610 
and black hair suigetsu he's an idiot
but<00:02:14.150> he's<00:02:14.360> not<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.690> freaking<00:02:15.170> retarded

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
but he's not that freaking retarded

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.290 
but he's not that freaking retarded
alright<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.100> think<00:02:16.130> he<00:02:16.520> can<00:02:17.030> tell<00:02:17.210> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
alright I think he can tell the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.820 
alright I think he can tell the
difference<00:02:17.570> between<00:02:17.690> colors<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.410> if<00:02:18.710> he

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
difference between colors so if he

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.440 
difference between colors so if he
pulled<00:02:19.070> out<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> hair<00:02:19.490> whatever<00:02:19.820> he<00:02:20.360> would

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
pulled out a hair whatever he would

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.910 
pulled out a hair whatever he would
immediately<00:02:20.660> know<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.200> think<00:02:21.710> that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
immediately know I think that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.710 
immediately know I think that
potentially<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.550> go<00:02:22.760> with<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> rumor<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.420> it

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
potentially I go with the rumor of it

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.710 
potentially I go with the rumor of it
being<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.560> umbilical<00:02:25.040> cord<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.700> obviously<00:02:26.390> if

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
being the umbilical cord so obviously if

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.020 
being the umbilical cord so obviously if
it's<00:02:27.380> cuttings<00:02:27.920> possession<00:02:28.580> but<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:28.910> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's cuttings possession but it's the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.720 
it's cuttings possession but it's the
umbilical<00:02:29.510> cord<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.780> Zatoichi<00:02:30.620> ha<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.520> it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
umbilical cord of Zatoichi ha then it

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.070 
umbilical cord of Zatoichi ha then it
would<00:02:31.820> obviously<00:02:31.970> say<00:02:32.450> perfect<00:02:32.900> match

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
would obviously say perfect match

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.530 
would obviously say perfect match
because<00:02:33.320> it's<00:02:33.590> wrong<00:02:33.770> freakin<00:02:34.190> DNA<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.270> I

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
because it's wrong freakin DNA so I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.610 
because it's wrong freakin DNA so I
don't<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.080> at<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.500> particular

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
don't think that at this particular

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620 
don't think that at this particular
point<00:02:37.070> we<00:02:37.130> have<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.520> solid<00:02:38.090> match<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.540> be

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
point we have a solid match and to be

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.420 
point we have a solid match and to be
honest<00:02:38.840> with<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.140> I've<00:02:39.350> gone<00:02:39.650> many<00:02:40.070> different

honestly with all the twists and turns
I'm<00:02:52.010> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.520> say<00:02:52.640> right<00:02:53.000> now<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.690> until<00:02:53.990> the

I'm going to say right now up until the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.230 
I'm going to say right now up until the
end<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.410> if<00:02:54.500> I'm<00:02:54.620> proven<00:02:55.040> wrong<00:02:55.220> that's<00:02:55.940> fine

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
end and if I'm proven wrong that's fine

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.180 
end and if I'm proven wrong that's fine
and<00:02:56.600> again<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.110> me<00:02:57.230> being<00:02:57.410> fair<00:02:57.770> this<00:02:58.040> is

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.510 
and again this is me being fair this is
me<00:02:58.370> being<00:02:58.550> unbiased<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.810> think<00:03:00.590> indeed<00:03:01.040> the

me being unbiased I think indeed the
real<00:03:01.730> mother<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.570> Sakura<00:03:02.990> Haruno<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.709> think

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
real mother is Sakura Haruno I think

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.860 
real mother is Sakura Haruno I think
that<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.370> was<00:03:04.520> in<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> umbilical<00:03:05.330> cord<00:03:05.360> I

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
that that was in the umbilical cord I

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.630 
that that was in the umbilical cord I
think<00:03:06.410> at<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.620> end<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.920> day<00:03:07.070> she<00:03:07.310> had<00:03:07.490> it

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
think at the end of the day she had it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.830 
think at the end of the day she had it
because<00:03:07.880> that's<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> closest<00:03:08.540> thing<00:03:08.570> she'll

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
because that's the closest thing she'll

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.410 
because that's the closest thing she'll
ever<00:03:08.959> get<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.290> Sasuke's<00:03:09.770> D<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:11.270> that

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
ever get to Sasuke's D you can see that

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.670 
ever get to Sasuke's D you can see that
they<00:03:11.510> love<00:03:11.690> each<00:03:11.810> other<00:03:11.959> things<00:03:12.500> were

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
they love each other things were

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.890 
they love each other things were
complicated<00:03:12.890> as<00:03:13.430> far<00:03:13.610> as<00:03:13.760> Sasuke<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.390> soccer

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
complicated as far as Sasuke and soccer

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.420 
complicated as far as Sasuke and soccer
their<00:03:15.140> goals<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.530> mean<00:03:15.709> Athena<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.130> he<00:03:16.220> was<00:03:16.340> on

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
their goals I mean Athena that he was on

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.800 
their goals I mean Athena that he was on
a<00:03:16.459> mission<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.030> yeah<00:03:17.150> granted<00:03:17.510> they<00:03:17.570> couldn't

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
a mission so yeah granted they couldn't

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.110 
a mission so yeah granted they couldn't
have<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> normal<00:03:18.019> life<00:03:18.350> together<00:03:18.700> but<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.910> think

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
have a normal life together but I think

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.449 
have a normal life together but I think
that<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.269> was<00:03:20.510> indeed<00:03:20.870> Sakura's<00:03:21.739> daughter<00:03:22.160> I

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
that that was indeed Sakura's daughter I

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.220 
that that was indeed Sakura's daughter I
think<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.910> that's<00:03:23.000> indeed<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.330> mom<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.900> mean

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
think that that's indeed the mom I mean

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.720 
think that that's indeed the mom I mean
we've<00:03:24.350> seen<00:03:24.380> her<00:03:24.620> do<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.860> tion<00:03:25.100> not<00:03:25.310> all<00:03:25.459> just

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
we've seen her do the tion not all just

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.070 
we've seen her do the tion not all just
like<00:03:25.880> her<00:03:26.030> with<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.209> punch<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.630> everything<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
like her with a punch and everything the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.750 
like her with a punch and everything the
jutsu<00:03:27.440> just<00:03:27.680> like<00:03:27.800> her<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.430> course<00:03:28.459> that's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
jutsu just like her and of course that's

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.300 
jutsu just like her and of course that's
not<00:03:28.940> 100%<00:03:29.330> confirmation<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:30.290> think<00:03:30.769> just<00:03:31.160> those

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
not 100% confirmation I think just those

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.100 
not 100% confirmation I think just those
are<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.550> glasses<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:32.120> possible<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.690> Katya

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
are the glasses it's possible that Katya

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.560 
are the glasses it's possible that Katya
is<00:03:33.290> already<00:03:33.590> dead<00:03:33.950> again<00:03:34.700> yeah<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.330> we<00:03:35.420> guess

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
is already dead again yeah so we guess

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.880 
is already dead again yeah so we guess
who<00:03:35.690> had<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> little<00:03:36.080> flashback<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.590> her<00:03:36.680> being

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
who had a little flashback of her being

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.740 
who had a little flashback of her being
the<00:03:37.070> officer<00:03:37.489> what<00:03:37.640> not<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.269> again<00:03:38.600> that

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
the officer what not but again that

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.030 
the officer what not but again that
doesn't<00:03:38.780> give<00:03:39.110> any<00:03:39.260> validity<00:03:39.800> or

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
doesn't give any validity or

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.770 
doesn't give any validity or
confirmation<00:03:40.489> one<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:40.910> mean<00:03:41.150> there's<00:03:41.330> nothing

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
confirmation one I mean there's nothing

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.120 
confirmation one I mean there's nothing
really<00:03:41.959> confirming<00:03:42.440> anything<00:03:42.920> at<00:03:43.010> this

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
really confirming anything at this

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.860 
really confirming anything at this
particular<00:03:43.280> point<00:03:43.670> we've<00:03:43.850> had<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.209> troll

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
particular point we've had just troll

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.080 
particular point we've had just troll
here<00:03:45.230> troll<00:03:45.590> there<00:03:45.830> but<00:03:46.070> based<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:46.880> everything

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
here troll there but based on everything

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.910 
here troll there but based on everything
I<00:03:47.300> think<00:03:47.360> that's<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:47.750> key<00:03:48.140> she<00:03:48.320> modeled<00:03:48.620> way<00:03:48.739> of

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
I think that's a key she modeled way of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.440 
I think that's a key she modeled way of
like<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.370> know<00:03:49.489> throwing<00:03:49.790> us<00:03:50.000> off<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:50.390> you

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.440 
it's 100 then confirmed we have the DNA
but<00:03:57.830> it's<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.130> trick<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.640> trap<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.239> at<00:03:59.330> the

maybe<00:04:13.670> he<00:04:13.850> doesn't<00:04:14.090> know<00:04:14.330> about<00:04:14.450> how<00:04:14.900> she<00:04:14.959> was

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
maybe he doesn't know about how she was

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.320 
maybe he doesn't know about how she was
born<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.860> whatnot<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.370> he<00:04:16.850> couldn't<00:04:17.120> really

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
born and whatnot so he couldn't really

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.729 
born and whatnot so he couldn't really
comment<00:04:17.720> on<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:17.989> or<00:04:18.109> whatever<00:04:18.229> maybe<00:04:18.560> he

comment on it or whatever maybe he

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.140 
comment on it or whatever maybe he
didn't<00:04:19.010> want<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.250> maybe<00:04:19.459> he<00:04:19.549> felt<00:04:19.820> she<00:04:20.120> should

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
didn't want to maybe he felt she should
