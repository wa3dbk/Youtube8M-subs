this<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> water-soluble<00:01:05.390> paste<00:01:06.390> flux<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
this is the water-soluble paste flux it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.580 
this is the water-soluble paste flux it
is<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.310> electronics<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.200> bought<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is not for electronics I bought this in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.760 
is not for electronics I bought this in
a<00:01:10.680> kit<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.600> local<00:01:13.110> hardware<00:01:13.350> store<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
a kit from a local hardware store it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
a kit from a local hardware store it
comes<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> flux<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> brush<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> the

this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
this is more than you need so if you

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
this is more than you need so if you
want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> save<00:01:24.360> money<00:01:24.509> by<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.290> space<00:01:25.590> flux<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
want to save money by the space flux and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
want to save money by the space flux and
then<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> smaller<00:01:26.909> tube<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
then get the smaller tube this is a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.130 
then get the smaller tube this is a
large<00:01:28.740> spool<00:01:29.159> it'll<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.820> me<00:01:30.030> fine<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.990> can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
large spool it'll do me fine but you can

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350

go to the store and buy a small spool of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.860 
go to the store and buy a small spool of
it<00:01:33.450> instead

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.950 

you'll<00:01:39.870> need<00:01:40.020> wire<00:01:40.530> cutters<00:01:41.960> needlenose

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you'll need wire cutters needlenose

a quarter of an inch of the wire
sticking<00:03:05.130> out<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:06.540> don't<00:03:06.660> want<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:06.989> hidden

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
sticking out you don't want it hidden

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
sticking out you don't want it hidden
because<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:09.570> too<00:03:09.810> loose<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.380> don't<00:03:11.280> want

all<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.579> way<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.820> because<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.150> might<00:03:12.299> hit<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
all the way in because it might hit the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.190 
all the way in because it might hit the
control<00:03:12.840> arm<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.320> about<00:03:14.100> right<00:03:14.160> there<00:03:15.200> okay

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200

to the top and the bottom I'm going to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.190 
to the top and the bottom I'm going to
get<00:03:29.940> enough<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.420> there<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:30.930> when<00:03:31.170> I

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
get enough in there so that when I

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.009 
get enough in there so that when I
reinstall<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.010> connector<00:03:32.549> I'll<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:33.120> flux

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
reinstall the connector I'll have flux

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.819

on<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.320> as<00:03:34.440> well

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
on it as well

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.680 
on it as well
and<00:03:36.049> I'm<00:03:37.049> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.230> take<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.620> quick<00:03:37.920> link<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and I'm going to take the quick link and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.560 
and I'm going to take the quick link and
slip<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.560> wire<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.010> give<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.060> spin

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
slip it on the wire and give it a spin

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.229 
slip it on the wire and give it a spin
I'm<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.980> realign<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
I'm going to realign it back with the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.229 
I'm going to realign it back with the
black<00:03:45.450> line<00:03:45.799> so<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.829> can<00:03:47.070> see<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.609> seam<00:03:47.880> and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
black line so I can see the seam and

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.150 
black line so I can see the seam and
then<00:03:48.810> when<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.959> apply<00:03:49.260> solder<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.799> can<00:03:50.040> see<00:03:50.280> flow

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
then when I apply solder I can see flow

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.670 
then when I apply solder I can see flow
and<00:03:51.250> coming<00:03:52.000> up<00:03:52.090> through<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.960> connector<00:03:53.380> all

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
and coming up through the connector all

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.750 
and coming up through the connector all
the<00:03:54.040> way<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.400> sides<00:03:56.310> once<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.460> find<00:03:57.670> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
the way to the sides once you find the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.360 
the way to the sides once you find the
seam<00:03:58.200> line<00:03:59.200> up<00:03:59.410> with<00:03:59.530> your<00:03:59.650> black<00:03:59.800> line<00:04:00.070> and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
seam line up with your black line and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.900 
seam line up with your black line and
now<00:04:00.700> we're<00:04:00.850> going<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.060> start<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.630> torch<00:04:02.910> have

important to heat the metal not the
solder<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:09.310> heat<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.580> until<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.360> flux<00:04:10.660> starts

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
solder you heat it until the flux starts

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.140 
solder you heat it until the flux starts
to<00:04:11.110> bubble<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.400> don't<00:04:12.580> need<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.730> lot<00:04:12.940> and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
to bubble and you don't need a lot and

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.090 
to bubble and you don't need a lot and
once<00:04:13.300> you've<00:04:13.420> done<00:04:13.540> this<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:14.080> gently<00:04:14.650> apply

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
once you've done this just gently apply

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.680 
once you've done this just gently apply
the<00:04:15.160> solder<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:15.640> let<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.000> flow<00:04:16.299> into<00:04:16.600> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
the solder and let it flow into the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.600 
the solder and let it flow into the
scene<00:04:16.900> you'll<00:04:17.140> see<00:04:17.290> it<00:04:17.380> flow<00:04:17.860> right<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.430> there

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
scene you'll see it flow right in there

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.070 
scene you'll see it flow right in there
really<00:04:18.820> quick<00:04:19.120> remove<00:04:20.110> the<00:04:20.260> heat<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:21.480> then<00:04:22.480> do

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
really quick remove the heat and then do

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.780 
really quick remove the heat and then do
not<00:04:23.290> touch<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.920> joint<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.520> very

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
not touch the joint this is very

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.550 
not touch the joint this is very
important<00:04:25.300> because<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.230> not<00:04:26.350> want<00:04:26.500> to

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
important because you do not want to

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.650 
important because you do not want to
blow<00:04:26.680> on<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:26.980> or<00:04:27.220> apply<00:04:27.490> anything<00:04:27.820> cold<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.510> it

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
blow on it or apply anything cold to it

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.020 
blow on it or apply anything cold to it
that<00:04:29.140> could<00:04:29.290> actually<00:04:29.710> hinder<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.490> joint<00:04:30.760> and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
that could actually hinder the joint and

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.810 
that could actually hinder the joint and
make<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.690> solder<00:04:31.990> weak<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.830> crystallize<00:04:33.460> so

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
make the solder weak and crystallize so

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.740 
make the solder weak and crystallize so
let<00:04:34.480> it<00:04:34.600> dry<00:04:34.900> on<00:04:34.930> its<00:04:35.290> own<00:04:36.120> after<00:04:37.120> 30<00:04:37.420> seconds

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
let it dry on its own after 30 seconds

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.720 
let it dry on its own after 30 seconds
or<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:37.900> take<00:04:38.770> your<00:04:38.890> towel<00:04:39.100> with<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.430> alcohol

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
or so take your towel with the alcohol

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.660 
or so take your towel with the alcohol
and<00:04:40.060> wipe<00:04:40.240> off<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.720> excess<00:04:41.020> flux<00:04:41.290> paste<00:04:41.670> tug

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
and wipe off the excess flux paste tug

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.610 
and wipe off the excess flux paste tug

if this image is in focus you should see

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.380 
if this image is in focus you should see

anywhere it may take you a few test runs
but<00:04:59.950> you'll<00:05:00.130> get<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.310> hang<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.610> very

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
but you'll get the hang of it very

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.090 
but you'll get the hang of it very
quickly<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.480> I<00:05:01.720> dare<00:05:02.380> say<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.860> lot<00:05:02.980> of

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
quickly and I dare say this is a lot of

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.880 
quickly and I dare say this is a lot of
fun<00:05:03.250> too<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.750> thank<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.290> for<00:05:05.380> watching<00:05:05.590> this
