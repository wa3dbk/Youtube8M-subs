my two holes down through here and then

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.509 
my two holes down through here and then
when<00:02:26.629> I<00:02:26.689> build<00:02:26.930> my<00:02:26.989> brace<00:02:27.319> I'll<00:02:27.620> build<00:02:28.159> it<00:02:28.370> to

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
when I build my brace I'll build it to

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.520 
when I build my brace I'll build it to
fit<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.000> right<00:02:29.269> there<00:02:29.599> when<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.049> pulled<00:02:30.319> this

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
fit that right there when I pulled this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.550 
fit that right there when I pulled this
into<00:02:30.829> place<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.430> pulled<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.689> right<00:02:33.379> into

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
into place it pulled this right into

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.759 
into place it pulled this right into
place<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.159> that<00:02:34.189> here<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:34.819> see<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.450> old

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
place so that here you can see the old

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.259 
place so that here you can see the old
bolt<00:02:36.769> hole<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:37.219> the<00:02:37.280> backside<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.090> one's

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
bolt hole for the backside this one's

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.459 
bolt hole for the backside this one's
rusted<00:02:38.719> away<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.049> it'll<00:02:39.200> need<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.379> be

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
rusted away and it'll need to be

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.559 
rusted away and it'll need to be
replaced<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:40.969> I'm<00:02:41.090> trying<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.359> do<00:02:41.510> is

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
replaced but what I'm trying to do is

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.780 
replaced but what I'm trying to do is
just<00:02:41.719> get<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:42.019> back<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:42.530> same<00:02:42.799> spot<00:02:43.159> and<00:02:43.670> I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
just get it back to the same spot and I

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.240 
just get it back to the same spot and I
figured<00:02:44.180> by<00:02:44.329> doing<00:02:45.290> what<00:02:45.439> I<00:02:45.469> did<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.099> see

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
figured by doing what I did you can see

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.890 
figured by doing what I did you can see
that<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:46.670> side<00:02:46.909> down<00:02:47.120> over<00:02:47.150> there<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> had<00:02:47.780> to

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
that this side down over there I had to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.740 
that this side down over there I had to
use<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.230> long<00:02:48.530> old<00:02:48.799> bolts<00:02:49.329> because<00:02:50.329> what<00:02:50.659> I'm

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
use the long old bolts because what I'm

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.179 
use the long old bolts because what I'm
doing<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:51.109> I'm<00:02:51.260> kind<00:02:51.469> of<00:02:51.590> pulling<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.010> new

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
doing is I'm kind of pulling the new

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.699 
doing is I'm kind of pulling the new
floor<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.879> everything<00:02:53.269> into<00:02:53.810> place<00:02:54.049> with

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
floor and everything into place with

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.879 
floor and everything into place with
itself<00:02:55.159> which<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.359> pretty<00:02:56.689> good<00:02:56.900> work<00:02:57.169> you<00:02:57.709> see

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
itself which is pretty good work you see

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.949 
itself which is pretty good work you see
how<00:02:58.040> nice<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.730> snug<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.239> this<00:02:59.419> fits<00:02:59.720> back

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
how nice and snug all this fits back

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:00.850 
how nice and snug all this fits back
here<00:03:00.230> now

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
here now

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.520 
here now
pretty<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.450> trim<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.480> out<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.080> we'll<00:03:03.290> get

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
pretty to trim that out and we'll get

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.610 
pretty to trim that out and we'll get
back<00:03:03.710> together<00:03:03.890> kind<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.670> turning<00:03:05.030> all<00:03:05.240> these

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
back together kind of turning all these

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.620 
back together kind of turning all these
various<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.830> sundry<00:03:07.190> pieces<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.820> parts<00:03:08.030> into

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
various and sundry pieces and parts into

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.450 
various and sundry pieces and parts into
one<00:03:09.530> piece<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:11.180> bark<00:03:11.660> which<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.460> obviously

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
one piece and bark which is obviously

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.000 
one piece and bark which is obviously
going<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.880> big<00:03:14.090> improvement<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.990> I<00:03:15.260> think

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
going to be a big improvement so I think

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.030 
going to be a big improvement so I think
it's<00:03:16.480> kept<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.750> lot<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.350> day<00:03:18.500> getting<00:03:18.920> that

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
it's kept a lot of the day getting that

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.590

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.120 
done and I think I'm gonna probably have
to<00:03:20.690> knock<00:03:20.930> off<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.470> then<00:03:21.560> come<00:03:21.770> back<00:03:21.800> for

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
to knock off and then come back for

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.370 
to knock off and then come back for
another<00:03:22.190> day<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:22.820> from<00:03:23.480> here<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.780> should<00:03:24.230> be

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
another day but from here I should be

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.920 
another day but from here I should be
able<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.710> go<00:03:24.830> right<00:03:24.980> ahead<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.690> burn<00:03:26.690> me<00:03:26.900> a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
able to go right ahead and burn me a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.390 
able to go right ahead and burn me a
couple<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.320> holes<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.860> go<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.130> underneath

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
couple of holes and go up underneath

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.860 
couple of holes and go up underneath
there<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.850> make<00:03:28.970> my<00:03:29.120> phrase<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.570> think<00:03:29.780> I'm

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
there and make my phrase and I think I'm

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.360 
there and make my phrase and I think I'm
going<00:03:29.990> to<00:03:30.020> make<00:03:30.200> my<00:03:30.380> hole<00:03:30.560> brace<00:03:30.860> here<00:03:31.250> and

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
going to make my hole brace here and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.699 
going to make my hole brace here and
then<00:03:31.459> take<00:03:31.670> all<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.090> out<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.959> then<00:03:33.470> come

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
then take all this out and then come

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.880 
then take all this out and then come
back<00:03:33.740> here<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.430> make<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:35.300> park<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:36.410> has<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.740> be

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
back here and make the park it has to be

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.120 
back here and make the park it has to be
made<00:03:37.130> back<00:03:37.400> here

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
made back here

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.190 
made back here
so<00:03:39.760> it's<00:03:39.940> kind<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.209> kind<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.870> happening<00:03:41.140> a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
so it's kind of kind of happening a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
so it's kind of kind of happening a
little<00:03:41.349> second<00:03:41.890> but<00:03:42.130> this<00:03:42.220> happening<00:03:42.670> so

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
little second but this happening so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.449 
little second but this happening so
that's<00:03:43.900> all<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.200> matters<00:03:44.560> it'll<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.400> done

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
that's all that matters it'll get done

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.300 
that's all that matters it'll get done
eventually
