there's a thread guide on this needle
arm<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.890> isn't<00:02:39.340> depicted<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.270> line

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
arm that isn't depicted in the line

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.590 
arm that isn't depicted in the line
drawing<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.130> also<00:02:42.580> very<00:02:42.910> important

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
drawing this is also very important

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.710 
drawing this is also very important
because<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.349> guides<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.830> thread<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
because it guides the thread to the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.690 
because it guides the thread to the
tension<00:02:47.050> control<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.920> thread<00:02:48.190> goes<00:02:48.459> through

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
tension control the thread goes through

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.910 
tension control the thread goes through
the<00:02:48.819> tension<00:02:49.090> control<00:02:49.780> there's<00:02:50.500> another

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the tension control there's another

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.850 
the tension control there's another
guide<00:02:51.450> underneath<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.840> needle<00:02:53.200> arm<00:02:53.380> that

after you slide in the batteries you'll

after you slide in the batteries you'll
