00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
we're just looking forward to the first

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.640 
we're just looking forward to the first
game<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:28.989> know<00:00:29.079> we<00:00:29.230> kind<00:00:29.409> of<00:00:29.470> had<00:00:29.619> a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
game you know we kind of had a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.979 
game you know we kind of had a
lackluster<00:00:30.460> game<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.939> our<00:00:31.509> final<00:00:31.659> against

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
lackluster game and our final against

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.959 
lackluster game and our final against
Toronto<00:00:32.380> I<00:00:32.410> think<00:00:32.739> everyone<00:00:33.579> on<00:00:33.699> the<00:00:33.789> team

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
Toronto I think everyone on the team

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.729 
Toronto I think everyone on the team
will<00:00:34.120> omit<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.300> was<00:00:34.539> probably<00:00:34.750> are<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.620> know

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
will omit that was probably are you know

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.740 
will omit that was probably are you know
the<00:00:36.460> one<00:00:36.609> game<00:00:36.820> but<00:00:37.000> it's<00:00:37.180> been<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.359> long<00:00:37.570> trip

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
the one game but it's been a long trip

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.959 
the one game but it's been a long trip
and<00:00:38.079> I<00:00:38.109> think<00:00:38.320> because<00:00:39.129> of<00:00:39.309> that<00:00:39.519> we're<00:00:39.910> not

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
and I think because of that we're not

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.340 
and I think because of that we're not
going<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.180> come<00:00:40.300> in<00:00:40.480> over<00:00:40.690> confident<00:00:41.140> against

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
going to come in over confident against

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.750 
going to come in over confident against
Montreal<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.010> that's<00:00:42.190> gonna<00:00:42.309> help<00:00:42.489> us<00:00:42.609> out

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
Montreal and that's gonna help us out

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.490 
Montreal and that's gonna help us out
because<00:00:43.000> we're<00:00:43.570> going<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.750> be<00:00:43.840> fine<00:00:44.050> overall

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
because we're going to be fine overall

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.200 
because we're going to be fine overall
it<00:00:44.590> was<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.829> was<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.039> very<00:00:45.550> positive<00:00:45.760> couple

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
it was it was a very positive couple

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.790 
it was it was a very positive couple
weeks<00:00:46.359> down<00:00:46.510> in<00:00:46.629> Florida<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.649> think<00:00:48.340> game<00:00:48.550> wise

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
weeks down in Florida I think game wise

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.840 
weeks down in Florida I think game wise
we<00:00:50.800> showed<00:00:51.039> that<00:00:51.070> we<00:00:51.280> have<00:00:51.429> a<00:00:51.460> strength<00:00:51.760> of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
we showed that we have a strength of

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.590 
we showed that we have a strength of
squad<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.300> now<00:00:52.800> hopefully<00:00:53.800> we<00:00:53.920> can<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:55.539> a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
squad and now hopefully we can make a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.209 
squad and now hopefully we can make a
hard<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.199> manager<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.559> pick<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.800> 11<00:00:57.100> that

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
hard to the manager to pick the 11 that

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.880 
hard to the manager to pick the 11 that
goes<00:00:57.699> in<00:00:57.820> for<00:00:58.329> Saturday<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:58.899> that's<00:00:59.710> what<00:00:59.800> we

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
goes in for Saturday and that's what we

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.560 
goes in for Saturday and that's what we
want<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:00.429> can<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.699> week<00:01:00.850> out<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.390> think

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
want we can in week out and I think

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.439 
want we can in week out and I think
preseason<00:01:01.929> was<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.140> good<00:01:02.320> chance<00:01:02.469> to<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:04.269> show

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
preseason was a good chance to to show

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.850 
preseason was a good chance to to show
the<00:01:04.629> type<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:04.839> talent<00:01:05.049> we<00:01:05.259> have<00:01:05.290> but<00:01:05.590> now<00:01:05.710> it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the type of talent we have but now it's

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.710 
the type of talent we have but now it's
about<00:01:05.920> transferring<00:01:06.850> all<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.150> energy<00:01:07.450> we<00:01:07.479> put

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
about transferring all the energy we put

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.090 
about transferring all the energy we put
into<00:01:07.869> preseason<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.560> make<00:01:08.680> sure<00:01:08.799> we<00:01:08.920> get<00:01:09.040> it

just reinforcing those over the next few
days<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.650> continuing<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.710> make<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.100> better

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
days and continuing to make it better

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.800 
days and continuing to make it better
and<00:02:04.580> build<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.909> confidence<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.720> know

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
we've been able to gain from preseason

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.430 
we've been able to gain from preseason
games<00:02:08.030> there's<00:02:08.509> lots<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.780> positives<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> take

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
games there's lots of positives to take

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.680 
games there's lots of positives to take
away<00:02:09.649> from<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.100> couple<00:02:10.280> weeks<00:02:10.630> keeping<00:02:11.630> a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
away from the couple weeks keeping a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.570 
away from the couple weeks keeping a
clean<00:02:11.840> sheet<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> team<00:02:12.530> for<00:02:12.980> every<00:02:13.220> game<00:02:13.400> i

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
clean sheet as a team for every game i

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100 
clean sheet as a team for every game i
think<00:02:13.610> was<00:02:13.880> was<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> most<00:02:14.690> important

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
think was was the most important

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.620 
think was was the most important
positive<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:16.910> score<00:02:17.120> goals<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.600> i

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
positive and then we score goals so i

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.030 
positive and then we score goals so i
think<00:02:18.050> if<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.320> can<00:02:18.560> continue<00:02:18.920> that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
think if we can continue that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.620 
think if we can continue that
combination<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.850> rest<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> season<00:02:20.360> a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
combination for the rest of the season a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.690 
combination for the rest of the season a
novia<00:02:20.959> will<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.770> good<00:02:21.800> hands<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.340> think

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
novia will be in good hands I think

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.640 
novia will be in good hands I think
hopefully<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.780> maturity<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:24.440> team

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
hopefully it's a maturity of this team

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.140 
hopefully it's a maturity of this team
from<00:02:24.830> last<00:02:24.890> year<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.760> going<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.000> get<00:02:26.090> us

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
from last year that's going to get us

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.750 
from last year that's going to get us
through<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.890> know<00:02:28.010> knowing<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.430> not<00:02:28.610> all

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
through you know knowing that not all

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.979 
through you know knowing that not all
the<00:02:28.850> breaks<00:02:29.030> are<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.360> go<00:02:29.450> our<00:02:29.630> way<00:02:29.780> and

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the breaks are going to go our way and

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.270 
the breaks are going to go our way and
how<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.230> deal<00:02:30.500> with<00:02:30.620> them<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:30.980> that's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
how we deal with them and I think that's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.280 
how we deal with them and I think that's
going<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.459> be<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> important<00:02:32.120> part<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.170> this

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
going to be the important part of this

if there are friendly games you start to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.940 
if there are friendly games you start to
