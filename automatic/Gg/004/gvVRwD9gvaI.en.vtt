00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
on Saturday I used it today for the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.490 
on Saturday I used it today for the
first<00:00:16.529> time<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.300> used<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.390> because<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
first time I used it because I have to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.950 
first time I used it because I have to
practice<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.010> own<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> do

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
practice on my own and when I have to do

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380 
practice on my own and when I have to do
long<00:00:22.560> sets<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.430> hard<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.730> me<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> focus

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
long sets it's very hard for me to focus

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.800 
long sets it's very hard for me to focus
and<00:00:24.900> also<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:26.340> through<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> sets<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
and also to go through the sets so I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
and also to go through the sets so I
thought<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.410> music<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:29.010> help<00:00:29.220> me<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:30.000> this

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
thought the music will help me do this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
first I start with some specifications

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.920 
first I start with some specifications
the<00:00:46.230> capacity<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.309> Neptune<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.969> 4

gigabyte<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.059> space<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
gigabyte so you got space for

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.779 
gigabyte so you got space for
approximately<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> thousand<00:00:53.160> songs<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:55.789> yeah

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
approximately a thousand songs or yeah

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
um the screen is the oil ad screen you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
um the screen is the oil ad screen you
actually<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.020> use<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
actually don't use it because it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
actually don't use it because it's
sitting<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> back<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.420> head<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.960> it's

sitting on the back of your head so it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.210 
sitting on the back of your head so it's
a<00:01:04.320> nice<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> happen<00:01:06.200> actually

a nice thing to happen actually

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
a nice thing to happen actually
unnecessary<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> drag-and-drop

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
unnecessary it has a drag-and-drop

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.520 
unnecessary it has a drag-and-drop
function<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.820> very<00:01:12.540> nice<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
function which is very very nice you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
function which is very very nice you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
don't have to convert a lot or something

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
don't have to convert a lot or something
you<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.540> take<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> files<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.100> AAC

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you just take the files you can use AAC

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.800 
you just take the files you can use AAC
mp3<00:01:18.119> or<00:01:18.540> WMA<00:01:18.960> files<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.180> you<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.360> take<00:01:21.600> them

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
mp3 or WMA files and you just take them

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.080 
mp3 or WMA files and you just take them
and<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.770> drop<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.400> mp3<00:01:23.880> player

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and just drop them on the mp3 player

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.399 
and just drop them on the mp3 player
player<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.049> work<00:01:25.580> um<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:28.049> battery

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
player and they work um the battery

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.910 
player and they work um the battery
lasts<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.070> approximately<00:01:29.220> 8<00:01:29.850> hours<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.920> think

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lasts for approximately 8 hours I think

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
lasts for approximately 8 hours I think

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that's correct I haven't tested it yet

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.649 
that's correct I haven't tested it yet
