00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
but you know it's up it's on a whole

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.070 
but you know it's up it's on a whole
different<00:03:43.459> level<00:03:43.820> now<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.360> division<00:03:44.959> one

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
different level now on division one

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.170 
different level now on division one
level<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:45.590> i<00:03:45.830> want<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.700> i<00:03:46.760> want<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.060> focus

on<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.630> movement<00:03:48.019> in<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.140> pocket<00:03:48.500> i<00:03:48.709> think

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
on that movement in the pocket i think

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.830 
on that movement in the pocket i think
one<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.730> things<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.000> i<00:03:50.090> do<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.390> best<00:03:50.630> is

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
one of the things that i do the best is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.050 
one of the things that i do the best is
just<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:52.489> know<00:03:52.580> there's<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.820> lot<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:52.940> people

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
just you know there's a lot of people

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.759 
just you know there's a lot of people
look<00:03:53.269> real<00:03:53.540> good<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.720> paper<00:03:53.930> or<00:03:54.320> they<00:03:54.440> or<00:03:54.650> they

because you know he can he comes out any
trains<00:04:33.800> real<00:04:33.979> hard<00:04:34.159> people<00:04:34.340> see<00:04:34.580> what<00:04:34.699> he's

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
trains real hard people see what he's

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.209 
trains real hard people see what he's
doing<00:04:34.999> here<00:04:35.180> but<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.870> know<00:04:35.960> he's<00:04:36.499> a<00:04:36.529> really

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
doing here but you know he's a really

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.350 
doing here but you know he's a really
really<00:04:37.249> good<00:04:37.550> player<00:04:37.789> when<00:04:37.969> he<00:04:37.999> gets<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.300> the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
really good player when he gets on the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.519 
really good player when he gets on the

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
fields I think it's just like an

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.769 
fields I think it's just like an
attitude<00:04:40.069> that<00:04:40.279> you<00:04:41.029> have<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.419> have<00:04:41.539> online

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:41.779 
attitude that you have to have online

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.689 
attitude that you have to have online
set<00:04:42.259> and<00:04:42.469> really<00:04:42.800> what<00:04:43.039> people<00:04:43.279> don't<00:04:43.430> allow

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
set and really what people don't allow

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.999 
set and really what people don't allow
people<00:04:43.819> to<00:04:43.999> understand<00:04:44.419> is<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:45.620> know<00:04:45.740> not<00:04:45.770> if

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
people to understand is you know not if

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.709 
people to understand is you know not if
it<00:04:46.099> happens<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:46.550> Saturday<00:04:47.029> no<00:04:47.300> one's<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:47.599> winner

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:47.719
