00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.330 
that's my first impression so it tingles
a<00:03:46.689> lot<00:03:46.870> more<00:03:47.049> now<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.260> think<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.739> can<00:03:47.920> see<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.280> a

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
a lot more now I think I can see it a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.160 
a lot more now I think I can see it a
little<00:03:48.459> bit<00:03:48.670> more<00:03:48.849> like<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.750> definitely<00:03:49.930> a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
little bit more like it's definitely a

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.080 
little bit more like it's definitely a
little<00:03:50.290> bit<00:03:50.470> like<00:03:50.620> swollen<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.489> hope<00:03:51.760> I'm<00:03:51.939> not

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
little bit like swollen I hope I'm not

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.399 
little bit like swollen I hope I'm not
gonna<00:03:52.450> bruise<00:03:52.959> from<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:54.459> yeah<00:03:55.329> so<00:03:55.930> it

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
gonna bruise from this but yeah so it

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.710 
gonna bruise from this but yeah so it
did<00:03:56.890> they<00:03:57.159> I<00:03:57.340> think<00:03:57.730> make<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.239> little<00:03:58.540> bit<00:03:58.659> of

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
did they I think make a little bit of

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.599 
did they I think make a little bit of
difference<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.439> definitely<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.069> as<00:04:00.129> Extreme

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
difference but definitely not as Extreme

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.780 
difference but definitely not as Extreme
as<00:04:00.700> other<00:04:00.879> people<00:04:04.799> well<00:04:05.799> you<00:04:06.220> look<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.549> little

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
as other people well you look a little

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.879 
as other people well you look a little
bit<00:04:07.000> more<00:04:07.180> plump<00:04:07.480> but<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.319> could<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.530> be<00:04:08.680> me

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
bit more plump but that could just be me

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.229 
bit more plump but that could just be me
you<00:04:09.129> let<00:04:09.310> me<00:04:09.430> know<00:04:09.459> what<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.819> think<00:04:10.000> it's

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
you let me know what you think it's

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.849 
you let me know what you think it's
definitely<00:04:10.389> going<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.780> wear<00:04:10.959> off<00:04:11.139> obviously

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
definitely going to wear off obviously

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.589 
definitely going to wear off obviously
because<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.400> have<00:04:12.579> to<00:04:12.700> redo<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.389> some

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
because you have to redo it so some

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.119
