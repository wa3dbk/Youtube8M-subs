originally<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.010> season<00:01:41.370> one<00:01:41.550> where<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.910> gets<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
originally in season one where it gets a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
originally in season one where it gets a
thousand<00:01:42.510> attack<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.960> every<00:01:43.110> card<00:01:43.260> in<00:01:43.350> your

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
thousand attack for every card in your

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.130 
thousand attack for every card in your
hand<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:44.310> put<00:01:44.520> gets<00:01:44.700> 100<00:01:45.090> attack<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.810> 100

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
hand and this put gets 100 attack in 100

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.720 
hand and this put gets 100 attack in 100
defense<00:01:46.440> for<00:01:46.800> every<00:01:47.070> part<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.370> hand<00:01:47.580> and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
defense for every part in your hand and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.400 
defense for every part in your hand and
you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.180> pay<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> water<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.930> give<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.140> flying

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
you can pay a water to give it flying

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.910 
you can pay a water to give it flying
and<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.610> um<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.540> whole<00:01:51.840> idea<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.530> deck<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and so um the whole idea of the deck is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.040 
and so um the whole idea of the deck is
to<00:01:53.040> constantly<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.570> seven<00:01:54.570> cards<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:54.960> your

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
to constantly have seven cards in your

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.440 
to constantly have seven cards in your
head<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.770> always<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:56.190> 700<00:01:56.700> attack<00:01:56.940> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
head so this is always at 700 attack so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
head so this is always at 700 attack so
it's<00:01:57.570> essentially<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.080> 700<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.770> flying<00:01:59.040> for

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's essentially a 700 with flying for

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.220 
it's essentially a 700 with flying for
the<00:01:59.370> cost<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.790> two<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.720> like<00:02:00.810> Alice

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
the cost of two so that's like Alice

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.870 
the cost of two so that's like Alice
that's<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.710> without<00:02:01.890> having<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that's but without having to have a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.040 
that's but without having to have a
three<00:02:03.540> cost<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:05.250> 3lauras<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.780> Laura

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
three cost and then 3lauras so Laura

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.660 
three cost and then 3lauras so Laura
doesn't<00:02:07.290> draw<00:02:07.620> but<00:02:07.830> because<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.220> replaces

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
doesn't draw but because it replaces

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.070 
doesn't draw but because it replaces
itself<00:02:08.819> when<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.269> summoned<00:02:09.509> either<00:02:09.840> with

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
itself when it's summoned either with

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.740 
itself when it's summoned either with
carmela<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.709> another<00:02:11.039> Laura<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.720> still

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
carmela or another Laura you still

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
carmela or another Laura you still
retain<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.500> same<00:02:13.650> amount<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> cards<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.280> your

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
retain the same amount of cards in your

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.589 
retain the same amount of cards in your
hand<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:14.790> constantly<00:02:15.030> always<00:02:15.390> trying

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
hand so you're constantly always trying

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.129 
hand so you're constantly always trying
to<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.840> seven<00:02:16.769> or<00:02:17.010> six<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.909> ok<00:02:18.000> too<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.810> was

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
to have seven or six is ok too but I was

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.330 
to have seven or six is ok too but I was
trying<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.349> go<00:02:19.469> for<00:02:19.620> seven<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> whole<00:02:20.159> time

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
trying to go for seven the whole time

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.660 
trying to go for seven the whole time
and<00:02:20.579> then<00:02:21.299> three<00:02:21.659> Alice<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.290> kind

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
and then three Alice this is kind

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.550 
and then three Alice this is kind
where<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> other<00:02:23.030> controlling<00:02:23.840> part<00:02:24.230> comes

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
where the other controlling part comes

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.010 
where the other controlling part comes
in<00:02:24.680> because<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.450> make<00:02:26.569> everything<00:02:26.780> on

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
in because I can make everything on

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.500 
in because I can make everything on
targetable<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.860> also<00:02:28.510> manage

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
targetable and I can also manage

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.570 
targetable and I can also manage
something<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.560> need<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.190> get<00:02:31.280> out<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.520> the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
something that I need to get out of the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.949 
something that I need to get out of the
game<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.000> minus<00:02:32.209> off<00:02:32.360> lease<00:02:32.569> or<00:02:32.690> something

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
game like I minus off lease or something

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.780 
game like I minus off lease or something
because<00:02:33.140> there<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.530> no<00:02:33.770> actual<00:02:33.950> like<00:02:34.280> five<00:02:34.550> or

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
because there is no actual like five or

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.630 
because there is no actual like five or
dark<00:02:35.060> hurt<00:02:35.300> too<00:02:35.540> much<00:02:35.660> removal<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.290> decided<00:02:37.069> I

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
dark hurt too much removal I decided I

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
dark hurt too much removal I decided I
would<00:02:37.730> use<00:02:38.030> Alice<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.780> remove<00:02:39.140> alongside

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
would use Alice to remove alongside

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.750 
would use Alice to remove alongside
carmella<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.819> then<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.870> moon<00:02:42.050> shards<00:02:42.760> Mozart

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
carmella and then to moon shards Mozart

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.610 
carmella and then to moon shards Mozart
lets<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.330> draw<00:02:44.540> when<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.020> two<00:02:45.230> counters

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
lets you draw when you have two counters

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.350 
lets you draw when you have two counters
and<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.160> can<00:02:46.280> rest<00:02:46.520> stuff<00:02:46.730> which<00:02:46.970> lets<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.239> go

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
and it can rest stuff which lets you go

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.580 
and it can rest stuff which lets you go
for<00:02:47.569> attacks<00:02:47.810> even<00:02:48.110> though<00:02:48.200> it's<00:02:48.290> not<00:02:48.410> too

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
for attacks even though it's not too

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.199 
for attacks even though it's not too
crucial<00:02:48.800> because<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.340> do<00:02:49.489> have<00:02:49.519> access<00:02:49.940> to

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
crucial because you do have access to

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.960 
crucial because you do have access to
flying<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.630> Julius<00:02:51.019> but<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.920> mainly<00:02:52.580> wanted<00:02:52.849> to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
flying of Julius but I mainly wanted to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.490 
flying of Julius but I mainly wanted to
use<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.420> draw<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.660> tap<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.200> just<00:02:54.410> you

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
use it for the draw the tap is just you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.620 
use it for the draw the tap is just you
know<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:55.250> extra<00:02:55.700> push<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.000> damage<00:02:56.269> if<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.450> don't

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
know for extra push in damage if I don't

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.970 
know for extra push in damage if I don't
have<00:02:56.780> all<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.140> pliers<00:02:57.380> like<00:02:57.590> if<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.830> have

only Julius and then to Carmela for
removal<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.160> said<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.580> don't<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.000> lot

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
you can also use it on Hanzo because

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.759 
you can also use it on Hanzo because
it's<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.090> new<00:03:50.120> enter<00:03:50.540> effect<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.049> applies

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
bounce back into the fuel that counts as

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.030 
bounce back into the fuel that counts as
an<00:03:55.730> enter<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.269> then<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:57.290> get<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.620> draw<00:03:57.799> again

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
an enter and then you get the draw again
