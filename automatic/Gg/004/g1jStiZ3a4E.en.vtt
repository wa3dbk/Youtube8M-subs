a<00:02:17.330> holding<00:02:18.170> form<00:02:18.530> what<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.160> mean<00:02:19.430> by<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.640> is

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
a holding form what I mean by that is

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.420 
a holding form what I mean by that is
the<00:02:20.120> fact<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.900> Houston<00:02:21.200> Rockets<00:02:21.430> one

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
the fact that the Houston Rockets one

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.460 
the fact that the Houston Rockets one
and<00:02:22.730> cover<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.330> spread<00:02:23.510> at<00:02:23.720> home<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.080> also

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
and cover the spread at home and also

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.470 
and cover the spread at home and also
went<00:02:24.680> over<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> total<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.519> that<00:02:25.670> game<00:02:25.910> while

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
went over the total in that game while

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.930 
went over the total in that game while
the<00:02:26.630> Utah<00:02:26.959> Jazz<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.160> cover<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.550> total

when they met at energysolutions arena

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.940 
when they met at energysolutions arena
earlier<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.120> year<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.989> one<00:02:33.200> felt<00:02:33.440> well

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
earlier this year but that one felt well

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.070 
earlier this year but that one felt well
underneath<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.519> total<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.060> yes<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> Rockets

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
underneath the total and yes the Rockets

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.539 
underneath the total and yes the Rockets
we're<00:02:36.290> playing<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.739> 2nd<00:02:37.160> game<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
we're playing the 2nd game of the

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.729 
we're playing the 2nd game of the
back-to-back<00:02:38.060> which<00:02:38.600> is<00:02:38.810> very<00:02:39.080> hard<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.470> do

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
back-to-back which is very hard to do

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.039 
back-to-back which is very hard to do
but<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.340> still<00:02:40.670> think<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.569> number<00:02:41.870> has

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
but I still think that the number has

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.800 
but I still think that the number has
been<00:02:42.080> risen<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.799> level<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.220> we<00:02:43.459> get

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
been risen to a level that we get

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.150 
been risen to a level that we get
considerable<00:02:44.810> value<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:45.500> playing<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
considerable value and playing the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.949 
considerable value and playing the
unders<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.610> my<00:02:46.760> official<00:02:47.269> pick<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:47.780> game

unders so my official pick on this game

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.830 
unders so my official pick on this game
