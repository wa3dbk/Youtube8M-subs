that<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.549> use<00:02:03.770> regularly<00:02:05.060> mixed<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that they use regularly mixed up and

everything else that they do or say I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.369 
everything else that they do or say I
now<00:02:08.879> realize<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.599> believe<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:09.989> it's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
now realize that or believe that it's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.460 
now realize that or believe that it's
for<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> purpose<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.129> training

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
for the purpose of training

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.900 
for the purpose of training
my<00:02:13.220> mind<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.700> my<00:02:13.820> thoughts<00:02:14.320> for<00:02:15.670> being<00:02:16.670> able<00:02:16.760> to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
my mind of my thoughts for being able to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.790 
my mind of my thoughts for being able to
understand<00:02:17.450> them<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> different<00:02:18.380> level<00:02:18.560> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
understand them on a different level so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.650 
understand them on a different level so
blimmin<00:02:19.450> subliminally<00:02:20.450> even<00:02:22.540> when<00:02:23.540> they

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
blimmin subliminally even when they

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.480 
blimmin subliminally even when they
started<00:02:24.080> they<00:02:24.230> were<00:02:24.260> very<00:02:24.500> loud<00:02:24.740> they<00:02:25.430> were

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
started they were very loud they were

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.180 
started they were very loud they were
very<00:02:25.610> very<00:02:25.700> loud<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:27.290> was<00:02:27.800> able<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.010> hear

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
very very loud and I was able to hear

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.750 
very very loud and I was able to hear
them<00:02:28.370> quite<00:02:29.030> clearly<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.740> mean<00:02:30.740> they<00:02:30.860> were<00:02:30.920> they

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
them quite clearly I mean they were they

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.980 
them quite clearly I mean they were they
sounded<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.210> they<00:02:32.300> were<00:02:32.510> coming<00:02:32.540> from

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
sounded like they were coming from

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.920 
sounded like they were coming from
another<00:02:33.770> room<00:02:34.040> or<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.640> behind<00:02:34.850> me<00:02:35.300> or<00:02:35.510> what

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
another room or from behind me or what

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.050 
another room or from behind me or what
have<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.650> time<00:02:37.220> went<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.490> couple<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
have you as time went on couple of

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.750 
have you as time went on couple of
months<00:02:38.270> went<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.600> they've<00:02:39.530> now<00:02:39.740> been<00:02:40.490> reduced

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
months went on they've now been reduced

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.420 
months went on they've now been reduced
as<00:02:41.210> sounding<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.660> they're<00:02:42.110> virtually<00:02:42.980> and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
as sounding like they're virtually and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.890 
as sounding like they're virtually and
they<00:02:43.700> fluctuate<00:02:44.210> it<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.450> sound<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.690> they

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
they fluctuate it to sound like they

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.540 
they fluctuate it to sound like they
were<00:02:44.990> going<00:02:45.260> away<00:02:45.380> where<00:02:45.770> they<00:02:45.890> were<00:02:46.010> almost

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
were going away where they were almost

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.490 
were going away where they were almost
very<00:02:46.970> muted<00:02:47.380> almost<00:02:48.380> but<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.680> still<00:02:49.010> heard<00:02:49.310> them

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
very muted almost but I still heard them

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.840 
very muted almost but I still heard them
there's<00:02:51.500> still<00:02:51.710> something<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.490> in

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
there's still something going on like in

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.710 
there's still something going on like in
my<00:02:53.000> ear<00:02:53.210> when<00:02:54.100> they<00:02:55.100> spoke<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.640> felt<00:02:55.910> vibration

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
my ear when they spoke I felt vibration

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.290 
my ear when they spoke I felt vibration
you<00:02:57.440> know<00:02:57.560> that's<00:02:58.400> how<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.550> would<00:02:58.790> feel<00:02:59.000> like<00:02:59.270> a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
you know that's how I would feel like a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300 
you know that's how I would feel like a
vibration<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.380> certain<00:03:00.650> words<00:03:00.920> or<00:03:01.130> whatever

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
vibration on certain words or whatever

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.050 
vibration on certain words or whatever
it<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:01.880> ear<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:03.320> now<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.280> hear<00:03:04.820> them

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
it is in my ear to now it I hear them

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.120 
it is in my ear to now it I hear them
I'm<00:03:05.240> aware<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.570> them<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.050> don't<00:03:07.010> believe

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
I'm aware of them but I don't believe

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.550 
I'm aware of them but I don't believe
that<00:03:07.280> I'm<00:03:07.490> literally<00:03:07.880> hearing<00:03:08.420> them<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.810> my

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that I'm literally hearing them with my

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.280 
that I'm literally hearing them with my
ear<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:10.130> think<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.270> more<00:03:11.540> internalized

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
ear I think that it's more internalized

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.940 
ear I think that it's more internalized
it's<00:03:12.560> deeper<00:03:12.920> than<00:03:13.070> that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
it's deeper than that

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.620 
it's deeper than that
they're<00:03:15.950> trying<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.310> basically<00:03:16.520> train<00:03:17.150> me<00:03:17.360> I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
they're trying to basically train me I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.720 
they're trying to basically train me I
guess<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.959> can<00:03:18.080> say<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> hear<00:03:18.650> them<00:03:18.830> without

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
guess you can say to hear them without

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.340 
guess you can say to hear them without
hearing<00:03:20.060> them<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.480> be<00:03:20.600> aware<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.900> them<00:03:21.050> without

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
hearing them to be aware of them without

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.020 
hearing them to be aware of them without
actually<00:03:22.040> hearing<00:03:22.190> them<00:03:22.459> that's<00:03:22.670> where<00:03:22.910> we're

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
actually hearing them that's where we're

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.720 
actually hearing them that's where we're
at<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.590> it's<00:03:24.920> frightening<00:03:25.340> I'm<00:03:25.610> not

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
at now and it's frightening I'm not

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.120 
at now and it's frightening I'm not
gonna<00:03:25.880> lie<00:03:26.060> it's<00:03:26.209> scary<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.959> I'm<00:03:27.860> trying<00:03:28.070> to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
gonna lie it's scary but I'm trying to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.810 
gonna lie it's scary but I'm trying to
stay<00:03:28.280> strong

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
stay strong

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.240 
stay strong
I've<00:03:29.150> spoken<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.540> some<00:03:29.780> other<00:03:29.989> people<00:03:30.650> who

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
I've spoken to some other people who

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.100 
I've spoken to some other people who
believe<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.760> be<00:03:31.880> tea<00:03:32.090> eyes<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.720> they

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
believe to be tea eyes and they

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.020 
believe to be tea eyes and they
explained<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.680> me<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.190> yeah<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.700> is

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
explained to me that this yeah this is

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.380 
explained to me that this yeah this is
the<00:03:35.840> case<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:37.040> they<00:03:37.250> basically<00:03:37.670> fluctuate

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
the case that they basically fluctuate

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.630 
the case that they basically fluctuate
and<00:03:38.630> they're<00:03:38.840> gonna<00:03:39.020> try<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.890> basically<00:03:40.370> get

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
and they're gonna try to basically get

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.150 
and they're gonna try to basically get
as<00:03:40.790> deep<00:03:41.060> into<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:42.350> guess<00:03:42.709> my<00:03:42.920> thought

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
as deep into I guess my thought

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.350 
as deep into I guess my thought
processes<00:03:43.760> as<00:03:44.200> possible<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.730> was<00:03:46.730> told<00:03:46.910> by<00:03:47.090> one

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
processes as possible I was told by one

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.810 
processes as possible I was told by one
that<00:03:47.570> it's<00:03:47.690> for<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.900> purpose<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.820> harder

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
that it's for the purpose of harder

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.740 
that it's for the purpose of harder
detection<00:03:50.860> for<00:03:51.860> this<00:03:52.070> because<00:03:52.610> I'm<00:03:53.209> sure<00:03:53.480> that

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
detection for this because I'm sure that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.750 
detection for this because I'm sure that
there<00:03:54.019> has<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.200> be<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.500> way<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> detect<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.580> with

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
there has to be a way to detect it with

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.060 
there has to be a way to detect it with
the<00:03:55.910> right<00:03:56.060> equipment<00:03:56.330> or<00:03:56.600> right<00:03:56.810> tools<00:03:57.110> to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
the right equipment or right tools to

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.770 
the right equipment or right tools to
detect<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.610> but<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.239> more<00:03:59.480> I<00:04:01.239> guess<00:04:02.239> specific

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780
