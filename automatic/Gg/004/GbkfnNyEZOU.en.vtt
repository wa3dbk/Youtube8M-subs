 now 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 people who have pedrosa have a sweat 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 exaggerated and out of control and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 This leads to many problems in life.

 on this screen we have hyperhidrosis 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.600
 your hands more often than not. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.910
 form palmar the feet the plantar form

 armpit of some patience for maxillary 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 also that it has not been demonstrated that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.600
 the craniofacial form by the people who 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.049
 have excessive sweating in the easy and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.049
 on the scalp 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.420
 clinical treatment it is indicated for 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 the patients presenting the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 hyperhidrosis usually mild to 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.549
 moderate intensity 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 is like the first form of treatment 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.939
 of these patients 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.640
 this treatment is actually a treatment 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.720
 temporary or when patients to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.009
 to treat the symptoms 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 return 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.000
 we have three basic types in 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.680
 clinical treatment 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.170
 we have the use of some medications 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 some anticholinergic tablets that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.360
 reduce excessive sweating 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.790
 the anti-perspirant solutions applied 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 in the armpit in the hands of some people 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.920
 some patients and the botulinum toxin 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.090
 famous botox that is used in medicine 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.799
 aesthetics 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.990
 among these clinical treatments 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.710
 time the the toxin botulinum more 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.020
 effective 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.759
 however it lasts only between four 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 and a maximum of six months 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.619
 the patient has to undergo new 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.619
 applications 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.399
 is the treatment that lives the control 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.530
 the treatment of the disease 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.870
 surgical treatment indicated the patients 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.270
 have sweating hyperhidrosis form 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.400
 severe and is damaging the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.840
 quality of life of these people once they 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.370
 surgical treatment looks at the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.709
 definitive control this is the main 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.790
 recommended form of treatment by the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.840
 Brazilian society of surgery 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.459
 thoracic 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.550
 patients who present with discomfort 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:35.920
 for definitive treatment it is 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.700
 performed in a minimally invasive manner 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.040
 through two small incisions 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.950
 notorious that we will show our heads 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.190
 a tie that is precisely the center that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.630
 stimulates excessively and one of the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.140
 Sweat Control 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.650
 There are 12 incisions in fact the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.480
 five millimeters each on each side of the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.130
 for example on the left side of the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.950
 people control for surgery to 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.290
 block the left tie head and 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.290
 control the symptoms of the left half 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.820
 of the body and the right side a lock 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.480
 to control the symptoms half 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.390
 right 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.700
 these photos in the illustrations 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.530
 we can see the places the decisions 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.850
 in men the incidence is not pear there and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.239
 axillary 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.670
 In the woman, the incision is below the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.170
 breast juice right on the spot 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.200
 bra machine 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.170
 the bikini and also the armpit 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.389
 we go to the left and the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.680
 the right side of the same toll decision 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.810
 in half socks 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.989
 therefore the procedure with a little 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.989
 reason 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.940
 the patient is discharged more 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.609
 feels less pain in the 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.799
 postoperative has less bleeding 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.200
 therefore the patient who actually has 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.090
 a result the same results 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.100
 conventional surgery with 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.470
 large circumcisions 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.000
 besides the aesthetic result that is very 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.610
 much more favorable 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.290
 A scar that is very small than 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.530
 when compared with surgeries 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.480
 conventional open and this was the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.430
 Today's health moment we return in a 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.900
 next issue with one more tip for 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.900
 you can live well
