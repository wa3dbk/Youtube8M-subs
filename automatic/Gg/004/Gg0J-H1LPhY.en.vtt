 Hello everyone, you have a channel on windows 8 and 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.280
 the topic of today's video tutorial 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.070
 windows 8 keyboard doesn't work if you 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.389
 faced with such a problem that is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.730
 two main reasons why it is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.169
 there is this software reason and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 back anyway you will need 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.599
 carry out certain actions in order 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.329
 to see what's the reason for your 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 problems and the first thing we recommend 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.130
 do it disconnect your keyboard from 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.490
 your computer connect it to 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.020
 another computer and check to make sure 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.240
 Does it work on another computer? 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.570
 if on another computer the keyboard is not 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:54.630
 it works in this case, most likely 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 problem with the keyboard viz 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.350
 try on multiple computers 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.780
 songs to all computers she 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.670
 no connection is detected and computers 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 I have not seen it is possible that the problem is with 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.189
 the keyboard itself is possibly a problem 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.030
 just with a wire cord which 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.260
 connects keyboard 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.909
 here and accordingly there will need to be 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.600
 either repair the keyboard with love 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.490
 just me 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.390
 if you have a fairies wireless keyboard 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 sense to check the freshness of the batteries can 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.890
 just being batteries are already exhausted 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:34.390
 you need to replace them 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.690
 here note add if you have 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.690
 keyboard 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.920
 built-in laptop is if you have 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.429
 laptop and accordingly you cannot 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.179
 take off 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:50.110
 connect another laptop then in such 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.909
 case we can solve this problem 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.390
 in the following way 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.319
 The first is to reinstall the driver for 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.780
 this we just go to the dispatcher 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:07.420
 devices device manager we find 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.890
 keyboard find your keyboard in 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.190
 In this case, it is integrated 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.170
 keyboard and this keyboard you 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.980
 click on it with the right mouse button and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.730
 click delete and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.790
 restart your computer after 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.800
 computer restart windows 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.170
 will restore necessary for work 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.280
 This keyboard driver and in theory 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.560
 Thakura should work if it is not 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.380
 helped you can update the driver when 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.510
 driver support from the official site 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.660
 support your laptop ie you 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.190
 go to the internet find the official 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.730
 website of your laptop manufacturer 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.280
 find your laptop model and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.070
 find in the support section find 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 driver which is designed for windows 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.290
 8 for the same as you 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.330
 type of system the same as you type 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.910
 system ie 64 bit or 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.160
 32-bit here download this driver 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.290
 for your keyboard and installs it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.959
 and check if everything works 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.950
 what was said is not in my opinion 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.330
 another way is possible that some 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.150
 keyboard abnormalities have occurred 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.790
 at violation or change of settings 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.480
 bios such a case recommend you go 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.870
 in bios and bios 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 Well, the easiest way is to reset 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.190
 settings, that is, there is such a function 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.049
 reset bios settings you 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.180
 resets both settings and reboot 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.590
 computer if even after that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.000
 the keyboard does not work then 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.480
 the only way to solve this problem 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.159
 is to go to the service center 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.430
 principle on this all with you was the channel about 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:06.530
 windows 8 all for now and remember that any 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.530
 the problem can be solved most importantly know how
