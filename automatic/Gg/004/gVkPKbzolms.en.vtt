00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:59.549
 If you 're in gear, you're better off. 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:04.049
 why do you already compensate ipeac from psp to 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:07.019
 Who pays for it and is ready 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.420
 ready now you can already run oo 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 server is and takes a while to start 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.040
 because there are several molds 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.970

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.310
 so let's go for good minecraft here 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.769
 minecraft has two dead who are not 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.010
 installed in multiplayer that does not have 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.549

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.700

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:48.489
 You take the fee on the hand it lights, I'll go. 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.489

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:12.940
 illuminating the type path make a 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.850
 hole down there that goes dark 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.370
 You play the torch, she's going or not too. 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:24.760
 It's good if it takes gaag there on the edge. 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.640
 Tell me, Kate, do you have my share? 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.750

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:35.110
