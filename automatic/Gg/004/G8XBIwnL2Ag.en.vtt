it's running great and I did a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.660 
it's running great and I did a
modification<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:19.100> I've<00:00:20.100> been<00:00:20.250> thinking<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
modification here I've been thinking of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
modification here I've been thinking of
doing<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> while<00:00:21.350> but<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.619> never<00:00:22.800> got

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
doing for a while but I just never got

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.050 
doing for a while but I just never got
around<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.519> doing<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.019> that's<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.130> took

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
around to doing and that's that I took

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.160 
around to doing and that's that I took
this<00:00:27.449> Arizona<00:00:28.050> camp<00:00:28.500> Arizona<00:00:29.099> iced<00:00:29.340> tea<00:00:29.580> came

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
here I wish I had another bike to make a

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.940 
here I wish I had another bike to make a
comparison<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:30.020> don't<00:01:30.830> so<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:32.950> hope

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
comparison with but I don't so I hope

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.020 
comparison with but I don't so I hope
that<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:34.250> could<00:01:34.370> just<00:01:34.460> watch<00:01:34.700> another

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
that you could just watch another

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.170 
that you could just watch another
YouTube<00:01:35.510> video<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.110> see<00:01:36.380> how<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.760> exhaustion

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
YouTube video and see how the exhaustion

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.180 
YouTube video and see how the exhaustion
on<00:01:38.300> these<00:01:38.510> sounds<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.440> already<00:01:39.770> cut<00:01:40.070> off

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
on these sounds and I already cut off

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.010 
on these sounds and I already cut off
part<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.790> baffle<00:01:41.450> in<00:01:41.720> there<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:44.020> that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
part of the baffle in there and that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.470 
part of the baffle in there and that
made<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.350> sound<00:01:46.310> cooler<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.120> little<00:01:47.360> bit

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
made it sound cooler and a little bit

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.940 
made it sound cooler and a little bit
louder<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.020> more<00:01:48.080> powerful<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:48.980> this<00:01:49.760> just

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
louder and more powerful and this just

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.640 
louder and more powerful and this just
multiplied<00:01:51.950> that<00:01:52.250> even<00:01:52.850> more<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:53.450> think<00:01:54.440> it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
multiplied that even more I think it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.720 
multiplied that even more I think it
looks<00:01:54.800> pretty<00:01:54.980> cool<00:01:55.250> too

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.190 

and<00:02:01.730> now<00:02:01.910> one<00:02:02.180> thing<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.600> want<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.930> do<00:02:03.080> is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
and now one thing that I want to do is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.740 
and now one thing that I want to do is
just<00:02:03.380> extend<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:04.220> exhaust<00:02:04.640> pipe<00:02:04.970> or<00:02:05.150> bend<00:02:05.540> it

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
just extend the exhaust pipe or bend it

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.190 
just extend the exhaust pipe or bend it
a<00:02:05.840> little

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
a little

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.840 
a little
and<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:07.160> guess<00:02:07.340> no<00:02:07.550> more<00:02:07.820> comes<00:02:08.270> out<00:02:08.860> on<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and I guess no more comes out on the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.780 
and I guess no more comes out on the
side<00:02:11.240> over<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:12.130> see<00:02:13.130> then<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.490> hear<00:02:13.700> it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
side over here see then you can hear it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.140 
side over here see then you can hear it
even<00:02:13.880> better<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.980> that's<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.940> sound

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
even better and that's just the sound

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.300 
even better and that's just the sound
really<00:02:17.330> cool<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.870> way<00:02:18.160> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
