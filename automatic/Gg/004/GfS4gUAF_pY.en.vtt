a<00:00:44.910> micro<00:00:45.120> USB<00:00:45.329> charger<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.680> takes<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.039> micro

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
a micro USB charger this takes a micro

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.080 
a micro USB charger this takes a micro
USB<00:00:47.460> charger<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.480> an<00:00:48.629> impulse<00:00:49.050> input

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
USB charger so that's an impulse input

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.840 
USB charger so that's an impulse input
voltage<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.270> 5<00:00:51.960> volts<00:00:52.410> direct<00:00:53.309> current<00:00:53.610> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
voltage of 5 volts direct current this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.290 
voltage of 5 volts direct current this
has<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> 19<00:00:54.719> volt<00:00:54.960> input<00:00:55.969> which<00:00:56.969> pretty<00:00:57.180> much

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
has a 19 volt input which pretty much

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
has a 19 volt input which pretty much
rules<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:58.309> wiring<00:00:59.309> anything<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.090> car<00:01:00.559> in

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
rules out wiring anything to your car in

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
rules out wiring anything to your car in
an<00:01:01.829> easy<00:01:02.160> fashion<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.600> dt<00:01:04.199> 989<00:01:05.159> 10<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> 12

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
an easy fashion the dt 989 10 take a 12

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
an easy fashion the dt 989 10 take a 12
volt<00:01:06.780> input<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.010> pretty<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.729> cut

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
volt input so pretty much you can cut

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
volt input so pretty much you can cut
the<00:01:09.090> wires<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.900> splice<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.439> right

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the wires on that and splice it right

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
the wires on that and splice it right
into<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:10.979> vehicle<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.450> trying<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
into your vehicle if you are trying to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
into your vehicle if you are trying to
mount<00:01:13.020> something<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.150> said

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
mount something up like that like I said

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
mount something up like that like I said
these<00:01:15.509> both<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> micro<00:01:17.369> USB<00:01:18.470> input<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.950> if

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
these both use a micro USB input so if

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
these both use a micro USB input so if
you<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.340> micro<00:01:20.670> USB<00:01:21.140> charger<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.350> your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you have micro USB charger in your

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.980 
you have micro USB charger in your
vehicle<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.670> connect<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
vehicle you can just connect it to the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420 
vehicle you can just connect it to the
back<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.520> they<00:01:26.520> output<00:01:27.119> 1<00:01:27.540> amp<00:01:28.310> for<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
back of that they output 1 amp for the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.520 
back of that they output 1 amp for the
wcp<00:01:30.380> 400<00:01:31.380> 1<00:01:31.950> amp<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> wcp<00:01:33.020> 700<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
wcp 400 1 amp for the wcp 700 and the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.460 
wcp 400 1 amp for the wcp 700 and the
Nokia<00:01:34.890> Chargers<00:01:35.400> seem<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> output<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.659> 750

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Nokia Chargers seem to output only 750

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.280 
Nokia Chargers seem to output only 750
milliamp<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:38.880> consideration

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
milliamp so take that into consideration

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
milliamp so take that into consideration
when<00:01:40.290> you're<00:01:40.680> trying<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> charge<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> device

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
when you're trying to charge a device

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
when you're trying to charge a device
and<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.659> rates<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.470> will<00:01:43.560> expect<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.009> see

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and the rates you will expect to see

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.929 
and the rates you will expect to see
this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> LG<00:01:45.390> optimus<00:01:45.570> g<00:01:46.409> pro<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> normal

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

travel<00:01:48.360> charger<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.110> device<00:01:50.990> outputs

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
travel charger on this device outputs

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.160 
travel charger on this device outputs
1.8<00:01:52.710> amps<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.399> anything<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> hear<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.049> know

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
1.8 amps so anything I go to hear I know

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
1.8 amps so anything I go to hear I know
for<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> fact<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> charge<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
for a fact it's going to charge at a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.770 
for a fact it's going to charge at a
slower<00:01:58.259> rate<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.610> let's<00:01:59.850> go<00:01:59.969> ahead<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.240> open

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
slower rate so let's go ahead and open

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.740 
slower rate so let's go ahead and open
this<00:02:00.899> up

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.690 

due<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.930> military<00:02:08.110> discount<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:09.039> was<00:02:09.250> able<00:02:09.520> to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
due to a military discount I was able to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.210 
due to a military discount I was able to
get<00:02:10.000> twenty-five<00:02:10.570> percent<00:02:10.810> off<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.560> so

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
get twenty-five percent off of this so

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.300 
get twenty-five percent off of this so
