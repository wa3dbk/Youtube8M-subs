00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.570 
to make it swung hard a little apple
just<00:00:14.330> take<00:00:15.330> an<00:00:15.450> apple<00:00:15.600> a<00:00:16.049> larger<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.220> better

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
just take an apple a larger it is better

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.029 
just take an apple a larger it is better
it<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:17.940> us<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> will<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
it is for us so it will make you a

larger<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.859> okay<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.310> cut<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> output

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
larger one okay so just cut the output

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.249 
larger one okay so just cut the output
lower<00:00:25.050> part<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> make<00:00:27.509> it<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.839> flat

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
lower part so to make it like a flat

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.170 
lower part so to make it like a flat
Apple<00:00:29.000> like<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.490> a<00:00:32.550> flat<00:00:32.759> apple

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
Apple like that so we have a flat apple

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.260 
Apple like that so we have a flat apple
right<00:00:34.100> this<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.310> we<00:00:35.400> put<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.670> aside<00:00:35.760> for

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
right this one we put them aside for

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.720 
right this one we put them aside for
later<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.190> cut<00:00:38.400> it<00:00:38.630> center<00:00:39.630> part<00:00:40.730> until

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
later you can cut it center part until

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.770 
later you can cut it center part until
you<00:00:41.910> reach<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> seeds<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:44.010> Apple<00:00:44.780> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you reach the seeds of this Apple you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
you reach the seeds of this Apple you
know<00:00:46.130> when<00:00:47.130> you<00:00:47.250> feel<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.640> seeds<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.150> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
know when you feel the seeds with a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.070 
know when you feel the seeds with a
knife<00:00:48.500> just<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.650> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:51.480> covered

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.820 

now<00:01:15.290> again<00:01:16.580> we<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.870> Al<00:01:19.110> shei

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
now again we have a little of Al shei

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.149 
now again we have a little of Al shei
piece<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.060> Apple<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> smaller

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
piece of Apple right we take the smaller

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.560 
piece of Apple right we take the smaller
spot<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:27.060> same<00:01:27.300> car<00:01:28.640> with<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
spot and we do the same car with not a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.399 
spot and we do the same car with not a
smaller<00:01:30.930> car<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.990> have

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
smaller car so what we do we just have

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
smaller car so what we do we just have
some<00:01:35.120> l-shape<00:01:36.290> pieces<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.440> Apple<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> assume

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
some l-shape pieces of Apple so assume

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.200 
some l-shape pieces of Apple so assume
we<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> l-shape<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.040> Apple<00:01:41.370> we<00:01:41.940> put

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
we have the l-shape is so Apple we put

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.830 
we have the l-shape is so Apple we put
it<00:01:42.330> together<00:01:43.700> now<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.510> do<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it together now we're going to do the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.410 
it together now we're going to do the
same<00:01:46.080> thing<00:01:46.440> with<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.010> other<00:01:47.130> piece<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.640> offal

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.120 

when<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.630> reach<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.200> seeds<00:01:57.300> we<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.890> cut

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
when we reach the seeds we going to cut

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.870 
when we reach the seeds we going to cut
amount<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:04.060> shade<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:06.220> are<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.730> have

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
pack the Apple as in an L shape one of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.240 
pack the Apple as in an L shape one of
these<00:02:21.880> two<00:02:22.180> or<00:02:22.450> three<00:02:22.660> times<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.950> we're<00:02:24.100> going

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to have an any piece of L shape Apple

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.030 
to have an any piece of L shape Apple
that<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.410> want<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.800> we<00:02:32.950> got<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.370> right<00:02:33.940> here

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.880 

then<00:02:56.380> we're<00:02:56.530> going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> put<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:57.160> together

then we're going to put up together

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.610 
then we're going to put up together
again<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.830> two<00:03:03.160> sides<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.000> Apple<00:03:04.620> now

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
again the two sides of the Apple now

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.479 
again the two sides of the Apple now
this<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.130> body<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.239> Swan<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:09.160> make<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
this is the body of the Swan to make the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.100 
this is the body of the Swan to make the
hair<00:03:11.430> takes<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.790> lower<00:03:13.269> part<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.900> then<00:03:13.959> we

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
hair takes to the lower part and then we

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.070 
hair takes to the lower part and then we
just<00:03:14.319> got<00:03:14.530> before<00:03:15.690> we're<00:03:16.690> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> make<00:03:16.930> it

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
just got before we're going to make it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.259 
just got before we're going to make it
flap<00:03:17.319> again<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:21.760> what<00:03:21.910> we're<00:03:22.060> going<00:03:22.180> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
flap again that's what we're going to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:52.900
