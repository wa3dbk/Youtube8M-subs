the sack and sleep in tomorrow but let's
start<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:03.870> talking<00:01:04.170> about<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:05.010> thing

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
start off talking about that one thing

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
start off talking about that one thing
that<00:01:05.339> absolutely<00:01:06.150> needs<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.810> change<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.350> don't

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that absolutely needs to change I don't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.620 
that absolutely needs to change I don't
know<00:01:07.650> why<00:01:08.010> we're<00:01:08.369> taking<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> step<00:01:09.090> backwards

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
know why we're taking a step backwards

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
know why we're taking a step backwards
it<00:01:09.780> seems<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.350> sometimes<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> Call<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> Duty

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it seems like sometimes a Call of Duty

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
it seems like sometimes a Call of Duty
comes<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:12.869> change<00:01:13.200> something<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
comes out and they change something and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
comes out and they change something and
it<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.400> works<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.630> really

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it really works out and it's a really

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
it really works out and it's a really
good<00:01:16.170> change<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> next<00:01:17.549> Call<00:01:17.939> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
good change but then the next Call of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
good change but then the next Call of
Duty<00:01:18.090> comes<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.290> backwards<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
Duty comes out and they go backwards to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
Duty comes out and they go backwards to
the<00:01:20.220> way<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the way it was that's kind of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
the way it was that's kind of
frustrating<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:22.680> know<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.070> that's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
frustrating I don't know if that's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
frustrating I don't know if that's
because<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> game<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.540> already

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
because you know this game is already

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
because you know this game is already
being<00:01:25.409> planned<00:01:25.920> while<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> new<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.360> is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
being planned while that new game is

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.030 
being planned while that new game is
coming<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.380> they're<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.740> really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
coming out and so they're not really

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
coming out and so they're not really
aware<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> lack<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
aware of it or if it's just a lack of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.560 
aware of it or if it's just a lack of
communication<00:01:31.680> between<00:01:32.329> Treyarch<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
communication between Treyarch and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
communication between Treyarch and
Infinity<00:01:34.110> Ward<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> lot

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
Infinity Ward and I know there was a lot

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340 
Infinity Ward and I know there was a lot
of<00:01:35.520> things<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.329> Infinity<00:01:37.110> Ward

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of things going on with Infinity Ward

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
of things going on with Infinity Ward
but<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.189> area<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> really

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
but one area that I think that really

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
but one area that I think that really
needs<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.079> changed<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.250> actually

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
needs to be changed is when you actually

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.840 
needs to be changed is when you actually
cap<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.329> flag<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.460> Kill

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
cap a flag or if you get that Kill

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
cap a flag or if you get that Kill
Confirmed<00:01:44.880> tag<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.280> credit

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Confirmed tag you do not get credit

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
Confirmed tag you do not get credit
towards<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.299> score<00:01:48.780> Street<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
towards your score Street for that I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
towards your score Street for that I
just<00:01:50.100> personally<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> step

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
just personally think that is a step

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
just personally think that is a step
backwards<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.159> need<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> change<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
backwards and we need to change it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
backwards and we need to change it
especially<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.470> shoot<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.979> SATCOM

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
especially when you shoot a SATCOM

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
especially when you shoot a SATCOM
that's<00:01:56.850> sitting<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> floor<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's sitting on the floor and that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
that's sitting on the floor and that
actually<00:01:58.590> gives<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.159> credit<00:01:59.549> towards<00:02:00.060> your

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
actually gives you credit towards your

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
actually gives you credit towards your
score<00:02:00.600> streak<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:01.770> kill<00:02:02.009> streak<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
score streak or your kill streak you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
score streak or your kill streak you
know<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.390> doesn't<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:03.780> any<00:02:03.840> sense

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
know that just doesn't make any sense

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
know that just doesn't make any sense
all<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> just

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
all this is going to do is just

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
all this is going to do is just
encourage<00:02:06.750> people<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.039> play<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
encourage people to not play the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
encourage people to not play the
objectives<00:02:09.780> people<00:02:10.110> are<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
objectives people are just going to be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
objectives people are just going to be
sitting<00:02:10.770> back<00:02:11.039> going<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:12.060> their<00:02:12.209> score

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
sitting back going for their score

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.580 
sitting back going for their score
streaks<00:02:12.870> their<00:02:13.140> kills

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
streaks their kills

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.900 
streaks their kills
Streaks<00:02:13.800> whatever<00:02:14.190> they're<00:02:14.340> called<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.730> this

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
Streaks whatever they're called in this

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.940 
Streaks whatever they're called in this
game<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.420> they're<00:02:15.870> gonna<00:02:16.019> rack<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.739> their

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
game and they're gonna rack up their

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.009 
game and they're gonna rack up their
Katy<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.879> worry<00:02:18.239> about<00:02:18.330> actually

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
Katy and not worry about actually

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.800 
Katy and not worry about actually
playing<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.709> game<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.390> really

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
playing the game so I think that really

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
playing the game so I think that really
needs<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.260> changed<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.860> mean<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.340> don't<00:02:23.400> know

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
needs to be changed I mean I don't know

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.339 
needs to be changed I mean I don't know
about<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.080> most

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
about you but one of the most

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.369 
about you but one of the most
frustrating<00:02:26.190> things<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.610> me<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.989> cop

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
frustrating things for me is when I cop

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.990 
frustrating things for me is when I cop
on<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> game<00:02:28.950> especially<00:02:29.190> when<00:02:29.580> I'm<00:02:29.790> playing

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
on a game especially when I'm playing

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.729 
on a game especially when I'm playing
with<00:02:30.120> randoms<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.989> get<00:02:31.170> paired<00:02:31.560> with

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
with randoms and you get paired with

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.100 
with randoms and you get paired with
people<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.519> have<00:02:32.790> no<00:02:33.090> concern<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.540> picking

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
people that have no concern for picking

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.350 
people that have no concern for picking
up<00:02:34.260> tags<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.250> capping<00:02:35.640> flags<00:02:35.910> or<00:02:36.150> anything

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
up tags or for capping flags or anything

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000 
up tags or for capping flags or anything
like<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.660> you're<00:02:37.200> gonna<00:02:37.319> see<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.799> game

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
like that you're gonna see in this game

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.890 
like that you're gonna see in this game
mode<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.519> get<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.970> most<00:02:39.000> captures<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.720> mean

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
mode that I get the most captures I mean

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.930

that is my goal I wanted to play the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.699 
that is my goal I wanted to play the
objectives<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.599> tell<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.049> if<00:02:43.230> you

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
objectives and I tell you what if you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.140 
objectives and I tell you what if you
don't<00:02:43.739> want<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.069> play<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> objectives<00:02:44.970> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
don't want to play the objectives and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.759 
don't want to play the objectives and

Kill Confirmed or domination or
something<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.099> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
something like that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.539 
something like that
go<00:02:47.819> play<00:02:48.120> TDM<00:02:48.660> go<00:02:49.290> play<00:02:49.560> free-for-all<00:02:50.220> because

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
go play TDM go play free-for-all because

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.339 
go play TDM go play free-for-all because
honestly<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.269> don't<00:02:51.390> want<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> get<00:02:51.930> paired<00:02:52.200> up

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
honestly I don't want to get paired up

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.080 
honestly I don't want to get paired up
in<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> room<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.730> sounds

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
in a room with you and if that sounds

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.240 
in a room with you and if that sounds
harsh<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:54.989> probably<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.799> said<00:02:56.010> because

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
harsh it's probably like I said because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
harsh it's probably like I said because
I'm<00:02:56.430> running<00:02:56.579> on<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.000> two<00:02:57.209> hours<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.840> sleep

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
I'm running on that two hours of sleep

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.869 
I'm running on that two hours of sleep
but<00:02:58.680> let<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.069> know<00:02:59.220> what<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.730> about

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
but let me know what you think about

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.550 
but let me know what you think about
that<00:03:00.239> let<00:03:00.450> me<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.629> if<00:03:00.750> anything<00:03:01.110> else<00:03:01.230> needs

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that let me know if anything else needs

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.319 
that let me know if anything else needs
to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.860> changed<00:03:02.250> when<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.579> comes<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.090> these

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
to be changed when it comes to these

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.809 
to be changed when it comes to these
objective<00:03:04.049> type<00:03:04.319> games<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.190> let's<00:03:05.430> move<00:03:05.640> on

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
objective type games but let's move on

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.080 
objective type games but let's move on
and<00:03:06.030> talk<00:03:06.209> about<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.250> arx-160<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.849> may

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and talk about the arx-160 I think I may

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.650 
and talk about the arx-160 I think I may
have<00:03:09.120> called<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.340> axr<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.700> probably<00:03:12.329> did

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
have called it the axr I probably did

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.690 
have called it the axr I probably did
that<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.230> reminds<00:03:13.530> me<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.920> ACR

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
that because it reminds me of the ACR

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.699 
that because it reminds me of the ACR
just<00:03:15.030> because<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.510> its<00:03:15.660> fire<00:03:16.079> rate<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.590> how

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
just because of its fire rate and how

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.750 
just because of its fire rate and how
smooth<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.370> fires<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.540> supposedly<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
smooth it fires this is supposedly the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.410 
smooth it fires this is supposedly the
fastest<00:03:20.760> firing

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
fastest firing

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.289

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.319 
things that are really cool about this
gun<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:28.200> comes<00:03:28.549> built-in<00:03:29.549> with<00:03:30.090> a

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
gun is that it comes built-in with a

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.780 
gun is that it comes built-in with a
laser<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.139> not<00:03:31.440> only<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.859> this<00:03:32.099> gun<00:03:32.340> gonna<00:03:32.639> be

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
laser so not only is this gun gonna be

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.569 
laser so not only is this gun gonna be
great<00:03:33.180> at<00:03:33.450> range<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.560> it's<00:03:34.709> also<00:03:34.980> gonna<00:03:35.370> be

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
great at range but it's also gonna be

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.759 
great at range but it's also gonna be
pretty<00:03:35.910> darn<00:03:36.209> good<00:03:36.480> when<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.109> comes<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.530> hip

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
pretty darn good when it comes to hip

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.220 
pretty darn good when it comes to hip
firing<00:03:38.310> up<00:03:38.519> close<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.660> only<00:03:39.780> thing<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.049> I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
firing up close so the only thing that I

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.990 
firing up close so the only thing that I
think<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.590> need<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:40.980> add<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.549> this<00:03:41.700> weapon

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
think you need to add to this weapon

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.990 
think you need to add to this weapon
when<00:03:42.389> you're<00:03:42.540> playing<00:03:42.750> core<00:03:43.079> game<00:03:43.319> modes<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.799> a

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
when you're playing core game modes is a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.129 
when you're playing core game modes is a
suppressor<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.030> way<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.419> do<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.840> show<00:03:46.109> up

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
suppressor that way you do not show up

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.319 
suppressor that way you do not show up
on<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.530> mini-map<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.489> said<00:03:47.849> two<00:03:48.090> things

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
on that mini-map now I said two things

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.640 
on that mini-map now I said two things
are<00:03:48.480> really<00:03:48.690> cool<00:03:48.840> about<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.169> weapon<00:03:49.560> you

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
are really cool about this weapon you

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.500 
are really cool about this weapon you
know<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> first<00:03:50.010> one<00:03:50.190> being<00:03:50.340> laser<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:51.239> other

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
know the first one being laser the other

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.229 
know the first one being laser the other
thing<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.380> first<00:03:52.739> three<00:03:53.190> rounds<00:03:53.519> out<00:03:53.880> of

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
thing is the first three rounds out of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.930 
thing is the first three rounds out of
this<00:03:54.419> weapon<00:03:54.989> have<00:03:55.470> reduced<00:03:56.010> recoil<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
this weapon have reduced recoil now the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.539 
this weapon have reduced recoil now the
recoil<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.410> hearty<00:03:58.859> pretty<00:03:59.099> darn<00:03:59.370> good

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
recoil on it is hearty pretty darn good

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.670 
recoil on it is hearty pretty darn good
I<00:03:59.819> think<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.450> even<00:04:00.690> gets<00:04:00.840> better<00:04:01.079> when<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.500> add

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
I think it even gets better when you add

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.550 
I think it even gets better when you add
the<00:04:01.829> suppressor<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.419> that<00:04:03.660> also<00:04:03.959> buff

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
the suppressor but with that also buff

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.800 
the suppressor but with that also buff
of<00:04:04.889> having<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.340> first<00:04:05.669> three<00:04:06.000> rounds<00:04:06.269> come<00:04:06.660> up

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
of having the first three rounds come up

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.800 
of having the first three rounds come up
at<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.260> reduced<00:04:07.980> recoil<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.910> even<00:04:09.209> gets<00:04:09.389> even

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
at a reduced recoil it even gets even

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.559 
at a reduced recoil it even gets even
better<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:10.980> far<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.639> is<00:04:11.880> one<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.239> my

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
better so so far this is one of my

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.690 
better so so far this is one of my
favourite<00:04:13.109> assault<00:04:13.530> rifles<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.220> game<00:04:14.400> and

you<00:04:58.409> have<00:04:58.620> other<00:04:58.800> options<00:04:59.039> like<00:04:59.490> light

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
you have other options like light

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.360 
you have other options like light
machineguns<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.509> sniper<00:05:00.870> rifles<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.590> probably

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
machineguns and sniper rifles I probably

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.879 
machineguns and sniper rifles I probably
stay<00:05:02.789> away<00:05:02.819> from<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.449> sniper<00:05:03.719> rifle<00:05:04.229> unless

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
stay away from the sniper rifle unless

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.800 
stay away from the sniper rifle unless
you<00:05:05.099> have<00:05:05.250> prior<00:05:05.520> Call<00:05:05.909> of<00:05:05.940> Duty<00:05:06.300> experience

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
you have prior Call of Duty experience

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.209 
you have prior Call of Duty experience
just<00:05:07.080> because<00:05:07.379> there's<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.680> little<00:05:07.860> bit<00:05:08.039> of<00:05:08.069> a

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
just because there's a little bit of a

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.159 
just because there's a little bit of a
learning<00:05:08.400> curve<00:05:08.580> with<00:05:08.969> it<00:05:09.180> but<00:05:09.599> starting<00:05:10.050> off

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
learning curve with it but starting off

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.309 
learning curve with it but starting off
definitely<00:05:10.770> run<00:05:11.039> an<00:05:11.280> SMG<00:05:11.849> or<00:05:12.300> an<00:05:12.990> assault

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
definitely run an SMG or an assault

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.619 
definitely run an SMG or an assault
rifle<00:05:13.379> run<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.099> silence<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.819> way<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.060> can<00:05:15.449> go

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
rifle run it silence that way you can go

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.350 
rifle run it silence that way you can go
capify<00:05:16.289> get<00:05:16.620> some<00:05:16.889> kills<00:05:17.159> in<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.520> enemy<00:05:18.060> spawn

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
capify get some kills in the enemy spawn

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.379 
capify get some kills in the enemy spawn
and<00:05:18.690> hopefully<00:05:19.379> stay<00:05:19.740> undetected<00:05:20.400> now

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
and hopefully stay undetected now

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.529 
and hopefully stay undetected now
besides<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.560> weapon<00:05:23.069> you<00:05:23.219> probably<00:05:23.819> want<00:05:24.389> to

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
besides the weapon you probably want to

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.469 
besides the weapon you probably want to
run<00:05:24.960> some<00:05:25.620> lower<00:05:25.949> score<00:05:26.520> streaks<00:05:26.879> just<00:05:27.330> when

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
run some lower score streaks just when

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.240 
run some lower score streaks just when
you're<00:05:27.629> starting<00:05:27.960> out<00:05:28.229> now<00:05:28.440> domination<00:05:29.129> is

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
you're starting out now domination is

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.339 
you're starting out now domination is
one<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.550> those<00:05:29.669> game<00:05:30.060> types<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.139> can

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
one of those game types that you can

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.230 
one of those game types that you can
really<00:05:31.620> rack<00:05:31.949> up<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.340> high<00:05:32.520> score<00:05:32.880> streaks

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
really rack up the high score streaks

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.480 
really rack up the high score streaks
but<00:05:33.509> in<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.810> first<00:05:34.080> week<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.650> this<00:05:34.830> or<00:05:35.279> the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
but in the first week of this or the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.040 
but in the first week of this or the
first<00:05:35.789> you<00:05:36.090> know<00:05:36.210> couple<00:05:36.479> days<00:05:36.719> you<00:05:36.900> might

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
first you know couple days you might

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.689 
first you know couple days you might
want<00:05:37.259> to<00:05:37.319> run<00:05:37.469> some<00:05:37.680> lower<00:05:37.889> ones<00:05:38.190> so<00:05:38.430> I'd

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
want to run some lower ones so I'd

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.339 
want to run some lower ones so I'd
really<00:05:39.210> recommend<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.779> SATCOM

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
really recommend the SATCOM

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.519 
really recommend the SATCOM
dog<00:05:41.099> and<00:05:41.460> then<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.940> sentry<00:05:42.389> gun<00:05:42.419> or<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.349> could

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
dog and then the sentry gun or you could

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.249 
dog and then the sentry gun or you could
replace<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.250> dog<00:05:44.520> with<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.240> IMS<00:05:46.050> the

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
replace the dog with the IMS the

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.800 
replace the dog with the IMS the
intelligent<00:05:47.039> munitions<00:05:47.639> system<00:05:48.210> now<00:05:48.750> the

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
intelligent munitions system now the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.300 
intelligent munitions system now the
difference<00:05:49.349> is<00:05:49.560> if<00:05:49.770> you're<00:05:49.949> the<00:05:50.099> type<00:05:50.279> of

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
difference is if you're the type of

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.249 
difference is if you're the type of
player<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:50.639> likes<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.180> run<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:51.690> go<00:05:51.840> for<00:05:52.110> the
