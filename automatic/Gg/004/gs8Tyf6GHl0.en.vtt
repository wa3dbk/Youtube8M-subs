00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.040 

but<00:06:06.460> if<00:06:06.610> he<00:06:06.699> had<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:06.940> be<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:07.060> big<00:06:07.419> he<00:06:07.780> probably

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
but if he had to be that big he probably

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.000 
but if he had to be that big he probably
been<00:06:08.440> hooked<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.770> couple<00:06:09.070> times<00:06:10.740> maybe<00:06:11.740> that's

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
been hooked a couple times maybe that's

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:19.690
