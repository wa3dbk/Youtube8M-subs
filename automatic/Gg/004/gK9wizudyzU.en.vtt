these new measures in California to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.230 
these new measures in California to
conserve<00:00:01.860> water<00:00:02.100> are<00:00:02.429> really<00:00:02.790> nothing<00:00:03.210> new

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
conserve water are really nothing new

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.630 
conserve water are really nothing new
maybe<00:00:03.899> they<00:00:04.110> are<00:00:04.230> for<00:00:04.410> California<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.400> cities

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
maybe they are for California for cities

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.190 
maybe they are for California for cities

analyst lion-o of Lionel media and I
began<00:00:21.180> by<00:00:21.240> asking<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.779> professor<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
began by asking the professor about the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.439 
began by asking the professor about the
fact<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.189> California<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> measure<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
fact that in California this measure is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.790 
fact that in California this measure is
actually<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.560> changing<00:00:26.189> culture<00:00:27.800> absolute

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
actually about changing culture absolute

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.150 
actually about changing culture absolute
so<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.849> look<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> history<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:31.160> water

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
so if you look at the history of water

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.270 
so if you look at the history of water
development<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.820> dry<00:00:33.270> areas<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> ward<00:00:34.680> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
development in dry areas of the ward you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
development in dry areas of the ward you
always<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.059> era<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.290> call<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
always see this era that we call the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.369 
always see this era that we call the
hydraulic<00:00:38.460> mission<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.300> try<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> prove

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
hydraulic mission that we try to prove

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
hydraulic mission that we try to prove
that<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.340> beat<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> nature<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that we can beat the nature and make it

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.639 
that we can beat the nature and make it
ideal<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.969> ourselves<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.600> live<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> way

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
ideal for ourselves and live in the way

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
ideal for ourselves and live in the way
that<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> long<00:00:48.300> people<00:00:48.899> in

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that we like so for for a long people in

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.459 
that we like so for for a long people in
California<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.739> tried<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.700> prove<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
California have tried to prove that

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
California have tried to prove that
water<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> limitation<00:00:53.489> water<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
water is not a limitation water is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
water is not a limitation water is
definitely<00:00:54.870> an<00:00:54.989> ident<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.710> gives

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
definitely an ident you know gives

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.090 
definitely an ident you know gives
identity<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.910> state<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> successful

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
identity to this state and so successful

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
identity to this state and so successful
it<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.030> Californians<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.780> been<00:01:00.989> successful

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it the Californians have been successful

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.149 
it the Californians have been successful
to<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.710> good<00:01:01.920> extent<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:03.589> running<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> water<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
to a good extent in running the water in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.270 
to a good extent in running the water in
the<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.770> now<00:01:07.950> we're

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the way they want it but but now we're

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.700 
the way they want it but but now we're
learning<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.970> mean<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.630> why<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
learning you mean but it's why are you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
learning you mean but it's why are you
know<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.430> cause<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.970> us<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.240> we're

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
know it has a bit cause for us but we're

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.140 
know it has a bit cause for us but we're
learning<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.930> California<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.670> we<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
learning in California that we have to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
learning in California that we have to
change<00:01:15.390> our<00:01:15.540> attitude<00:01:16.020> toward<00:01:16.560> water<00:01:16.830> at

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
change our attitude toward water at

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
change our attitude toward water at
California<00:01:17.909> might<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> place<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
California might not be the place that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
California might not be the place that
we<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> terms<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.340> water<00:01:20.549> availability

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
we think in terms of water availability

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.630 
we think in terms of water availability
at<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.080> moment<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.830> bankrupt<00:01:23.460> in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
at the moment it's it's bankrupt in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
at the moment it's it's bankrupt in
terms<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.030> water<00:01:24.810> resources<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
terms of water resources and we have to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.190 
terms of water resources and we have to
change<00:01:26.340> attitude<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.080> an

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
change attitude so I see this as an

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.920 
change attitude so I see this as an
opportunity<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:29.119> Californians<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.630> change

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
opportunity for Californians to change

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
opportunity for Californians to change
attitude<00:01:31.500> change<00:01:32.100> their<00:01:32.310> culture<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
attitude change their culture and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.120 
attitude change their culture and
understand<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.780> limitations<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:34.650> exist

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
understand the limitations which exist

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
understand the limitations which exist
and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> improves<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and I think that that improves the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
and I think that that improves the
system<00:01:37.829> improves<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> water<00:01:38.909> management

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
system improves the water management

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.410 
system improves the water management
system<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.520> increases<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> efficiency<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
system and increases the efficiency of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
system and increases the efficiency of
water<00:01:43.290> management<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.890> water<00:01:43.979> uses<00:01:44.460> across

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
water management of water uses across

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.429 
water management of water uses across
the<00:01:44.939> state<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.479> sectors<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the state in all sectors well go and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.280 
the state in all sectors well go and
quite<00:01:46.680> frankly<00:01:46.790> California<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.360> desert<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
quite frankly California is a desert it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.590 
quite frankly California is a desert it
has<00:01:49.740> mountainous<00:01:50.310> regions<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
has mountainous regions and it has you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.210

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
and people watering their lawns yes so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.350 
and people watering their lawns yes so
exactly<00:02:28.680> i<00:02:28.890> mean<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.610> situation<00:02:29.820> we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
exactly i mean this is the situation we

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.770 
exactly i mean this is the situation we
have<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:31.280> many<00:02:32.280> regions<00:02:32.520> many<00:02:32.970> areas<00:02:33.360> regions

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
have in many regions many areas regions

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.699 
have in many regions many areas regions
are<00:02:33.959> which<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:35.100> have<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:36.000> big<00:02:36.709> agricultural

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
are which we have a big agricultural

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.560 
are which we have a big agricultural
sectors<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.760> eighty<00:02:38.940> percent<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
sectors so it you know eighty percent is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.900 
sectors so it you know eighty percent is
a<00:02:39.630> big<00:02:40.080> number<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.680> course<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.670> it's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
a big number of course but but it's it's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.880 
a big number of course but but it's it's
it's<00:02:42.180> common<00:02:42.570> if<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> middle<00:02:43.470> easier

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
it's common if you go to middle easier

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.979 
it's common if you go to middle easier
they're<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.400> same<00:02:44.790> numbers<00:02:45.180> many<00:02:45.600> parts<00:02:45.870> of

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
they're the same numbers many parts of

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.650 
they're the same numbers many parts of
the<00:02:46.080> developing<00:02:46.260> world<00:02:46.830> way<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.130> have

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
the developing world way we have

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.150 
the developing world way we have
agriculture<00:02:48.660> agriculture<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.709> going<00:02:50.010> on

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
agriculture agriculture this is going on

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.280 
agriculture agriculture this is going on
of<00:02:50.340> course<00:02:50.370> california<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.300> not<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> developing

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
of course california is not a developing

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.560 
of course california is not a developing
place<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.160> agriculture<00:02:53.850> has<00:02:54.000> been<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> bit

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
place but but agriculture has been a bit

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.229 
place but but agriculture has been a bit
big<00:02:54.840> industry<00:02:55.680> here<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.459> important<00:02:57.000> for

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
big industry here and it's important for

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.830 
big industry here and it's important for
for<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:57.989> state<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.270> continues

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
for this state and so so this continues

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900 
for this state and so so this continues
but<00:03:01.020> when<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.500> think<00:03:01.860> about<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.489> AG<00:03:02.640> sector

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
but when we think about it the AG sector

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.390 
but when we think about it the AG sector
has<00:03:03.420> been<00:03:03.630> already<00:03:03.780> hit<00:03:04.200> by<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.709> restrictions

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
has been already hit by the restrictions

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.180 
has been already hit by the restrictions
over<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> last<00:03:05.910> few<00:03:06.390> years<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.470> so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
over the last few years and and and so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
over the last few years and and and so
they're<00:03:08.400> they're<00:03:08.850> having<00:03:09.300> restrictions<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
they're they're having restrictions the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.600 
they're they're having restrictions the
price<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.620> probably<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> cost<00:03:11.430> of

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
price is probably the cost of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.300 
price is probably the cost of
agriculture<00:03:12.180> has<00:03:12.300> gone<00:03:12.570> up<00:03:12.750> some<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> some

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
agriculture has gone up some of the some

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.060 
agriculture has gone up some of the some
of<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> smaller<00:03:15.300> forms<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:15.959> let's<00:03:16.170> say<00:03:16.320> forms

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
of the smaller forms or let's say forms

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.430 
of the smaller forms or let's say forms
with<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.519> lower<00:03:17.730> efficiencies<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:19.200> gone

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
with with lower efficiencies have gone

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.990 
with with lower efficiencies have gone
out<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.620> business<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.430> will<00:03:20.610> continue

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
out of business and this will continue

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.400 
out of business and this will continue
so<00:03:21.360> water<00:03:21.780> continues<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.350> go<00:03:22.650> toward<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
so water continues to go toward the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.800 
so water continues to go toward the
places<00:03:25.410> where<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.940> more<00:03:27.180> valuable<00:03:27.420> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
places where it is more valuable and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.960 
places where it is more valuable and
that's<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.170> all<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> beauty<00:03:29.280> i<00:03:29.310> would<00:03:29.610> say<00:03:29.790> an

that's and all the beauty i would say an

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.430 
when it comes to economics of water
resources<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.390> market<00:03:39.690> which<00:03:40.019> exists

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
resources but the market which exists

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.949 
resources but the market which exists
here<00:03:40.590> has<00:03:40.769> facility<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.630> facilitated<00:03:42.630> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
here has facility that facilitated this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.620 
here has facility that facilitated this
so<00:03:43.200> water<00:03:43.739> will<00:03:43.829> eventually<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:44.760> we<00:03:45.150> are<00:03:45.299> we

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
so water will eventually if we are we

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.539 
so water will eventually if we are we
have<00:03:45.840> better<00:03:46.079> uses<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.500> water<00:03:46.890> we're<00:03:47.400> going

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
have better uses for water we're going

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.850 
have better uses for water we're going
to<00:03:47.610> move<00:03:47.850> water<00:03:48.090> from<00:03:48.209> agriculture<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.140> two

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
to move water from agriculture to two

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.650 
to move water from agriculture to two
cities<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.340> urban<00:03:50.610> areas<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.239> has<00:03:51.450> been

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
cities in urban areas and that has been

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.020 
cities in urban areas and that has been
happening<00:03:51.870> hey<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.489> it's<00:03:53.730> part<00:03:53.940> of

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
happening hey I think it's it's part of

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.729 
happening hey I think it's it's part of
a<00:03:54.120> good<00:03:54.299> you<00:03:54.510> know<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> good<00:03:55.290> thing<00:03:55.350> for<00:03:55.620> the

underneath<00:06:10.050> Libya<00:06:10.860> you<00:06:11.039> I<00:06:11.069> think<00:06:11.279> you<00:06:11.399> called

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
underneath Libya you I think you called

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.159 
underneath Libya you I think you called
the<00:06:11.699> Nubian<00:06:12.149> aquifers<00:06:12.629> that<00:06:12.659> would<00:06:12.899> you<00:06:12.990> refer

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
the Nubian aquifers that would you refer

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.959 
the Nubian aquifers that would you refer
to<00:06:13.199> it<00:06:13.439> as<00:06:13.529> the<00:06:13.770> Nubian<00:06:14.460> right<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.729> duty<00:06:14.939> of

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
sandstone aquifer who controls that now

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.689 
sandstone aquifer who controls that now
well<00:06:18.629> it's<00:06:18.930> funny<00:06:19.199> who<00:06:19.710> controls<00:06:19.949> Libya

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
well it's funny who controls Libya

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.749 
well it's funny who controls Libya
because<00:06:21.659> this<00:06:21.990> is<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.229> four<00:06:22.620> area<00:06:23.219> four

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
because this is a four area four

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.089 
because this is a four area four
quadrant<00:06:24.389> in<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:24.569> middle<00:06:24.810> of<00:06:24.930> Africa<00:06:25.110> because

could<00:06:40.440> be<00:06:40.560> put<00:06:40.800> into<00:06:41.009> an<00:06:41.220> 11<00:06:41.729> liter<00:06:42.030> jug<00:06:42.710> just

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
could be put into an 11 liter jug just

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.310 
could be put into an 11 liter jug just
one<00:06:44.160> cup<00:06:44.669> of<00:06:44.880> that<00:06:45.060> would<00:06:45.509> be<00:06:45.660> fresh<00:06:45.990> water

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
one cup of that would be fresh water

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.420 
one cup of that would be fresh water
with<00:06:46.949> one<00:06:47.310> drop<00:06:48.000> that<00:06:48.780> would<00:06:48.960> be<00:06:49.110> usable<00:06:49.860> so

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
with one drop that would be usable so

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.770

what you're going to see right now is

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.590 
what you're going to see right now is
take<00:06:52.199> California<00:06:53.070> and<00:06:53.570> extrapolate<00:06:54.570> that

take California and extrapolate that

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.900 
take California and extrapolate that
