might contain duplicate information now

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.749 
might contain duplicate information now
chances<00:01:11.590> are<00:01:11.770> it's<00:01:11.950> not<00:01:12.190> going<00:01:12.459> to<00:01:12.580> be

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
chances are it's not going to be

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.880 
chances are it's not going to be
whatever's<00:01:13.270> designated<00:01:13.959> as<00:01:14.080> your<00:01:14.289> primary

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
whatever's designated as your primary

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.889 
whatever's designated as your primary
key<00:01:15.100> because<00:01:15.220> primary<00:01:15.759> keys<00:01:16.030> are<00:01:16.209> not<00:01:16.420> allowed

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
key because primary keys are not allowed

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.130 
key because primary keys are not allowed
to<00:01:16.929> be<00:01:17.560> duplicated<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:19.300> what<00:01:19.750> would<00:01:19.869> more<00:01:20.110> than

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
to be duplicated so what would more than

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.650 
to be duplicated so what would more than
likely<00:01:20.319> happen<00:01:21.099> is<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.490> someone<00:01:21.880> enters<00:01:22.209> one

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
likely happen is that someone enters one

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.749 
likely happen is that someone enters one
customer<00:01:23.289> more<00:01:23.530> than<00:01:23.740> once<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.280> gives<00:01:24.520> them

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
customer more than once and gives them

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.290 
customer more than once and gives them
two<00:01:25.149> different<00:01:25.630> IDs<00:01:26.410> or<00:01:26.709> customer<00:01:27.130> IDs<00:01:27.459> so

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
two different IDs or customer IDs so

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.270 
two different IDs or customer IDs so
what<00:01:28.509> we'd<00:01:28.690> like<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.929> search<00:01:29.319> for<00:01:29.679> instead

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
what we'd like to search for instead

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.339 
what we'd like to search for instead
would<00:01:30.459> be<00:01:30.670> more<00:01:31.209> than<00:01:31.360> likely<00:01:31.569> the<00:01:31.869> company

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:32.349 
would be more than likely the company

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.770 
would be more than likely the company
name<00:01:32.590> or<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.459> contact<00:01:33.940> first<00:01:34.270> name<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.599> last

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
name or the contact first name and last

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.749 
name or the contact first name and last
name<00:01:34.959> but<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.920> lot<00:01:36.099> of<00:01:36.220> times<00:01:36.429> if<00:01:36.610> we're

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
name but a lot of times if we're

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.480 
name but a lot of times if we're
ordering<00:01:37.179> from<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.420> specific<00:01:37.709> company<00:01:38.709> a<00:01:38.920> lot

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
ordering from a specific company a lot

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.210 
ordering from a specific company a lot
of<00:01:39.520> times<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.690> contact<00:01:41.410> from<00:01:41.709> that<00:01:41.860> company

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
of times the contact from that company

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.770 
of times the contact from that company
might<00:01:42.490> change<00:01:42.819> but<00:01:43.060> all<00:01:43.209> the<00:01:43.330> company

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
might change but all the company

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.130 
might change but all the company
information<00:01:44.140> stays<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.250> same<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.750> maybe<00:01:47.050> a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
information stays the same so maybe a

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.900 
information stays the same so maybe a
company<00:01:47.739> would<00:01:47.920> be<00:01:48.039> preferred<00:01:48.489> over<00:01:48.729> the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
company would be preferred over the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.350 
company would be preferred over the
contact<00:01:49.599> first<00:01:49.840> name<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.229> last<00:01:50.289> name

contact first name and last name

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
contact first name and last name
alternatively<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.599> could<00:01:52.720> also<00:01:52.899> use<00:01:53.200> an

alternatively you could also use an

alternatively you could also use an

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
address but you might have more than one

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.010 
address but you might have more than one
particular<00:01:57.940> street<00:01:58.390> address<00:01:58.690> that's

is<00:02:08.319> search<00:02:08.709> for<00:02:09.099> more<00:02:09.369> than<00:02:09.429> one<00:02:09.640> field<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.420> you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
is search for more than one field so you

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.569 
is search for more than one field so you
could<00:02:10.720> theoretically<00:02:11.560> send<00:02:12.280> over<00:02:12.549> your

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
could theoretically send over your

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.330 
could theoretically send over your
address<00:02:13.150> city<00:02:13.390> state<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.840> zip<00:02:14.049> code<00:02:14.260> field<00:02:14.709> so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
address city state and zip code field so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.890 
address city state and zip code field so
that<00:02:15.370> way<00:02:15.760> it's<00:02:15.909> looking<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.450> match<00:02:16.629> from

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
that way it's looking for a match from

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
that way it's looking for a match from
all<00:02:17.140> four

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
all four

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.510 
all four
fields<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.800> purposes<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
fields but for the purposes of this

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.670 
fields but for the purposes of this
tutorial<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:21.209> are<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.019> search<00:02:22.319> one

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
tutorial we are just going to search one

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.089 
tutorial we are just going to search one
field<00:02:22.980> which<00:02:23.129> is<00:02:23.250> our<00:02:23.370> company<00:02:23.970> field<00:02:24.239> and

we can do to clean up that data we could

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.840 
we can do to clean up that data we could
either<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.410> back<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.889> original<00:03:31.980> table<00:03:32.639> or

either go back to the original table or

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.559 
either go back to the original table or
we<00:03:33.299> can<00:03:33.480> delete<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.139> these<00:03:34.380> records<00:03:34.650> here

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
we can delete one of these records here

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.879 
we can delete one of these records here
but<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.870> little<00:03:36.989> warning<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.560> wouldn't<00:03:37.799> go

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
but just a little warning I wouldn't go

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.129 
but just a little warning I wouldn't go
deleting<00:03:38.430> anything<00:03:38.670> because<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:39.630> might<00:03:39.870> have

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
deleting anything because we might have

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.009 
deleting anything because we might have
some<00:03:40.620> orders<00:03:41.160> based<00:03:41.459> off<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.790> one<00:03:42.269> customer<00:03:42.810> ID

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
but not off of another so you might want

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.660 
but not off of another so you might want

sure that that hasn't been separated out

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.229 
sure that that hasn't been separated out
