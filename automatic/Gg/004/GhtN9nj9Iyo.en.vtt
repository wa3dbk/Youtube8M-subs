that<00:00:44.910> there's<00:00:45.480> no<00:00:45.629> real<00:00:45.809> reason<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.440> now

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that there's no real reason for it now

that there's no real reason for it now
he<00:00:46.890> does<00:00:47.070> take<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:47.579> mortars<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> fact

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
he does take out two mortars and in fact

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
he does take out two mortars and in fact
he<00:00:48.750> starts<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.920> last<00:00:50.489> mortar

here<00:00:51.270> which<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> important<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.039> guess<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
here which is important I guess for the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
here which is important I guess for the
attack<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.090> using<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.960> many<00:00:55.110> lightning

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
attack but using that many lightning

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.470 
attack but using that many lightning
spells<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.340> you're<00:00:56.460> attacking<00:00:56.910> such<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> low

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
spells when you're attacking such a low

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
spells when you're attacking such a low
base<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.989> such<00:00:58.199> high<00:00:58.410> troops<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> really

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
base with such high troops is really

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.950 
base with such high troops is really
questionable<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.210> mean<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> could<00:01:00.780> definitely

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
questionable I mean you could definitely

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
questionable I mean you could definitely
do<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.770> rages<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.370> heels<00:01:02.579> or

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
do this with just rages or heels or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
do this with just rages or heels or
dragons<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> mean<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> could<00:01:04.260> destroy<00:01:04.530> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
dragons or I mean you could destroy this

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.530 
dragons or I mean you could destroy this
base<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.070> anything<00:01:05.549> especially<00:01:06.390> when

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
base with anything especially when

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.539

you're<00:01:06.659> using<00:01:06.810> max<00:01:07.140> troops<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.369> some

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you're using max troops but for some

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.250 
you're using max troops but for some
reason<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.000> guy's<00:01:09.210> decided<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> pick<00:01:10.080> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
really mind-blowing to me but I we're

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.670 
really mind-blowing to me but I we're
not<00:02:12.810> sure<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
not sure of it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.199 
not sure of it
or<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.010> he<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.159> just<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.459> bad<00:02:14.579> attacker<00:02:14.939> but

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
or if he was just a bad attacker but

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.729 
or if he was just a bad attacker but
judging<00:02:15.540> from<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:15.900> he<00:02:16.049> used<00:02:16.200> his<00:02:16.349> heroes

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
judging from the way he used his heroes

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.170 
judging from the way he used his heroes
and<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.069> lightning<00:02:17.400> spells<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.819> everything

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and the lightning spells and everything

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.059 
and the lightning spells and everything
we<00:02:18.599> can<00:02:18.720> assume<00:02:19.049> he's<00:02:19.230> probably<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.980> bad

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
we can assume he's probably just a bad

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.550 
we can assume he's probably just a bad
attacker<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.060> again<00:02:21.659> no<00:02:21.810> disrespect<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.379> this
