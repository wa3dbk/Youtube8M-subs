it's<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.480> very<00:01:52.510> vog<00:01:52.930> Marion<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.920> sense<00:01:54.220> and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
it's a very vog Marion in that sense and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's a very vog Marion in that sense and
it's<00:01:54.610> epic<00:01:54.850> in<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.210> scope<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.370> it's<00:01:57.370> very

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it's epic in the scope and it's very

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's epic in the scope and it's very
immersive<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.180> there's<00:01:58.330> things<00:01:58.479> going<00:01:58.540> on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
immersive and there's things going on

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.200 
immersive and there's things going on
you<00:01:59.470> know<00:01:59.560> all<00:02:00.040> over<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.640> place<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.150> think

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
you know all over the place and I think

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.910 
you know all over the place and I think
that's<00:02:01.570> something<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.870> is<00:02:02.170> very<00:02:02.620> hard<00:02:02.860> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that's something that is very hard to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.590 
that's something that is very hard to
capture<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.400> paper<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.940> then<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.330> course<00:02:04.390> they

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
capture on paper and then of course they

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.240 
capture on paper and then of course they
have<00:02:04.720> got<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.900> great<00:02:05.200> score<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.800> music<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.130> all

have got a great score and music and all

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.069 
have got a great score and music and all

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
that stuff and pyrotechnics this is all

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.749 
that stuff and pyrotechnics this is all
the<00:02:08.139> stuff<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.319> can't<00:02:08.649> draw<00:02:08.889> so<00:02:09.249> in<00:02:09.489> that

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
the stuff you can't draw so in that

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.949 
the stuff you can't draw so in that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.729 
life is something that hasn't been done
with<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.269> character<00:03:10.629> in<00:03:10.780> 70<00:03:11.290> some<00:03:11.620> odd<00:03:11.680> years

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
with this character in 70 some odd years

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.789 
with this character in 70 some odd years
so<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.090> think<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.390> upside<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.959> showing<00:03:14.379> the

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
so I think the upside is showing the

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.770 
so I think the upside is showing the
world<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.340> whole<00:03:15.549> different<00:03:16.030> side<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.239> Batman

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
world a whole different side of Batman

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.900 
world a whole different side of Batman

everything<00:04:07.299> that<00:04:07.419> Batman<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.859> without

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
everything that Batman is without

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.800 
everything that Batman is without
excluding<00:04:09.370> anybody<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.819> said<00:04:10.120> I'm<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.329> Batman

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
excluding anybody I said I'm a Batman

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.990 
excluding anybody I said I'm a Batman
because<00:04:11.199> he's<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.709> superhero<00:04:12.190> with<00:04:12.370> no<00:04:12.489> powers

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
because he's a superhero with no powers

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.479 
because he's a superhero with no powers
and<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.230> know<00:04:14.319> in<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.620> sense<00:04:14.829> he's<00:04:15.099> the

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
and and you know in that sense he's the

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.939 
and and you know in that sense he's the
the<00:04:15.790> ultimate<00:04:16.320> aspirational<00:04:17.320> character<00:04:17.680> and

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
the ultimate aspirational character and

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.060 
the ultimate aspirational character and
I<00:04:18.430> think<00:04:18.760> when<00:04:19.599> you<00:04:19.690> talk<00:04:19.870> about<00:04:19.930> doing<00:04:20.739> stage

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
I think when you talk about doing stage

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.800 
I think when you talk about doing stage
show<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.489> showcases<00:04:21.969> what<00:04:22.240> superheroes

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
show that showcases what superheroes

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.560 
show that showcases what superheroes
would<00:04:23.530> look<00:04:23.710> like<00:04:23.919> in<00:04:24.130> real<00:04:24.190> life

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
would look like in real life

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.120 
would look like in real life
I've<00:04:25.810> seen<00:04:26.110> plenty<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.410> them<00:04:26.530> at<00:04:26.680> conventions

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
I've seen plenty of them at conventions

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.410 
I've seen plenty of them at conventions
but<00:04:27.280> I've<00:04:27.370> never<00:04:27.460> seen<00:04:27.730> them<00:04:27.850> dropping<00:04:28.270> from

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
but I've never seen them dropping from

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.450 
but I've never seen them dropping from
the<00:04:28.540> ceilings<00:04:28.960> down<00:04:29.140> at<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> think

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
the ceilings down at you and so I think

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820 
the ceilings down at you and so I think
that<00:04:30.820> sense<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.480> this<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.560> ultimate

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that sense this is this is the ultimate

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.920 
that sense this is this is the ultimate
realization<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:33.670> fantasy<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.480> yeah<00:04:34.750> he's

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
realization of that fantasy so yeah he's

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.890 
realization of that fantasy so yeah he's
a<00:04:34.960> fantastic<00:04:35.350> character<00:04:35.590> but<00:04:36.130> we<00:04:36.490> had<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.900> to

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
a fantastic character but we had to to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.480 
a fantastic character but we had to to
find<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.470> know<00:04:38.620> something<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.370> would<00:04:39.430> work

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
find you know something that would work

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.850 
find you know something that would work
in<00:04:39.820> an<00:04:40.090> arena<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:41.110> think<00:04:41.560> we've<00:04:41.650> done<00:04:41.800> that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
in an arena and I think we've done that

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.250 
in an arena and I think we've done that
as<00:04:42.130> we<00:04:42.460> said<00:04:42.640> there's<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.480> spectacular

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
as we said there's the spectacular

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.020
