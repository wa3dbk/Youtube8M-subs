00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.570 

now<00:00:01.969> why<00:00:02.449> am<00:00:02.480> I<00:00:02.689> such<00:00:02.990> a<00:00:03.020> big<00:00:03.350> fan<00:00:03.530> of<00:00:03.560> kelp<00:00:03.919> well

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
now why am I such a big fan of kelp well

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.710 
now why am I such a big fan of kelp well
there's<00:00:04.939> quite<00:00:05.210> a<00:00:05.240> few<00:00:05.330> different<00:00:05.689> reasons

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
there's quite a few different reasons

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.860 
there's quite a few different reasons
first<00:00:06.349> of<00:00:06.500> all<00:00:06.649> kelp<00:00:07.279> is<00:00:07.490> a<00:00:07.550> sea<00:00:07.729> vegetable<00:00:08.690> and

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
first of all kelp is a sea vegetable and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.259 
first of all kelp is a sea vegetable and
that<00:00:09.200> means<00:00:09.320> it's<00:00:09.559> a<00:00:09.740> wild<00:00:10.280> food<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:10.969> most<00:00:11.179> of

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
that means it's a wild food so most of

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.569 
that means it's a wild food so most of
us<00:00:11.389> we<00:00:11.540> pretty<00:00:12.259> much<00:00:12.349> know<00:00:12.679> wild<00:00:13.009> food<00:00:13.160> we<00:00:13.339> only

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:13.579 
us we pretty much know wild food we only

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.380 
us we pretty much know wild food we only
cultivated<00:00:14.150> food<00:00:14.629> and<00:00:14.900> that<00:00:14.990> means<00:00:15.200> that<00:00:15.499> the

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
cultivated food and that means that the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.550 
cultivated food and that means that the
spectrum<00:00:17.390> of<00:00:17.450> nutrients<00:00:17.930> available<00:00:18.020> to<00:00:18.380> us<00:00:18.440> is

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
spectrum of nutrients available to us is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.870 
spectrum of nutrients available to us is
very<00:00:18.740> limited<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.340> that's<00:00:19.520> often<00:00:19.790> where

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
very limited and that's often where

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.970 
very limited and that's often where
deficiencies<00:00:20.450> show<00:00:20.660> up<00:00:20.810> so<00:00:21.230> kelp<00:00:21.560> didn't<00:00:21.860> have

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
deficiencies show up so kelp didn't have

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.410 
deficiencies show up so kelp didn't have
that<00:00:22.130> problem<00:00:22.310> because<00:00:22.520> it<00:00:22.580> grows<00:00:22.670> wild<00:00:23.090> in

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
that problem because it grows wild in

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.870 
that problem because it grows wild in
the<00:00:23.540> sea<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.380> got<00:00:24.500> all<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:25.250> goodness<00:00:25.550> in

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
the sea so it's got all that goodness in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.510 
the sea so it's got all that goodness in
it<00:00:25.970> now<00:00:26.420> out<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:27.110> all<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.860> sea<00:00:28.040> vegetables

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
it now out of all the sea vegetables

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.090 
it now out of all the sea vegetables
kelp<00:00:28.940> is<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.600> most<00:00:30.200> nutritionally<00:00:30.920> dense

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
kelp is the most nutritionally dense

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.700 
kelp is the most nutritionally dense
it's<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.610> most<00:00:32.029> powerful<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.899> at<00:00:33.499> the<00:00:33.589> same

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
it's the most powerful and at the same

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.410 
it's the most powerful and at the same
time<00:00:33.920> wonderfully<00:00:34.699> it's<00:00:34.910> also<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.390> most

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
time wonderfully it's also the most

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.209 
time wonderfully it's also the most
cost-effective<00:00:36.019> it's<00:00:36.620> also<00:00:36.739> pretty<00:00:36.920> much<00:00:37.100> the

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
cost-effective it's also pretty much the

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.689 
cost-effective it's also pretty much the
cheapest<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:37.850> best<00:00:38.510> of<00:00:38.690> both<00:00:38.899> worlds<00:00:39.550> helps<00:00:40.550> do

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
cheapest so best of both worlds helps do

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.180 
cheapest so best of both worlds helps do
vary<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.269> lot<00:00:41.629> in<00:00:41.780> quality<00:00:42.199> I've<00:00:42.649> chosen<00:00:43.010> this

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
vary a lot in quality I've chosen this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.439 
vary a lot in quality I've chosen this
one<00:00:43.370> specifically<00:00:43.789> because<00:00:43.969> as<00:00:44.149> well<00:00:44.300> as

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
one specifically because as well as

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.160 
one specifically because as well as
being<00:00:44.600> cost-effective<00:00:44.949> it's<00:00:45.949> also<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:47.170> very

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
being cost-effective it's also a very

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.259 
being cost-effective it's also a very
very<00:00:48.620> good<00:00:49.010> taste<00:00:49.309> because<00:00:50.059> you<00:00:50.179> know

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
very good taste because you know

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.430 
very good taste because you know
sometimes<00:00:50.480> they<00:00:50.719> can<00:00:50.780> taste<00:00:51.109> a<00:00:51.199> little<00:00:51.289> bit

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
sometimes they can taste a little bit

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.020 
sometimes they can taste a little bit
fishy<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.769> bit<00:00:51.920> unpleasant<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:52.640> one's<00:00:52.819> kind

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
fishy a bit unpleasant this one's kind

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.309 
fishy a bit unpleasant this one's kind
of<00:00:53.059> lemony<00:00:53.479> and<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.629> little<00:00:53.839> bit<00:00:53.899> salt<00:00:54.170> is

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
of lemony and a little bit salt is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.200 
of lemony and a little bit salt is
really<00:00:54.859> nice<00:00:54.979> and<00:00:55.339> of<00:00:55.429> course<00:00:55.460> it's<00:00:55.699> organic

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
really nice and of course it's organic

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.790 
really nice and of course it's organic

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
as well what that means is it's

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.099 
as well what that means is it's
cultivating<00:00:58.370> away<00:00:58.639> which<00:00:58.909> is<00:00:59.179> you<00:00:59.629> know<00:00:59.659> in<00:00:59.929> a

that's good for the environment as well

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.709 
that's good for the environment as well
you<00:01:04.339> know<00:01:04.400> they<00:01:04.549> don't<00:01:04.670> over<00:01:05.030> harvest<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.570> all

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
you know they don't over harvest it all

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.060

of kelp but if you have hypothyroidism

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.270 
of kelp but if you have hypothyroidism
which<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.229> by<00:01:36.350> far<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.649> most<00:01:36.829> common<00:01:36.950> one

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
which is by far the most common one

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.789 
which is by far the most common one
which<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.939> obvious<00:01:38.780> common<00:01:39.170> signs<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.590> are

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
which the obvious common signs that are

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.719 
which the obvious common signs that are
low<00:01:40.250> immunity<00:01:40.899> or<00:01:41.899> low<00:01:42.469> metabolism<00:01:43.070> so

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
low immunity or low metabolism so
