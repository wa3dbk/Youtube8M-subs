00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.600
 it's called the party I have extra years 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.930
 and I'm from Gurabo, I 'm running from the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.930
 13 and I started the damage with 17 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:55.130
 I'm 28 years old and well I consider this 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.260
 extremely extreme sport a highly sport 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.059
 extreme because since one is catching 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.340
 a lot of speed what he had ridden in 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.080
 a table and four wheels and you have to 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.470
 know how to handle it very well so as not to fall 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.470
 at that speed 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.610
 can no longer 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 well I four months practicing for 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.330
 this competition and the routines that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.300
 I practiced were on different slopes 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.729
 that being spontaneous did not have like 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.660
 that an exact routine for the downhill 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.330
 because more read the runners inside 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.820
 of the race but for the slide and if 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.070
 had the good fortune to do a routine and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.580
 well be able to do it well in the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.580
 competition 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.819
 they are winners good conduct discipline 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.220
 a lot of practice and desire to win that 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.460
 desire to be the first place in going down 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.960
 the slope 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 it's pretty good to compete this year 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 we compete 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.830
 it's a family and here everyone 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.160
 competes everything is not known two worlds 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.160
 friends 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.360
 in the future media catching a lot 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.360
 arriving 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.150
 they are making more giant people 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.150
 as well 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.050
 my goals for the future are that the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.730
 sport grow much more on the island and 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.100
 Take the sport to the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.810
 youth so that they leave the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.810
 streets be quiet of the world 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.950
 in the soul 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.950
 and 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.230
 and
