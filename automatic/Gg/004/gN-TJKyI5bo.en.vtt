 geo geo geo group friends of the toc toc toc thorup xd 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.070
 I bring you some tricks for novices and steers like me xd for windows 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.489
 Well the first one is how to open folders or programs with just one 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.819
 click ok will go to start later to control panel 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.419
 and now the folder options and we execute it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.460
 you can close the control panel 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 and it will open a window like this now they go to the option that says 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.470
 general 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.240
 now where it says a single click to open item chooses in that option and it 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.180
 mark this option this will put a line that highlights the names in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.960
 the programs so that he does not do that we give him 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.180
 click here that is to be highlighted but only when we put the pointer 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.750
 on the icon of the program or folder in order already give in to apply if accept and ready 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.650
 they will open only with a click 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.560
 yao cri second is that windows does not save the configurations when shutting down 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.150
 or restart the pc 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.430
 when we leave windows it normally saves the desktop configuration 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.350
 that is, where the appearance icons and other parameters are located 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.370
 if you want that even if a change is made in the windows desktop and not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.610
 you want these to be saved for future sessions we will have to deactivate 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.259
 self-care and for this we have the following trick we are going to start 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.830
 after executing and writing the command re jerez dick 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.520
 we look for the key 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 what is your being 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 after software 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 then malik the eyes 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 after windows 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.580
 then curren version 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120
 after policemen 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.839
 and finally in explorer 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.529
 one click eye on the crosses these 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:18.389
 Okay we have right click on a blank site and create a new value 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.629
 dword posse adam click who the word 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.139
 and a pod will open like this one 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.529
 now they write this name you do not know the think 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:30.159
 I do not do it because I already did it so the only thing I could do is 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.529
 modify it or modify it and we already had it 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.310
 well done they are going to right click on the new file and they give without 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:42.930
 modify this window will open the value will be at zero just put the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.559
 1 and already here we leave it like this and finally accept 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.249
 now we just have to restart the pc 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.790
 if we wanted to go back to the previous state we should just avoid it again 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.249
 he does not know if he thinks 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.829
 and give it the value zero 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.879
 and third parties to know if the copy of your windows xp that you have installed on your pc 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.959

 will show you a screen that will indicate that you indo us xp already 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.309
 found activated 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.479
 if it is not activated it will show you another screen where you write 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:34.009

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.159
 Windows Xp 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.409
 if the copy you have installed is pirated and starts the first letter by d 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.870
 for example then do not bother checking the activation because it is not 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.789
