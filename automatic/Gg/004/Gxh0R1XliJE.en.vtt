00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.110
 and there is a comparison is always that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.269
 I make compaq change neither line 11 of 500 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 comparative drug is essential for 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.590
 what is not good here is just 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.109
 to talk about advantages and disadvantages of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.260
 each positive point no line 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.560
 another okay're so good at following 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.470
 fashion with an equivalent price but with the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.710
 way I'm mainly talking and 500 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:42.719
 old and ninja 250r 500 new cb 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 500 f and neither represents nor via 300 is a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 little cheaper than sp 500 is new 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.550
 is actually lead line 300 and two 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.500
 is safe for anyone who wants to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 law is nothing more 500 is much more 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.350
 the final speed which is what 90 or I know 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.810
 how many percentage percent do you 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 think that's what matters in the motorcycle 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.640
 final speed loses a lot of energy 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.229
 for new fifth does not lose a lot to not 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.930
 and new platelets 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.680
 so if you take into consideration 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 kiss 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:35.460
 the touch I will know information about 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.950
 Nobody's real bearing 350 but it's more 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.770
 weak touch on cb 500 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.729
 if you like torque and do not 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.440
 necessarily the final speed is 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.770
 Whatever farm has more comfort hurts. 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.770
 for the pilot 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.380
 every bike that is not fairing is more 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.610
 comfortable that the fairing bike is the case 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.610
 line the same thing 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:15.620
 uses to fail the voice is not this bought a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 new notebook friend there on a bread or 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.880
 My, my braga will pay almost 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.030
 I financed it but it's for you passed law 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.590
 What 's even leaving you guys? 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.890
 try to change the program that I was 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.190
 using editing will make a boat and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.190
 over there 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:48.070
 - I continue the saga or vineyard is a 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.840
 Very good bike however not so comfortable 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:57.260
 for pilot and croup to live well 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.870
 I live near the seaside because the Navy 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.330
 can be a very comfortable bike is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.420
 hot is already better it absorbs better 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.630
 the holes 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.940
 that tire is there 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.940
 before I cut aluminum 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.670
 Hmm 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.290
 What happens is that you supply cups either 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.560
 you every day, right? 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.860
 I listen to the listener today and mark the day of 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.860
 school 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.380
 not only does it not paralyze there what in 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.960
 and hit the bike better for the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.020
 virus that is more expensive and nothing more than 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.130
 nothing is fairing and 500 is more 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.660
 comfortable to travel because the place and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.340
 is not that to say that he hopes to have 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.380
 tanned there 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.530
 It is 9 o'clock by the side of the path to the hot 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.530
 1 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.750
 rodolfo knocked and went to bed here is this 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.750
 my 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:42.330
 it is not imperative to be comparative tanned 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.090
 I expect from the cp 500 line that the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.690
 From this purchase of the notebook it is 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.690
 you 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.430
 I'm not only going to use to edit the videos 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.110
 youtube and vimeo get you 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:03.290
 is not a top of the top five 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.290
 romazzini or smooth the ship 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.130
 Heroes are only 2 to 10 3 15 60 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.130
 front 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.380
 we started using the 60 countries 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.660
 You're there Comes this new kind of new 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.760
 will work will run cool will give 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.150
 For legal weeks. 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.030
 it's more like having a reason to open 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.790
 He's already recording for you, there he is. 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:47.780
 always ahead of you tell me 5 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:51.250
 of the difference other than the camera 11 friends 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.250
 now it goes 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:07.560
 but you 'll be mad in the afternoon zone 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:10.639
 I just do not know yet and will now turn to 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.639
 look at mine 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:22.460
 47 final word goals we have 40 seconds 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.460
 of ideas spoken so it's better to 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.310
 You go there with me and I think 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.730
 be good at 60 frames to it as it speaks 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.250
 that you found and I do not know either 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.050
 I do not know if it's better or worse but I know 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.850
 here it is heavier to work 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.660
 and I said do not know if the notebook will give 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.630
 account 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.080
 If I go I will record 80 prizes and if you 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.000
 Like it or not, I will not let it. 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.600
 right there and continue the way you 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.460
 okay beauty that's there to contribute 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.770
 the pac goes to whoever says it is a little more 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.770
 comfortable a little more expensive 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.479
 the guard also does not 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.569
 is 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.840
 won 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.620
 especially here where there is a 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.699
 walk allergy more into account than the 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.699
 500 canada 

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:37.860
 and the photo will accompany the saga not to the 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.860
 zaga only fell I liked the most
