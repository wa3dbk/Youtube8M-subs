00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.530
 is when the videos have many visits are 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 it has a certain relevance 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.520
 sometimes it does not have to be that 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.139
 but if you look 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.429
 sometimes it comes out as an advertisement on top of the bar 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.429
 we lived browsing 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.239
 that puts you 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.009
 the song a link to the song in has said the ones that are listening 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.949
 that is if I put the song x 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.779
 and that today you want to buy this song 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.700
 click here and it takes there we had 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.960
 and good he somehow 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 p is an agreement that they have for you 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.490
 you motivate yourself to buy that song 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.830
 it's a model 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.370
 of de negocis not for example that's why 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 like the radios before you hear what the musicians wanted and 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.120
 and the people the producers that you heard abr 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.330
 if we listened to the radio 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.460
 percent was very difficult 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.970
 by age the discs were made little if it was a really way to reach the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.230
 great masses of urbanism - now there are other ways 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.570
 and there your for example is 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.770
 I believe that nowadays it is the store that sells more 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 more good album plus his music 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.400
 of the united states usa 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.910
 to a question 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.670
 about this theme 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 we already know what 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 was that they give you the micro that we have for that 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.080
 everything well things that are 100 points and also if it could 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.020
 created in the script and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.770
 music if you do not have on your own computer 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.649
 so here put him in his house in the club the mustache 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 the music what happens that what I would have to do is the following 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.810
 we have to win or win 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.380
 but not for those wounded stars that is the specialty makes 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.500
 what I would do is this tool that is said is that then 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.580
 it's worth recording 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 all movements of the screen 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.100
 I would take 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.489
 look and you have written you would create my account 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.519
 I would have it and prepared it 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.639
 would open and paul collins 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.989
 prepared 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.989
 once I open the dread when you should 500 tents work 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.569
 for lopez summer 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.569
 vega thanks 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.289
 then for a hundred 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.069
 there I would record 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.760
 everything on the screen of the dread context would generate us a video 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.670
 we would have to download that video to our hard disk 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.889
 and from there upload it to youtube or 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.449
 and put the music is not impossible but for that 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.849
 pal second workshop I believe nothing 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.239
 already for the advanced level 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.479
 because it's too much but you could do it 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.649
 Without a doubt 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.879
 in fact 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.699
 it's the milkmaid 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.589
 despite that since said before the presentations 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.399
 you can put audio too 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.699
 and you can in to see videos 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:09.789
 the truth is that they are some tools the uncertain quito oct 'feli' to see &amp; 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.229
 white what we will see now and six bikes are the tools 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.179
 that you have to start to dominate 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:18.999
 any other question
