00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello everybody , welcome, it's another video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.780
 here my channel and this one I 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.610
 I was able to solve a problem that I 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.199
 I was getting a little annoying and usually 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:25.490
 consumption happens these engines here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.380
 gm special explains that eight flights 2.0 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.219
 where he was with the following defect 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.320
 he had already been changed the candles of the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.879
 spark plug wires 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.710
 but it still had a defect 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.129
 that when you accelerated low 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.800
 rotation in gaza of water and also in the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.199
 approximately 2,500 turns and also 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 I was giving in gaza something that called me 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.770
 the attention in this one to have done here only this 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.059
 happened when it warmed 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.739
 usually when he warmed up 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.909
 was starting to fail 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 give a few slings in the engine, right? 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 presenting their failures and what I 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.409
 I deduced because I had you 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250
 done only when heated image will be 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.869
 coil 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.000
 So what I did can see that from here 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.610
 up to 1 a wire here tied up right I 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.700
 I had access to this coil the old coil 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.619
 I was downstairs just to doubt 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 win the reel 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.229
 I did this temporary installation and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 actually the defect was found here 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.149
 chevrolet engine is interesting coil 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.329
 is that if you did external test bug 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.189
 the traditional test off the engine 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.549
 cable floor 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.409
 then came the spark sparking eff you 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.009
 would see this in the 424 rich here today 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.270
 supply the sail cables 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.780
 So you're going through this. 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.459
 problem usually the astra the vectra is the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.940
 mountain 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.530
 they use this same engine here and even 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.099
 even on older engines in vectra 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.700
 99 right 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:32.269
 the cadet 97 so you may distrust 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.760
 the coil ne 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.519
 for example if you already changed the candles 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.299
 the candle cables and it runs persists 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.000
 choke and what if this happens when 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.200
 he is then warmed to 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.060
 very high probability of being coil 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.580
 This is the second chevrolet engine that 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.590
 I let go of it and sometimes 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.500
 people think it's beak gun us 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.500
 thinks of so many things that can be 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.540
 happening but they really are not right 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.480
 when the car straight to ruin it 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.299
 shows the constant defect when a 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 candle spoils now also when he 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.720
 it is cold and only when it 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.799
 was defective 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.250
 probably the coil and usually 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.590
 when you force on the engine as the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.350
 too much motor momentum in the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.060
 pluck what was happening here 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.600
 gagged and when he engaged a third 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.209
 and accelerated either was forced between 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.690
 2,500 to 3,000 turns he was giving a 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:44.470
 failure was choked beauty then 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:48.200
 solved here plus a coil situation 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.130
 can be sure and another symptom 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.310
 also coil when it warms up 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.780
 is defective and a cut in the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.329
 voltage 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.519
 this cut is visible you feel the lights 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.639
 of the panel weakening when it gives 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.590
 a dash of dashboard laughter 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.319
 weakens because it has entered into friction 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.709
 with the car voltage at that time 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.250
 it is a peak and at the moment that what 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.250
 raises the peak the current tends to 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.980
 from there you feel up to the headlights of the car 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.130
 also blinking giving a missed as 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.070
 if they were weak and strong 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.930
 precisely at a time when the engine 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.810
 chokes or is having conflict 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.890
 resulting in the coil why this 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.740
 happens 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.180
 Personal beauty then is this video this 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.230
 tip for you 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.930
 now I'm going to finish the video I'm going 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.360
 take this gambiarra here 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:53.500
 there is the part correctly also the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.930
 care of you for this video on 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:02.680
 the coils that surround the motor 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:09.860
 this engine here they have the same format 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:12.350
 can not see in the old iron is 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.660
 much cheaper you can buy a part 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.930
 original you can have a fortune both in 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.270
 west of time and stay with the car 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.880
 but when you are putting you 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.370
 faced difficulty on the corner of 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.250
 installation on diagram knots on numbers 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:33.530
 in the case here and if the motor coil 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:39.250
 2009 2005 onwards then it is who is 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:42.919
 different I see it is a 3 2 and 1 4 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:48.350
 but if you get that same 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:51.979
 coil same format of the year 2003 by 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:57.590
 example and you know that the numbering 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:06:01.220
 put 1 2 3 and 4 in the numbering here I came 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:05.479
 it's the diagram it will not work 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.390
 correct to follow the original diagram by 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:12.970
 example in 2003 it may be that 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.090
 two are 4 and your engine is the 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.650
 2009 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.290
 So you have to call according to the 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:22.010
 diagram of the original part or where 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:26.430
 is the 2 will put an angel 3 you will 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.500
 put the correct 4 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.770
 that's it because this mayor 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.060
 happens a coil is the natural wear 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.280
 of the piece and also a time shock to the 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.650
 times and stopped in the puddle right 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.490
 It is not recommended without a pool guy 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.400
 water engine hot water cold water 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.850
 below the coil of a thermal shock 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:54.690
 this happens and this presents these 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.790
 variation in operation and detail 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.850
 kind of problem here is complicated 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.820
 Why do you pass the tek? 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:07.050
 system diagnostic machine and not 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:10.080
 accuses nothing to the yellow lights of 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.660
 indicative of problems in the 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.360
 electronic management also do not light 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.610
 then this problem really it breaks 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:23.250
 head of many people right then 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:26.520
 summing up the engine starts to fail when 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.040
 warm you see them already changed the cable 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.980
 of candle and candle but the 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.560
 problem of choking and this problem 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.510
 only after it heats up 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.460
 so you'll probably try to remember 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:42.150
 of old cars and when the coil 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.920
 he did not catch this problem of 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.200
 coil to date does not happen in the case 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.950
 this house here when they tried 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.610
 put on until it worked more 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:55.380
 choking failure failing to force 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:08:01.370
 Beauty you like the video click 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.370
 I liked it and that's it until the next
