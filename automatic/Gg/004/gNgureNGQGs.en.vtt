00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.290
 even though 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.030
 Hello, you speak to 58, I have them very 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.230
 abandoned today I bring you two we could 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 say the tricks here in the laboratory 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.140
 of light management as you can see 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.630
 I'm with slayer and I'm with tenth 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 cousin who are two of my companions 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.090
 plate game ops 2 and we're going to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.400
 show you the tricks first that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.620
 we are all walking to each business 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.940
 fixedly to the barrier there is a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.520
 invisible barrier where you can 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.410
 walk and you can not fall as before 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.560
 that supposedly is the patch that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 they put it before one will stay there 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.640
 in the good trick now one can 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.940
 go up there as you can see what is going to put 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.580
 in a bird chamber there you can see that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800
 I fall this trick is not more than everything 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.080
 like to stay there doing rounds 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.079
 because it is not possible to grab what 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.329
 release the shoulders 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.399
 so it would be nothing more than a trick 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.080
 although you can stay there sometimes 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.820
 touches the zombies hit you very rarely 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.830
 they touch you but well more than anything let's say 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.840
 which is a trick to leave the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 last and go to sleep if you're 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.860
 in a meeting we could do it like this 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 and there we can see they are good 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.370
 and back because we're watching 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.320
 they stay zombie 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.320
 I do not touch good, it was yesterday 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.799
 and is going to try to put the trick 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.799
 let's see if you can 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.280
 let's focus yesterday the black one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.280
 greeting 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.340
 well then let's do it more 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.420
 quick out teach them I 'm going to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.659
 come back when I fall 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.540
 and I threw water this trick and I think that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.729
 everyone knows it but I am going to review them now 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.560
 in my first video two comfortable vienna and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.560
 they start to fall in front of the sport 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.320
 and where can be tip we are going to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.060
 drop the zombies there are under the tenth 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.460
 good cousin I hope you liked it 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.460
 this after uploading I will be uploading 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.930
 more is the first of white 2 that I'm going to 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.500
 go up and it's going to be going up a lot a lot 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.280
 much more 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.280
 bye bye
