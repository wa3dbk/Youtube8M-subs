 let's talk about what are the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 departments are talking about it being 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.580
 they are going to add new 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.530
 departments leave new categories of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 them including new designs of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.370
 interiors let's try to forget that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 theme of what monotonous designs are 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.460
 of the departments more or less of the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.960
 same category goes out to see the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850
 possibility of new designs of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 interiors with this part of adding 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 new departments will likewise see 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.150
 the possibility of being able to acquire more than 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 one simultaneously goes out to know the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.910
 moment that we have a department 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 in grand theft auto we bought one 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.540
 different the first one we had was 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 Take off, we lose it as such 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 just out there like that you can 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.270
 to say that pays is the amount that is worth 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.009
 your previous department to be able 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.780
 buy a new one however we can not 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.430
 have more than one at a time this part is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.960
 add from this day Tuesday to 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.940
 read have the possibility of being able to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.100
 be able to acquire more than 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.110
 two departments leave no amount 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 exact however if there was talk about 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.190
 more than two of them comes out after the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.960
 departments should also add what 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.850
 which are four new sales vehicles 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.369
 they throw three cars and a motorcycle 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.190
 would be one of the category of what 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.200
 would be the vehicles of the vehicles 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.570
 these unitary sports vehicles 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.580
 the sv which would be the home plate s 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.110
 we also have a sports car which 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480
 it would be the most sacred 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.160
 the super which would be the center and the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.380
 motorcycle that mentioned the dim 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.790
 casters which which vehicles 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.380
 will obviously be available for your 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.090
 acquisition through the mobile page 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.530
 in what is the multiplayer and by the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210
 part of the campaign would be added 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.680
 in what are the garages of each one of 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.960
 our characters that we already know 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.760
 comes out with this part also it 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.440
 would add what is out there some 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.330
 detail which is not very clear to me 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.550
 an option for what races are 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.560
 which is called non contact which 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.240
 practically tries to avoid 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.130
 collisions in races that subject and 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.270
 when they play a race with some 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.920
 friends or with some people 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.600
 strangers who are only engaged in 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400
 collide with others as soon as the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.050
 race or what maybe only 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060
 dedicate to take them out of balance take them out 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.890
 of the road and I do not know how to make collisions 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.420
 As such , new ones were added 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.250
 option out there for the races the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.020
 which, as I mentioned, are called 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.790
 a contact which I would try to avoid 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.770
 the collisions would try to avoid these 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.380
 people who try to do only 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.090
 so disorder in what are the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.560
 career and good missions 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.540
 would also be added by the part of 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.340
 the weapons only a single weapon up 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.310
 which would be bull pop 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.110
 ripoll leaves which has a similarity already 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.069
 pretty clear to a gun for those 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.890
 who want for those with 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.659
 like me from the call of duty to what would be 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.010
 the modern warfare 3 for those who 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.719
 remember they know what weapon I am 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.760
 speaking out it has a very similar 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.249
 particular very peculiar out there to the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.329
 attack really and nothing guys that day 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.590
 the new weapon which would be added 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.510
 obviously the store will be available 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.920
 of the ammunition has not fenced there is no 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.780
 information about the cost only 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.069
 which will be available comes out and another 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.659
 important detail which I do not know 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.310
 it caught a lot of attention was going to see a 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.139
 new option or a new feature 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.060
 within the characters which is going to 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.249
 be called mental state in mental 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.749
 stage which is basically going to 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.250
 characterize by the type of player that 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.659
 you are obviously depending on the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.280
 activities that you do you dedicate to 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.019
 kill people you dedicate to steal 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.909
 you dedicate to whatever you are going to have as 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.859
 than a mental state which he is going to 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.359
 indicate to the other players more or 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.739
 less what is it that you are going to do or more or 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.879
 less what is it that he usually does 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.980
 so that the moment someone 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.900
 stranger approaches you in what is the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.000
 online more or less know who is more or 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.859
 the less you know with what intentions 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.380
 it's going to be different 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.599
 mental states depending more or less 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.000
 the previous behavior that you have 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.620
 had to approach that person comes out 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.300
 strip characterizing more or less for your 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.710
 experience and that you carry within the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.160
 game more or less for the activities or 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.380
 for the record you go 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.330
 such guys and also to finalize it 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.730
 would add what are 15 new jobs 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.470
 and also 5 new contacts for the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.700
 obviously, which would give you 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.800
 missions as well as those we already know 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.470
 now as I do not know how they all theory 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.390
 those that are obviously missions 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.320
 We could include about five new 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.150
 they come out five new people 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.130
 unknown which are going to be 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.080
 also giving jobs so that 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.700
 obviously you can generate missions and with 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.900
 this obviously money and such that 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.400
 guys would basically be what we 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.680
 this includes an update comes 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.450
 quite pretty well very complete 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.100
 covers quite a few important things a 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.750
 moment were the things with the only 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.190
 things that were clarified however already 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.080
 we know as soon as the update arrives 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.340
 little details which maybe are not very 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.050
 visible are going to be also 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.490
 obviously adding well in guys from 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.690
 moment is what is here below there 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.460
 just the description is I'm going to leave 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.080
 the official link of the rockstar forums 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.490
 so they see give you a limit a 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.560
 little bit more in detail and all that if you 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.970
 there is some doubt and such would not increase my 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.590
 comment do not forget to tell me what 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.340
 this video seemed mainly what 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.170
 they think about this new 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.910
 update the truth that to me 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.500
 loved not come very very things 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.150
 novelty we hope that within the 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.640
 works within the new 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.650
 activities there are interesting things not 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.009
 I know maybe the issue of banks is the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.919
 topic 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.050
 a little more dangerous banks a little bit 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.789
 forgiveness of theft a little more I do not know that 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.379
 worth more maybe activities 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.939
 little more complicated than it takes something 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.800
 more innovative I think it will be in what 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.509
 We will spend more time so guys this 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.039
 moment I say goodbye a great solito for 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.599
 everyone and nothing remember that I will be 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:54.270
 watching up in a next video of 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.270
 moment happen to very well and goodbye
