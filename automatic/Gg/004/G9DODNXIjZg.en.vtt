00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hi good morning then today I would like to make you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.300
 a video because I did extremely 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.269
 a mixed commission who is in short of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.350
 make a pair of earrings 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.580
 accessories from a girl who marries 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.730
 in short, when I heard it, I trembled in 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.119
 meaning and in short a great one 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.679
 responsibility to accomplish something for 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 for a girl who is getting married e 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.820
 that he will wear right in his grand 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 day what I was asked 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 stop was a pair of earrings that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 among other things this form you already have 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 seen in my previous video on the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.850
 coating of creations on badger 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.910
 so they were a pair of earrings 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.079
 the two are completely white, of course 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.079
 accessories one for belt and one for the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.059
 then bridesmaid headband 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.059
 meanwhile I show you the earrings 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.619
 then these are the earrings that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 they are made it focuses well 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.680
 they are made with modules 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 this is quite simple 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 classic base with crystal a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.840
 smaller drop and this is a test 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.430
 to the slightly larger item 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680
 with this module a little more 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.400
 particular but still easy to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 to achieve 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.479
 and then there are all these crystallines 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.479
 spring onions and this drop in glass 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.369
 mammamia said fire mole oh and and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.220
 these are the earrings at the end 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.320
 we say that the form of earrings and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 was requested by the client 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.000
 made a sketch her by hand to make me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.640
 understand more or less as it would 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.880
 desired and liked them 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.149
 very much and I am very happy because 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.790
 as I repeat, she was a little anxious to 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.009
 this commission on the back are 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 covered with white felt because 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.750
 I had nothing else 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.580
 white and have the hanging open in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:25.540
 followed this girl sent me the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:27.790
 picture of the belt they buy vocal is 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.880
 went the picture of the belt that she 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.180
 wears in her wedding dress and has me 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.080
 asked if I could make a similar one 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.980
 for his daughter who has a dress 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.650
 white with a belt at the waist then the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.690
 belt I realized this there 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.630
 belt that she had in life will come 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.610
 made of various layers we say it was 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.460
 a flower with other small flowers nearby 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.020
 consisting of various layers of various petals 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.460
 of beads 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.460
 then we say that I never was 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.930
 set to do is black lebron 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.090
 all bb the boiler I have no idea either 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.340
 what your name is because this is the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.640
 first time ever that he realizes 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.370
 something in with the beads 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.780
 exclusively with beads the colors 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.920
 of his belt were silver and white 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:32.160
 and therefore I realized this reason 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:35.200
 emerges with a crystal in the center and then 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.450
 since he wanted it a little lengthened 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.190
 added these two half side flowers 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.020
 with these drip crystals or I know you 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.000
 to say the number of beads seems to me that 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.970
 these silver were 11 0 and these 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.700
 I don't remember and sincerely 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.120
 let's say I'm very, very satisfied 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.520
 of work because it was mine 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.040
 first job and black paranoia kissi moss 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.330
 it turned out but I really like it 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.220
 much 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.790
 on the back they have always covered with the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.530
 white filter I didn't do the edging 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.220
 in 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.380
 but as they say brics of lunch but 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.989
 however it is not seen in the sense that it is not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.530
 there is no obstacle between the colors and 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.139
 so then I never had it 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.130
 done so I didn't want to try my hand at 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.250
 something still unknown and I have it 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.320
 showed the bride the girl and her 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.010
 liked it to die he wrote me 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.500
 it even excites me and 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.870
 beautiful me real inter seventh 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.790
 heaven because that is what is very important to me 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.760
 this commission is not a commission 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.950
 to whatever and then this will go 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.430
 applied on the belt of his child 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.620
 in life that I think is the damsel 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.010
 then he asked me if this is the same but 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.870
 I could make something smaller 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.270
 always for his baby for the 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.790
 headband that he would wear and 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.700
 then I realized this module more 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.780
 little one always with the cristal center 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.820
 flower 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.940
 obviously the colors are the same 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.060
 beads are identical identical and these 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.740
 two crystalline ones you now see reflections 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.600
 pink but in reality it is the cover of the 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.500
 cellular or fuchsia than these 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.690
 pink reflections but they are crystals 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.000
 white and also this one liked very much 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.400
 and also I like a lot and I must say 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.039
 that I discovered a technique that me 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.210
 passionate a lot 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.070
 obviously maybe now I will have to 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.440
 experiment try to make gods 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.750
 earrings with 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.720
 with this technique it worries me a little 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.450
 fact that the base under me I have only 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.280
 white to do the en brother and then 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.280
 maybe in nieri earrings like this 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.500
 in short, I do not know I have yet to experiment 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.420
 these two are the things I say 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.240
 they shook more because they didn't 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.360
 having never done them before, I really feared the 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.280
 results however are you satisfied 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.070
 tell me what you think give me some 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.430
 advice if you already work the beads 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.800
 you see some defects because I am 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.110
 new in this technique 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.660
 now just last night but who am I of 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.630
 make them a bracelet that can 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.760
 be paired with these earrings e 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.990
 so I will think to say he thought to accomplish 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:30.350
 a bracelet like this with these two modules 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.380
 central and then a simpler thread of 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.200
 on touch with the side beads though 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.930
 now I have to study it a bit 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.460
 better this is all 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.460
 and thank you hello
