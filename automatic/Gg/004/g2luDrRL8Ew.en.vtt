00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.350 
problems these are actually water marks
which<00:00:47.910> would<00:00:48.239> more<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.719> likely<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:50.360> just

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
which would more than likely just just

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.700

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
wiped right off with the Turgeon I guess

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.930

those<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.010> scratches<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:56.760> just

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
those are not scratches so they're just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
those are not scratches so they're just
water<00:00:57.120> marks<00:00:59.480> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.840> back<00:01:01.050> there's<00:01:01.350> the
