00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.960 

and<00:01:25.990> that's<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:30.550> that's<00:01:31.550> because<00:01:31.850> of

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
and that's because and that's because of

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.640 
and that's because and that's because of
the<00:01:32.060> shape<00:01:32.300> of<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.570> phone<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.140> doesn't<00:01:33.290> go<00:01:33.470> all

the shape of the phone it doesn't go all
the<00:01:33.680> way<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:34.690> if<00:01:35.690> I<00:01:35.780> hit<00:01:35.960> play<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.340> know

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
the way in if I hit play so you know

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.180 
the way in if I hit play so you know
it's<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:41.150> tsunami<00:01:42.140> by<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.530> way<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:45.160> now<00:01:46.160> I

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
it's a tsunami by the way and now I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.490 
it's a tsunami by the way and now I
don't<00:01:46.550> know<00:01:46.760> if<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:46.970> heard<00:01:47.270> if<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:48.050> just<00:01:48.230> turn

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
don't know if you heard if I just turn

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.010 
don't know if you heard if I just turn
you<00:01:48.650> up<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.920> bit

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.889 

but<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.610> phone<00:01:57.000> switching<00:01:57.659> between

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
but that is the phone switching between

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
but that is the phone switching between
the<00:01:58.890> headphone<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> its<00:01:59.790> own<00:01:59.939> speaker

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the headphone and its own speaker

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.320 
the headphone and its own speaker
because<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.920> sure<00:02:02.250> whether<00:02:03.000> it's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
because it is not sure whether it's

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.200 
because it is not sure whether it's
plugged<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
plugged in because that is not all the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.350 
plugged in because that is not all the
way<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.330> if<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.110> take<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:08.179> these<00:02:09.179> are

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
way in if I just take that out these are

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.729 
way in if I just take that out these are
my<00:02:09.450> old<00:02:09.599> pair<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.869> headphones<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.380> had<00:02:10.530> these

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.309 
that's because this video Mecca right
here<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.350> required<00:02:47.920> for<00:02:48.910> both<00:02:49.900> speakers

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
here is not required for both speakers

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.870 
here is not required for both speakers
to<00:02:50.920> get<00:02:51.340> connection<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.209> because<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
to get connection to because the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.400 
to get connection to because the
connection<00:02:55.870> goes<00:02:56.080> through<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:57.010> bit<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:58.410> one

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
connection goes through this bit for one

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.120 
connection goes through this bit for one
of<00:02:59.530> their<00:02:59.620> phones

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
of their phones

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.190 
of their phones
oh<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:00.700> bit<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.209> other<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.720> bit<00:03:02.050> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
oh this bit for the other this bit is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.080 
oh this bit for the other this bit is
just<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> can<00:03:03.340> get<00:03:03.459> into<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> jack

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
just so that it can get into the jack

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.440 
just so that it can get into the jack
whereas<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.510> here<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:08.950> not

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
whereas on here this bit is not

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.390 
whereas on here this bit is not
completely<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:11.200> jack<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.160> know<00:03:12.310> what

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
completely in the jack if you know what

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.580 
completely in the jack if you know what
I<00:03:12.430> mean<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:15.730> you're<00:03:16.360> going<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.660> get<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.140> moto

G<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.600> best<00:03:19.780> idea<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.590> grab<00:03:21.100> a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
G it is a is the best idea to grab a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.400 
G it is a is the best idea to grab a
pair<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.550> headphones<00:03:21.760> without<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.959> microphone

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
pair of headphones without a microphone

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.640 
pair of headphones without a microphone
and<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.830> has<00:03:24.040> two<00:03:24.310> lines<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.440> can

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and that has two lines and if you can

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.140 
and that has two lines and if you can
get<00:03:26.890> them<00:03:27.010> at<00:03:27.100> different<00:03:27.430> distances<00:03:27.819> up<00:03:28.000> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
get them at different distances up and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.910 
get them at different distances up and
down<00:03:28.269> there<00:03:28.450> up<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.080> down<00:03:29.170> Jack<00:03:29.530> I've<00:03:29.769> done

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
down there up and down Jack I've done

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.080 
down there up and down Jack I've done
this<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.220> suppose<00:03:30.340> because<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.790> haven't<00:03:30.970> seen

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
this I suppose because I haven't seen

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.479 
this I suppose because I haven't seen
them<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.390> shop<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:32.440> can<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:33.010> would

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
them in the shop you can I would

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.030 
them in the shop you can I would
definitely<00:03:34.150> recommend<00:03:34.440> getting<00:03:35.440> them

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
definitely recommend getting them

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.600 
definitely recommend getting them
further<00:03:36.370> down<00:03:36.720> because<00:03:37.720> otherwise<00:03:38.610> your

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
further down because otherwise your

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.900 
further down because otherwise your
headphones<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.239> aren't<00:03:40.450> going<00:03:40.569> to<00:03:40.660> work<00:03:41.910> so

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
headphones just aren't going to work so

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
headphones just aren't going to work so
