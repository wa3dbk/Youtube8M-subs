girls are as lucky as me but I want to
do<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.840> have

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
do this for you as well so you can have

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.049 
do this for you as well so you can have
a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.289> bit<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> escapism<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.879> life

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
a little bit of escapism from your life

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
a little bit of escapism from your life
because<00:00:54.449> many<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> probably<00:00:55.289> won't<00:00:55.710> get

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
because many of you probably won't get

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.700 
because many of you probably won't get
engaged<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.789> married<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:57.719> she's<00:00:58.320> awful

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
engaged or married at all she's awful

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
really
so<00:00:59.940> perhaps<00:01:00.149> treat<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so perhaps treat this as a little bit of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
so perhaps treat this as a little bit of
escapism<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> reality<00:01:03.030> TV<00:01:03.510> or

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
escapism this a bit of reality TV or
