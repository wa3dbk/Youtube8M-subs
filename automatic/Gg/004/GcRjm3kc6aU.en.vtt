00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.240
 good hello everyone today we come to talk to you 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.840
 to explain a little trick and 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.779
 basically, many of you 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.650
 you obviously wear jackets or 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.960
 Goretex or waterproof jackets 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.200
 waterproof pants feather garments 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.420
 and you look for how to transport it then 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.570
 you always look for the typical sachet 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.250
 where it is very well adjusted wherever 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.410
 very easy to turn it into a kind of 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.930
 ball and carry yours in your 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.309
 backpack today we are going to make you go to 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.890
 explain how to do it in a very 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.079
 simple is also very comfortable and that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.649
 besides, we do not need more than the 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.179
 own garment to build it and how 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.010
 we will do as good here as 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.950
 you can see we have a jacket 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:59.330
 waterproof we take the sleeve 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:03.470
 we give it a couple of turns and we turn it 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:09.050
 about herself is very easy getting into 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:13.430
 its inside the whole garment and you'll see 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.280
 how this fits perfectly inside and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.500
 we have become a moment for that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.830
 the jacket we had and one of his 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.510
 Sleeves in your own transport bag 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.920
 we can do exactly the same as 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.470
 with rain pants 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.310
 we will take what is the manga of the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.140
 trousers 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 the rule turned a couple of turns for 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.450
 that is well serialized or well closed and 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.290
 we will fix it on itself in agreement and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.320
 we will put in then everything 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.850
 the heel is too big 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.510
 we could have made it smaller 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.910
 leaving her leaving her because that very very 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.280
 compressed obviously we can do what 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.380
 same as a feather jacket is fine 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.680
 simple we would do a little the same 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.740
 operation and we would throw them on itself 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.430
 same agreement it may seem that no 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.110
 between but effectively the garment enters 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.850
 perfectly here in nothing else 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.640
 tricks like these, because that's what 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.490
 serve to put to transport 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.520
 in a comfortable way because your material 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.850
 of agreement is already up to another and we 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.850
 we see
