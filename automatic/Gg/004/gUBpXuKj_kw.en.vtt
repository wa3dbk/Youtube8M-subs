you'll find in the home operating ones

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
you'll find in the home operating ones
or<00:00:59.930> what<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> call<00:01:01.140> less<00:01:01.410> expensive<00:01:02.070> models

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
or what I call less expensive models

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
or what I call less expensive models
these<00:01:02.880> are<00:01:02.940> natural<00:01:03.720> goat<00:01:04.559> bristle<00:01:04.979> brush<00:01:05.190> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
these are natural goat bristle brush and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
these are natural goat bristle brush and
they're<00:01:05.550> very<00:01:05.850> soft<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> gentle<00:01:06.630> you'll<00:01:07.259> see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
they're very soft and gentle you'll see

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
they're very soft and gentle you'll see
that<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> larger<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> another<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that one is larger and another one is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.249 
that one is larger and another one is
smaller<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:11.550> can<00:01:11.700> tell<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.149> pressure<00:01:12.509> it's

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
smaller you can tell my pressure it's

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.320 
smaller you can tell my pressure it's
about<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> medium<00:01:14.040> pressure<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.610> watch<00:01:14.820> what

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
about a medium pressure but watch what

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.730 
about a medium pressure but watch what
happens<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.050> pressing<00:01:16.470> too<00:01:16.619> far<00:01:18.410> into<00:01:19.410> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
happens if I'm pressing too far into the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
happens if I'm pressing too far into the
skin<00:01:20.040> pressing<00:01:20.490> too<00:01:20.640> far<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> skin<00:01:21.539> or

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
skin pressing too far into the skin or

skin pressing too far into the skin or
pressing<00:01:21.960> too<00:01:22.319> hard<00:01:22.350> its<00:01:23.250> plays<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.940> this<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pressing too hard its plays out this is

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.859 
pressing too hard its plays out this is
not<00:01:24.899> correct<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.399> going<00:01:26.640> too<00:01:26.880> hard<00:01:27.149> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
not correct you are going too hard that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.290 
not correct you are going too hard that
is<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> goal<00:01:28.649> hard<00:01:29.310> pressure<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.060> not

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
is not the goal hard pressure is not

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.600 
is not the goal hard pressure is not
what<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.899> with<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.080> brush<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.950> working

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
what we do with a brush it's working

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690 
what we do with a brush it's working
over<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.209> area<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> rather<00:01:35.069> than<00:01:35.340> pressing

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
over that area so rather than pressing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.900 
over that area so rather than pressing
harder<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.229> clean<00:01:37.679> that<00:01:37.950> area<00:01:38.310> try<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.640> clean

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
harder to clean that area try to clean

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.169 
harder to clean that area try to clean
that<00:01:39.060> area<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:40.110> spend<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.679> time<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.280> so

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
that area just spend more time there so

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.760 
that area just spend more time there so
we're<00:01:42.330> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> work<00:01:42.929> up<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.289> side<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
we're going to work up the side of the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.180 
we're going to work up the side of the
nose<00:01:44.060> around<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.390> lip<00:01:47.030> around<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.360> chin

this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.920> handle<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:04.440> these<00:02:04.679> are

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this is the handle and then these are

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.940 
this is the handle and then these are
the<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.250> glass<00:02:05.640> cylinders<00:02:06.500> what<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.800> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the two glass cylinders what I like to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.320 
the two glass cylinders what I like to
do<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.369> start<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:08.880> at<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> decollete<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
do is start down at the decollete and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.470 
do is start down at the decollete and
working<00:02:12.440> approximately<00:02:13.440> 15<00:02:14.160> inches<00:02:15.150> away

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
working approximately 15 inches away

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
working approximately 15 inches away
working<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.770> circular<00:02:17.040> motion<00:02:17.430> at<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> good

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
working in a circular motion at a good

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.589 
working in a circular motion at a good
distance<00:02:18.060> across<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> decollete<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
distance across the decollete and

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.880 
distance across the decollete and
there's<00:02:21.599> two<00:02:21.780> ways<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.200> doing<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.740> can

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
there's two ways of doing this you can

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.449 
there's two ways of doing this you can
just<00:02:22.950> mist<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.689> mist<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.459> effleurage

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
just mist or you can mist and effleurage

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.510 
just mist or you can mist and effleurage
the<00:02:26.970> product<00:02:27.390> into<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.720> skin

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
the product into the skin

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.310 
the product into the skin
and<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:29.240> work<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.840> product<00:02:30.290> into<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.620> skin

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
and just work the product into the skin

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.370
