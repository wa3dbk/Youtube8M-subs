00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.199
 colleague he is not solo unfortunately he 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.420
 It is not the best deal there that will 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.760
 give 500 thousand per car 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.769
 it gives 20 000 per minute but this is a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.780
 garbage that is worth doing so 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 When you 're in the shouting hangover 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.399
