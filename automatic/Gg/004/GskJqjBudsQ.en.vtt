00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.520
 Chapter 3 Chanel and Diamonds 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.000
 "I choose diamonds, 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.440
 "Because it contains the greatest value in the smallest volume." 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.440
 In 1932, Gabriel Chanel 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.800
 She has always been known for her costumes and jewels with oriental pearls and colored stones. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.600
 For the first time, shifting the focus of creation to the most precious diamonds 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.520
 The shadow of the Great Depression in 1929 is still 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.840
 The Diamond Association chose Ms. Chanel instead of the historic jewellery brands at Fontaine Square. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920
 I believe she can make the diamond shine the most eye-catching 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.400
 A meteor-like, short-lived, but legendary jewellery collection has since been born. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.520
 Gabriel Chanel simplifies the design of jewelry 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.760
 Make the previous style instantly obsolete 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.520
 No longer just overwhelming the value of gems 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 It is like a haute couture dress, emphasizing the beauty of lines and patterns. 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 She arbitrarily puts in or removes those diamonds 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.080
 Just like she once dismantled and reorganized the jewels of the Duke of Westminster 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.480
 Designed separately, giving the jewel a new vitality 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.760
 She emphasizes the smoothness of the lines and the freedom to wear 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.240
 Remove the buckle and lengthen the necklace 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.520
 Let the comet shine on the shoulders and let the stars fall on the chest 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.960
 She said, "I want my jewelry to be light and fit, like a ribbon wrapped around a woman's finger." 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.960
 Gabriel Chanel takes the stars off the sky in Paris 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.720
 "I want to decorate women with the stars." 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.760
 "Stars! Big, small, shining stars, dotted in hair." 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.720
 She has set 5 themes for the Diamond Jewelry collection. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.400
 5, her lucky number 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.520
 Like the epitome of her style: the magic of the stars 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 The sun's rays, the ribbon's elegant 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.840
 The tassel is agile, the feathers are light 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 Ms. Chanel illuminates her bleak childhood 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 Through these diamonds, stars, crescent moon, sun and maltese cross 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.040
 Shaped like a mosaic pattern on the ground of the Obasin Monastery 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 That is the only way for the orphan girl, Gabriel, to go to Mass every day. 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.440
 Gabriel Chanel does not show jewelry at her boutique in Conpeng Street 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.000
 And at her private home, 29 St. Honore Street, Paris 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.760
 She does not use a display case and black velvet pad 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 And showcase high jewelry with a simple wax figure 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.600
 These waxy dolls have elegant hair styles and beautiful makeup. 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.440
 Male-dominated jeweler in Fontaine Square 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.920
 Simultaneously request that these jewelry be disassembled after the show 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.760
 Ms. Chanel said, "We should let the most beautiful things pass away, isn't it?" 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.600
 The 1932 design is the first and only high jewelry collection for Chanel. 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.800
 But she created an eternal style: 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.560
 Creativity is more important than showing off wealth, lighter than grandiose 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.920
 For the first time, a female designer stepped into the Fontaine Square with innovative ideas. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.440
 Like the fire of the Sugawara, awakening the sleeping jewellery world 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.240
 Today's Chanel jewelry series is based on yesterday's foundation. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.560
 Reinterpreted stars, tassels and ribbons 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.440
 Use other elements of the Chanel aesthetic universe: 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.440
 Such as camellia, lion, pearl 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.960
 Today, wear a diamond necklace on a T-shirt. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000
 Has become a fashion characterization, or more precisely an elegant style 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 That is a silent tribute to the elimination of stereotypes, that is, the obligation that beauty must not be fulfilled, and it is not necessary to stick to tradition. 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.720
 Beauty is a way of life, an attitude 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.880
 The ladies who chose Chanel diamond jewelry show such a pioneering concept. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.160
 Today, jewelry is no longer a trophy for admirers to women, but a symbol of freedom. 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.760
 Many diamonds on the coat, on the skin or on the hair 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.000
 Women with their unique brilliance, power and sparkle 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.400
 Eternal Chanel and Diamond
