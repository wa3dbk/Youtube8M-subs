00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.909
 a day to all and welcome to this walk of the years 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.589
 right before finished the disappearance of glaciers and fed by a basin 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:36.130
 Mountain slope guaranteeing the purity of its guests 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.510
 Lake Annecy 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 the quality of these aquatic environments exceptional context 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.489
 thanks to the action of men 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 these natural treasures have been preserved and now play a vital role in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 water resources for nearly 130 thousand inhabitants 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.620
 as happy to serve you 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.910
 I will be your android 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.570
 for the presentation of water treatment equipment 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.170
 the agglomeration of annecy 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.170
 right now a little history 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.560
 in January 2009 by the will of the 13 member municipalities 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.399
 Agglomeration Annecy supports the production and distribution 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.399
 drinking water 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.790
 it inherits the action of the city of Annecy and takes over by adapting the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.200
 modernization project of the existing system as well as studies 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 made to meet the new European standards for water quality 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 but also sites of the spoon he was chosen in 1906 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.170
 after two years of debate 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.149
 to house an innovative system for producing drinking water 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.799
 from the left the calligraphy sign modernize to three 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.180
 times in the 20th century 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.580
 its reliability its production capabilities so never been taken into 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.370
 fault 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.980
 this shows the relevance of the initial choice of our predecessors 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.380
 more 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 because century 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.050
 more than thirty years after the latest innovation the modernization of 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.109
 equipment had become necessary 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.070
 first to meet a health safety requirement 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.880
 for example in case of accidental pollution due to road traffic 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.869
 close 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.249
 but also to ensure continuity of service but my favorite of 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:20.959
 Conflicts 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.589
 produced by all water circuits 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.589
 by increasing the volume of stored water 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.239
 the process is complex 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.409
 it must take into account rehabilitating the project costs 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.499
 but also the impact on the environment 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.499
 let's see more in detail solution restraint 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.180
 let's start with the water intake in the lake 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.330
 according to the studies it is deeper and further away from the shore 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.250
 the perimeter of protection on the surface of the lake was enlarged 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.249
 result 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:02.999
 an element yet especially to buy tank buried after the phases 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.579
 of alert in which raw transit in order to control its qualities in 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.019
 upstream of the treatment thanks to a measuring station of a possible 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.349
 pollution 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.810
 an extension of the main building is built instead of the old ones 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.540
 satellites it brings together the new, larger pumps replacing the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.540
 equipment some of which were older than 30 years 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.649
 the water treatment phase then 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.839
 the old system was time to put a filtration step using 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.559
 microtechnology friction suspended particles 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:35.029
 a step of oxidation with ozone juan parasites and viruses and others 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:35.729
 bacteria 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.729
 chlorine disinfection 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.999
 the new membrane filtration process it is characterized by a 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.199
 very important microorganism retention capacity 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.949
 we talk about the traffic ration it also avoids the use of products 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.279
 chemical treatment 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.279
 friends' microphones are kept as pre-treatment 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.959
 of course an extension of the current machined to install these new 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.709
 filters for possible toast 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.629
 passersby degraded the landscape 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
 the choice of a second site near the first symposium 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.919
 the rear machined feeds drinking water three reservoirs serving 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 not gravity much of the agglomeration 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.860
 Moreover, the position of the tanks filling ducts under the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.390
 national road along the lake 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.279
 grandy for a long time their problematic maintenance 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
 it was necessary to study the possibility of another route for its products 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.790
 a plot is finally recognized in the sector the Spaniards to host 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.159
 the construction of the new building 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.759
 it is at a satisfactory altitude to feed the 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:51.480
 reservoirs 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.450
 and allows to abandon historic canals under the replaced national 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.300
 by an underground gallery 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.389
 moreover one of the main advantages of this second site 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.389
 and that he's practically this disciple since the 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.439
 the county since the postwar period is set in a membrane a thousand times more 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.309
 fine that the edges of the Meuse 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:13.289
 once cleared of any impurity 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.499
 the water is stored in a new tank of 8 cubic meters 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.659
 bringing the amount of water stored a day of consumption 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.209
 to ensure good water quality throughout its journey in 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:24.249
 the pipes 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:26.870
 a tiny amount of chlorine and add 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.800
 this new factory is fully driven by programmable logic controllers 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 those that offer dependability 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.120
 Of course, special importance is attached to 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.939
 the landscape integration of the hopeless building 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.339
 the chosen part is that of placing the bulk of the volumes 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.910
 buried 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.910
 and revegetate the parts an equipment agency 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.009
 to deliver water to the distribution networks a summer pipeline 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.880
 established between the Spaniards and the Belvedere Reservoir 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.879
 in which a regulating device is installed 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.879
 who constantly analyze the water needs of the territory served 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.360
 with this set of equipment the water service of the community of 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.550
 the agglomeration of annecy 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.699
 has the necessary means to distribute even safer water 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.169
 sanitary quality plan 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.069
 he is better equipped to deal with technical incidents involving the 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.430
 production capacity 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.300
 coface 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.090
 the advent of these new facilities it allows to expand in 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.210
 safely the water distribution of the lake from where the low hard that is 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.280
 appreciated to 125 thousand inhabitants of the agglomeration of annecy
