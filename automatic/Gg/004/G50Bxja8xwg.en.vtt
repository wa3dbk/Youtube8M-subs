00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.980
 the game tested today very 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.690
 interesting but the rules are not 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.509
 very complicated and I explained to you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.830
 before playing what is the purpose of the game 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.509
 in this game we embody a gentleman a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 nice sir and his job is 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 to be a thief but a nice thieves 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 and when the game starts we are 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.630
 already in a house that does not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 does not belong right now it's a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 nice nasty thieves the house is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.310
 filled with objects of all kinds as 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.320
 every house in the world and our 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
 thief has a list that's his list 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.710
 of things to steal the purpose of the game will be 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.090
 doubled all the objects written on the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.320
 list before the owner of the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.329
 house does not return she tries to us 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 bang on the head to punish us 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.309
 then you'll see a microwave one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.649
 bike a guitar a radio a console 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 a game of gold baroin here is the microwave 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.820
 almost stealing the flat micro from play3 not 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.570
 of that the questions maybe not if you 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.809
 are not looking at all are looking at 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.090
 few cases what has castilla 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 barbecue time I think 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.800
 the guy get into the house will be able 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.730

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.730

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.579
 when this noise CEMAC already haunts top 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.470
 kim did because we are where the part 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.860
 to us at the time we will make a 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.860
 fence 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.370

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.730
 trash a tire another slow and a 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.500
 barbecue we'll see if they get to 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.700
 to go through the door with all that is but we 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.020
 could turn on the lights that's 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 much more practical of the habitat move 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.460
 they arrive they arrive I added 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.460

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.790
 damn it makes a noise that's 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.040
 insupportable 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.840
