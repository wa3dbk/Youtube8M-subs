00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.599
 road cycling it looks like a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.720
 individual sport but he is totally 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.599
 collective leave between six and eight 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.360
 athletes by team and the tests are 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.230
 concludes high footage ranging from 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.000
 600 and 1,000 kilometers each competition 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.059
 so we depend on a job of 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 team where each team has a leader 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.670
 are six athletes working for a 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.510
 athlete of each team is the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.510
 win the race 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 the athlete who was determined that he 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.350
 be the leader of the team on that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 competition or step ne 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.110
 he is really he gets protected the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.850
 wind is not the person who is picking up 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.010
 first part of the wind ale 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
 she spends more energy than the athlete 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.879
 that is in the vacuum is that we say that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 is that athlete was given while the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.619
 other athletes are working 100% I 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 I'm behind the team. 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.900
 I save up to 70% of energy and this 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 total difference at the end of 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.540
 competition that's why the work 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.540
 team's 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 the little team the maximum wind athlete 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.080
 possible the team is always together with 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 him to get a bike reservation hole 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.630
 tire 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 sometimes it may fall during the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.060
 competition and also has the issue of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.009
 feed a team leader he 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.810
 usually it will not until the car has 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.009
 that to look for food he has the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 his companions to do this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.930
 work will lead to food and water 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.810
 isotonic to him all this to save 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.330
 energy at a time when this decisive 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.459
 he is energetic enough to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.890
 be able to fight for competition 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:00.149
 in a long stage of 150 kilometers to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.709
 people left in 81 130 we already lost 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.660
 more or less two cyclists have already done 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.440
 that first part of the work of the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.780
 team 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 then another 15 kms 29 fourth people 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.470
 loses two more are those athletes who 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.840
 they worked and he can not stay in the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.550
 main group because it really did 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
 his work right for the leader 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.790
 can play its role in the last 15 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 20 km 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.720
 When the final moment comes the time to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.120
 decide the competition there my time to 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.440
 time that I have to spend all that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.440
 energy that I saved during step 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:43.049
 it is a joint work where your 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.579
 team is and this is already accustomed to 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.260
 athlete accustomed to deliver each 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.999
 feature is pulling this is very 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.249
 difficult it is not a test but it stays 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.319
 very happy when the team wins because 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.129
 he is a key player in his tactics 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.799
 fundamental 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.120
 really is the motto of the musketeers right 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.120
 one for all and all for one
