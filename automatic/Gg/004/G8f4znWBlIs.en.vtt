00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
she went in the semi so I didn't think

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.770 
she went in the semi so I didn't think
she<00:00:50.949> over<00:00:51.280> swam<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.879> post<00:00:52.150> Vicki<00:00:52.449> which<00:00:52.629> is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
she over swam that post Vicki which is

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.799 
she over swam that post Vicki which is
really<00:00:53.140> good<00:00:53.320> news<00:00:53.559> her<00:00:54.010> fastest<00:00:54.549> time<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:55.030> 207

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
really good news her fastest time is 207

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.369 
really good news her fastest time is 207
but<00:00:56.019> I<00:00:56.049> think<00:00:56.409> 206<00:00:56.979> low<00:00:57.220> wins<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.729> medal<00:00:57.850> year

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
but I think 206 low wins a medal year

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.039 
but I think 206 low wins a medal year
