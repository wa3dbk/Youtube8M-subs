how Kingston measures endurance yeah for
for<00:00:10.150> a<00:00:10.180> particular<00:00:10.690> SSD<00:00:11.260> at<00:00:11.590> Kingston<00:00:11.980> here<00:00:12.129> we

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
for a particular SSD at Kingston here we

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.449 
for a particular SSD at Kingston here we
use<00:00:12.639> a<00:00:12.719> calculation<00:00:13.719> called<00:00:14.049> tbw<00:00:15.039> are<00:00:15.100> total

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
use a calculation called tbw are total

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.929 
use a calculation called tbw are total
bytes<00:00:15.670> written<00:00:16.119> yeah<00:00:16.449> to<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.140> drive<00:00:17.410> and

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
bytes written yeah to the drive and

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.980 
bytes written yeah to the drive and
let's<00:00:18.939> talk<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.150> little<00:00:19.269> bit<00:00:19.480> about<00:00:19.599> how<00:00:19.929> we

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
let's talk a little bit about how we

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.769 
let's talk a little bit about how we
arrive<00:00:20.380> at<00:00:20.560> that<00:00:20.679> value<00:00:21.070> sure<00:00:21.339> and<00:00:21.580> what<00:00:22.539> you

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
arrive at that value sure and what you

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.450 
arrive at that value sure and what you
know<00:00:22.900> what<00:00:23.109> that<00:00:23.259> means<00:00:23.439> to<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:24.009> user

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
know what that means to the user

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.519 
know what that means to the user
okay<00:00:24.759> well<00:00:25.029> I<00:00:25.060> think<00:00:25.300> with<00:00:25.630> tvw<00:00:26.230> that<00:00:26.439> the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
okay well I think with tvw that the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.700 
okay well I think with tvw that the
biggest<00:00:26.890> thing<00:00:27.009> is<00:00:27.130> that<00:00:27.160> it's<00:00:27.970> it's<00:00:28.419> not<00:00:28.710> it's

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
biggest thing is that it's it's not it's

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.760 
biggest thing is that it's it's not it's
it's<00:00:29.980> very<00:00:31.169> variable<00:00:32.169> right<00:00:32.470> it's<00:00:32.710> very

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
it's very variable right it's very

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.010 
it's very variable right it's very
dynamic<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:33.760> I<00:00:33.850> know<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.420> lot<00:00:34.809> of<00:00:34.840> our

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
dynamic and I know a lot of our

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.139 
dynamic and I know a lot of our

or I think the guy that's doing things
with<00:01:14.680> premiere<00:01:15.430> or<00:01:15.670> videos<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.300> know<00:01:16.600> all<00:01:16.720> of

with premiere or videos you know all of
that<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.380> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.770> be<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.240> variable<00:01:19.240> within

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
that is going to be a variable within

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.910 
that is going to be a variable within
there<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.990> it's<00:01:20.140> going<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.350> affect<00:01:20.470> Wow

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920

know<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.420> numbers<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.080> choose<00:01:41.320> are

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
know the numbers that we choose are

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.110 
know the numbers that we choose are
actually<00:01:41.770> pretty<00:01:41.980> conservative<00:01:42.400> right<00:01:42.910> for

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
actually pretty conservative right for

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.210 
actually pretty conservative right for
our<00:01:43.210> desktop<00:01:43.630> workloads<00:01:44.110> we<00:01:44.590> use<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.770> wife<00:01:45.040> of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
our desktop workloads we use a wife of

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.790 
our desktop workloads we use a wife of
four<00:01:45.520> which<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:46.120> think<00:01:46.360> actually<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.960> very<00:01:47.230> very

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
four which I think actually is very very

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100 
four which I think actually is very very
conservative<00:01:48.190> okay<00:01:48.850> okay<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:49.390> great<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:49.870> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
conservative okay okay so great so so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.390 
conservative okay okay so great so so
what<00:01:50.260> you're<00:01:50.350> saying<00:01:50.620> essentially<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.250> that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
what you're saying essentially is that

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.430 
what you're saying essentially is that
you<00:01:51.910> know<00:01:52.000> your<00:01:52.210> typical<00:01:52.330> client<00:01:52.780> workload<00:01:53.320> is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
you know your typical client workload is

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.390 
you know your typical client workload is
is<00:01:53.560> pretty<00:01:53.770> predictable

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
is pretty predictable

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.899 
is pretty predictable
yeah<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:54.820> compressible<00:01:55.570> right

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
yeah it's compressible right

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.660 
yeah it's compressible right
we<00:01:57.060> pretty<00:01:57.539> much<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.960> where<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.409> fall<00:01:58.740> in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we pretty much know where we fall in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
we pretty much know where we fall in
regards<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.240> our<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.689> amplification

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
regards to our right amplification

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
regards to our right amplification
factor<00:02:01.859> but<00:02:02.490> again<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.030> back<00:02:03.270> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
factor but again kind of going back to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
factor but again kind of going back to
those<00:02:03.479> purpose-built<00:02:04.020> systems<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:04.979> kind<00:02:05.219> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
those purpose-built systems it's kind of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130 
those purpose-built systems it's kind of
difficult<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.819> gauge<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.990> their

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
difficult to gauge as to what their

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.240 
difficult to gauge as to what their
wife's<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.859> based<00:02:08.129> on

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
wife's going to be based on

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.580 
wife's going to be based on
compressibility<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.929> random<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
compressibility right how random the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.320 
compressibility right how random the
data<00:02:10.799> is<00:02:11.069> yeah<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.060> forth<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.560> T<00:02:13.739> BW<00:02:14.190> is

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
data is yeah and so forth so so T BW is

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.930 
data is yeah and so forth so so T BW is
again<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.720> rough<00:02:16.170> estimate<00:02:16.769> yep<00:02:17.099> or

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
again kind of a rough estimate yep or

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.330 
again kind of a rough estimate yep or
kind<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.720> best<00:02:18.930> guess<00:02:19.230> yeah

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
kind of best guess yeah

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.360 
kind of best guess yeah
but<00:02:20.810> individual<00:02:21.810> user<00:02:22.260> application<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.160> data

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
but individual user application and data

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.220 
but individual user application and data
is<00:02:23.849> really<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.299> determine<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:25.200> know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
is really going to determine you know

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.830 
is really going to determine you know
what<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> tbw<00:02:26.250> life<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.730> drive<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.269> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
what the tbw life of that drive is and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
what the tbw life of that drive is and
that's<00:02:27.959> where<00:02:28.140> smart<00:02:28.440> kicks<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.010> right<00:02:29.040> we

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that's where smart kicks in right we

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
that's where smart kicks in right we
talked<00:02:29.579> about<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.910> earlier<00:02:30.239> right<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.660> we

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
talked about that earlier right what we

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.660 
talked about that earlier right what we
give<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.170> would<00:02:31.739> give<00:02:31.920> our<00:02:32.069> users<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
give you would give our users is the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.699 
give you would give our users is the
ability<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> monitor<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.870> right<00:02:34.200> once

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
ability to monitor that and right once

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.199 
ability to monitor that and right once
you<00:02:34.769> understand<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.340> your<00:02:35.549> laugh<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.970> then

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
you understand what your laugh is then

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.970 
you understand what your laugh is then
you<00:02:36.299> can<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.720> calculate<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.200> own<00:02:37.260> T<00:02:37.560> V<00:02:37.680> W

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you can really calculate your own T V W

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.800 
you can really calculate your own T V W
at<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.160> right<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:38.910> know<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.690> know

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
at that right and so I know you know

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.539 
at that right and so I know you know
we've<00:02:40.290> got<00:02:40.440> resources<00:02:40.739> on<00:02:40.980> our<00:02:41.010> website<00:02:41.129> to

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
we've got resources on our website to

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.130 
we've got resources on our website to
talk<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.480> we've<00:02:42.900> shared

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
talk about that you know we've shared

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.690 
talk about that you know we've shared
that<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.379> customers<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> know<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> person

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that with customers you know in person

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.150 
that with customers you know in person
you<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.540> once<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.810> understand<00:02:46.200> laughs<00:02:46.440> tbw

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you know once you understand laughs tbw

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.339 
you know once you understand laughs tbw
at<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.400> point<00:02:47.640> becomes<00:02:47.910> more<00:02:48.120> real<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.660> know

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
at that point becomes more real you know

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.660 
at that point becomes more real you know
anything<00:02:49.620> else<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.310> you've<00:02:50.459> said

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
anything else is just like you've said

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.979 
anything else is just like you've said
almost<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.030> best<00:02:51.239> guess<00:02:51.480> right<00:02:51.720> we're<00:02:51.900> making

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
almost the best guess right we're making

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.410 
almost the best guess right we're making
an<00:02:52.260> assumption<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.859> so<00:02:53.099> most<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.940> what<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> see

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
an assumption and so most of what I see

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.539 
an assumption and so most of what I see
well<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.829> guess<00:02:55.950> said<00:02:56.069> if<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.340> want<00:02:56.489> to

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
well and I guess said if you want to

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.949 
well and I guess said if you want to
call<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> market<00:02:57.060> inspect<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.750> fine

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
call the market inspect that that's fine

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.160 
call the market inspect that that's fine
most<00:02:58.560> people<00:02:58.799> are<00:02:58.890> probably<00:02:59.280> ultra

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
most people are probably ultra

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.020 
most people are probably ultra
aggressive<00:03:01.170> when<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.069> comes<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> their<00:03:02.459> tvw

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
aggressive when it comes to their tvw

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.250 
aggressive when it comes to their tvw
numbers<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.510> I'm<00:03:03.599> not<00:03:03.810> sure<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.139> that's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
numbers and I'm not sure that that's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.930 
numbers and I'm not sure that that's
really<00:03:04.410> real-life<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:05.400> say<00:03:05.549> in<00:03:05.639> our<00:03:05.730> case

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
really real-life I would say in our case

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.430 
really real-life I would say in our case
we<00:03:06.269> tend<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.540> play<00:03:06.720> things<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.079> little<00:03:07.200> more

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
we tend to play things a little more

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.379 
we tend to play things a little more
conservatively<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.489> yeah<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> would

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
conservatively and so yeah I would

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.349 
conservatively and so yeah I would
expect<00:03:09.720> most<00:03:10.349> people<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.910> are<00:03:12.000> using<00:03:12.150> our

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
expect most people that are using our

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.960 
expect most people that are using our
drives<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> desktop<00:03:13.260> or<00:03:13.590> or<00:03:14.130> or<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.910> know
