integrated<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.700> burned<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:51.539> run

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
integrated and burned in and I've run

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.979 
integrated and burned in and I've run
the<00:00:52.320> car<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:52.980> oh<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.899> 1,500<00:00:54.899> miles<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.879> I

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
the car about oh about 1,500 miles and I

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
the car about oh about 1,500 miles and I
still<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.739> whether<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.340> going

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
still have to work out whether I'm going

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.840 
still have to work out whether I'm going
to<00:01:02.600> install<00:01:03.600> an<00:01:03.840> o2<00:01:04.019> sensor<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:06.350> find<00:01:07.350> out

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
to install an o2 sensor or find out

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.810 
to install an o2 sensor or find out
there's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> means<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.890> set<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> ECU<00:01:13.820> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
there's a means to to set up the ECU so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
there's a means to to set up the ECU so
that<00:01:15.090> you're<00:01:15.780> basically<00:01:16.350> making<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:18.409> ECU<00:01:19.409> set

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that you're basically making the ECU set

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.960 
that you're basically making the ECU set
up<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> don't<00:01:21.360> need<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:22.340> o2<00:01:23.340> sensor

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
up to so that you don't need a o2 sensor

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
up to so that you don't need a o2 sensor
but<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.110> running<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.590> an

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
but right now it's kind of running in an

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.280 
but right now it's kind of running in an
open-loop<00:01:26.250> default<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.390> means<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
open-loop default which means it's it's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
open-loop default which means it's it's
it's<00:01:28.920> running<00:01:29.310> rich<00:01:29.869> but<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.880> performance<00:01:33.240> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's running rich but the performance is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's running rich but the performance is
okay<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.090> stalled

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
okay and I'm just a little bit stalled

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.830 
okay and I'm just a little bit stalled
on<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> car<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.909> soon<00:01:39.270> my

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
on on time on this car but I soon my

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.010 
on on time on this car but I soon my
next<00:01:40.490> thing<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> fine-tune

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
next thing to do is to is to fine-tune

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.160 
next thing to do is to is to fine-tune
the<00:01:43.500> performance<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.689> i'll<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.020> doing

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the performance and and i'll be doing

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.940 
the performance and and i'll be doing
that<00:01:46.500> next<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:49.409> fuel<00:01:49.860> gauge<00:01:50.149> works<00:01:51.439> all<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that next the fuel gauge works all of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.789 
that next the fuel gauge works all of
the<00:01:53.130> idiot<00:01:53.790> lights<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.500> include<00:01:56.250> work

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
the idiot lights in here i include work

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.780 
the idiot lights in here i include work
there's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> low<00:01:59.939> fuel<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:01.049> burns<00:02:01.469> white<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
there's a low fuel that burns white and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.630 
there's a low fuel that burns white and
you've<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.450> 40<00:02:04.170> kilometers<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you've got about 40 kilometers when that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
you've got about 40 kilometers when that
starts<00:02:06.350> flickering<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:07.829> on

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
starts flickering and then when it's on

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.639 
starts flickering and then when it's on
hard

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
hard

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.710 
hard
I think<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.009> manual<00:02:10.399> says<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.879> just<00:02:11.450> better

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
I think the manual says you just better

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.289 
I think the manual says you just better
get<00:02:11.900> fuel<00:02:12.640> immediately<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:16.549> tachometer

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
get fuel immediately the tachometer

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.860 
get fuel immediately the tachometer
works<00:02:18.370> speedometer<00:02:19.370> works<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.629> clock

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
works speedometer works but the clock

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.119 
works speedometer works but the clock
does<00:02:21.170> not<00:02:22.689> what<00:02:23.689> I'll<00:02:24.019> go<00:02:24.260> ahead<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.560> start<00:02:24.980> it

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
does not what I'll go ahead and start it

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.410 
does not what I'll go ahead and start it
up<00:02:27.189> okay<00:02:28.189> whether<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.579> can<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.180> oil

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
up okay whether you can see the oil

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.869 
up okay whether you can see the oil
pressure<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:31.090> charging<00:02:32.530> indicator<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.879> then

pressure the charging indicator and then

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.830 
pressure the charging indicator and then
there's<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.739> break<00:02:37.209> indicator<00:02:38.209> there<00:02:38.510> which

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
there's a a break indicator there which

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.649 
there's a a break indicator there which
will<00:02:39.349> illuminate<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.700> hand<00:02:40.939> brake<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.420> set

water<00:06:26.790> from<00:06:26.940> coming<00:06:27.300> in<00:06:27.890> through<00:06:28.890> here<00:06:29.160> and

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
water from coming in through here and

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.910 
water from coming in through here and
landing<00:06:29.820> on<00:06:29.940> this<00:06:30.240> i'm<00:06:30.510> just<00:06:30.720> going<00:06:30.900> to<00:06:30.960> by

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
landing on this i'm just going to by

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920 
landing on this i'm just going to by
putting<00:06:32.250> a<00:06:32.340> cover<00:06:32.610> on<00:06:32.730> it<00:06:32.880> will<00:06:33.150> run<00:06:33.360> off<00:06:33.570> and

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
putting a cover on it will run off and

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.450 
putting a cover on it will run off and
go<00:06:34.500> down<00:06:34.680> into<00:06:34.740> the<00:06:35.010> trough<00:06:35.340> here<00:06:35.400> and<00:06:36.290> and<00:06:37.460> run

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
go down into the trough here and and run

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.690 
go down into the trough here and and run
out<00:06:38.640> the<00:06:39.110> drain<00:06:40.110> tubes<00:06:40.440> is<00:06:40.800> there's<00:06:41.340> a<00:06:41.400> drain

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
out the drain tubes is there's a drain

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.420 
out the drain tubes is there's a drain
tube<00:06:42.000> on<00:06:42.210> each<00:06:42.420> side<00:06:42.830> but<00:06:43.830> anyway<00:06:46.310> see<00:06:47.310> the

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
tube on each side but anyway see the

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.510 
tube on each side but anyway see the
wiring<00:06:47.880> comes<00:06:48.150> through<00:06:48.630> i<00:06:49.220> could<00:06:50.220> have<00:06:50.340> put

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
wiring comes through i could have put

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.720 
wiring comes through i could have put
this<00:06:50.700> down<00:06:51.480> in<00:06:51.780> behind<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.230> glove<00:06:52.470> box<00:06:52.730> but

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
this down in behind the glove box but

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.990 
this down in behind the glove box but
it's<00:06:53.880> just<00:06:54.720> a<00:06:54.900> real<00:06:55.290> bear<00:06:55.740> to<00:06:55.980> get<00:06:56.160> to<00:06:56.400> and<00:06:56.730> i

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
it's just a real bear to get to and i

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.940 
it's just a real bear to get to and i
wasn't<00:06:57.480> sure<00:06:57.630> exactly<00:06:57.900> what<00:06:58.440> i<00:06:58.470> was<00:06:58.680> going<00:06:58.860> to

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
wasn't sure exactly what i was going to

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.360 
wasn't sure exactly what i was going to
do<00:06:59.130> i<00:06:59.430> may<00:06:59.940> move<00:07:00.180> it<00:07:00.360> yet<00:07:00.800> that<00:07:01.800> it<00:07:01.920> made<00:07:02.070> up<00:07:02.220> my

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
do i may move it yet that it made up my

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.870 
do i may move it yet that it made up my
mind<00:07:02.400> yet<00:07:05.120> the<00:07:06.120> motor<00:07:06.810> that<00:07:07.530> came<00:07:08.340> out<00:07:08.580> of<00:07:08.610> the

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.170 
635 at about 97,000 miles on it and i

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.550 
635 at about 97,000 miles on it and i
had<00:07:16.710> compression<00:07:17.400> at<00:07:18.210> on<00:07:18.660> each<00:07:18.870> cylinder<00:07:19.260> at

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.930 
had compression at on each cylinder at

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
around 205 2209 on all the cylinders and

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.210 
around 205 2209 on all the cylinders and
there<00:07:24.090> was<00:07:24.210> no<00:07:24.390> disparity<00:07:24.990> any<00:07:25.530> remarkable

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220

pretty<00:07:39.660> nice

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:41.849 
pretty nice
