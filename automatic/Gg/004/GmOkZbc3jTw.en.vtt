00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.129
 as in the triangle of Bermuda in the Atlantic in the triangle of 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.329
 proclamation from the Pacific on the shores of Japan it is believed that the so-called continuous 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.130
 space-time of the planet is unsettled 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 It has been reported that this unexplained phenomenon can cause 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.150
 boats and planes lose their course by km and suddenly the clocks change 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.840
 now everyone is constant 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.970
 some of the theories formulated to explain the phenomenon of the triangle of 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.430
 dragon include a magnetic anomaly a kind of black hole 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.840
 in the ocean arch of outer space that produces a buzz that interacts 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.850
 with the ships that pass by there 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.800
 he even disappears, however, as far as we know this follows 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800
 happening and we do not have an explanation 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.940
 at the end of the 50s the personality of radio and television 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 American arzÃº court 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.430
 and an expert pilot accompanying him reported having experienced a 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.230
 frightening experience in the dragon triangle that almost cost them their lives 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.770
 the band director and personality of the American television of the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.350
 era of the 50 free articles I was piloting a twin-engine plane over 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.710
 the dragon triangle 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.780
 when he observed an unidentified submersible object 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.200
 the instruments of his plane went out and he had to orient himself 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.290
 Sun since your compass stopped working 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.320
 when the instruments lit again one comes back to earth it 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.860
 he realized that he had lost a period of time during the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.710
 experience 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.970
 having fuel for only three hours deprived them once according to their 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.680
 estimate for one hour 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.880
 after which his instruments returned to work and he was able to return to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 its course 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 however coffer and stated that in explainable he lost it half an hour 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 their watches literally stepped back the time 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.390
 fortunately for August and his crew arrived safely in 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.620
 Tokyo avoiding the terrible fate of Amelia &amp; Co 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.609
 and the innumerable others in the grain triangle 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.209
 other similar space-time anomalies happened in the triangle 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.590
 they were informed by military pilots in the 50s and 60s 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.219
 including the air force pilot ditched queens group advisor 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.459
 air transport I felt but sixth 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.810
 during the summer of 1968 he wrote in argos magazine and the history of the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.120
 change in the space-time continuum while flying over a freighter 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.269
 stratum faeca 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.889
 about the dragon triangle 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.949
 in the spring of 1966 he was a rookie on board the plane he was 97 from the guard 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.639
 Aerial teasing from the island Guaja 'la ing to Cuba 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.669
 We expected to have a pleasant night flight for approximately six 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:57.859
 hours and a half 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.529
 hopkins said that according to the protocol he established his position every gold using 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.949
 stellar navigation however during the third hour of flight something 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.499
 unexplained happened 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:11.199
 had already set the second heavenly point the weather was excellent the 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:15.099
 only problem and I almost fell off the plane when I put it on the map it was 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.569
 that the last point was almost 340 nautical miles below our 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.219
 course 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.039
 I went back to review a very old 97 e traveled 340 nautical miles in a 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.039
 time for no apparent reason 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:36.079
 then upon landing in Copan Hopkins informed his commanding officer that his 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.589
 plane had strayed many miles from its course but there are no records of 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:41.979
 report 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.459
 hopkins says he remains convinced that the aria has particular strength 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.459
 which represent a great danger for airplanes and boats 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.459
 Due to the concentration of these events the experts continue to think 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.959
 that possibly other forces may be that being in the depths 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.929
 of the triangle 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:06.559
 of all the anomalies of the dragon triangle none is so mysterious 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.289
 that the large number of UFO sightings
