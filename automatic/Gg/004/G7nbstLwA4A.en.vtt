00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.050
 Good friends! I am Aunt Frenita. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.990
 Today's story is called &lt;&lt;a unique outfit&gt;&gt; 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.980
 Today's Heart Festival is from Matthew 7:11 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.380
 "Your father in heaven, do you not give good things to those who ask Him?" 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.810
 The message we want to convey today is: God loves us, so give us good things. 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.140
 Think about one of your favorite gifts from your mom or dad. 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.060
 Just like Joseph’s father gave him a special gift. 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 God is also 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.720
 Joseph put the entire head in the water 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.950
 [laughter] 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.500
 When he got up, drowning and laughing 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.220
 The cool water feels good! 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.180
 Taking care of the sheep all day is a boring thing. 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.660
 Joseph Shantou 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.340
 Little drops of water flew everywhere. 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.340
 "Hey!" 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 "Be careful!" 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.070
 His brother, Reuben, shouted at him. 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 "Where is my son Joseph?" 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 Jacob has many sons, but his favorite son is Joseph. 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.390
 Jacob is old and his young son gives him a lot of happiness. 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 Joseph did not like the other ten brothers. 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.230
 They sometimes quarrel and sometimes bring trouble to their father. 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.180
 Joseph is gentle, and he often talks about truth, 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.840
 He is full of joy and makes his father laugh. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.820
 Joseph hurry to see what his father wants. 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.580
 Jacob picked up a special gift to Joseph. 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 Is a beautiful new coat 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.720
 This coat is the type worn by the ruler or other special person. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
 Joseph stretched his arm into his coat. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420
 He lifted a soft cloth with his arm 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.900
 "Thank you, father," he whispered. 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.660
 He especially likes the dazzling colors. 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.270
 Joseph’s brother frowned at him 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.650
 Why is he so special? 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.180
 Why does he often get gifts from his father? 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 My brothers complained. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.360
 One night, Joseph made an unusual dream. 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.250
 He told his brother the next day. 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.670
 "We bundled the bunches of wheat together in the field." 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.670
 "My bundle is standing, and your bundle of wheat is bowing to my bundle." 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.790
 "Do you really think we will bow to you?" The brothers showed anger 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.100
 They complained again. 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.690
 Soon after, Joseph made another dream. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.980
 "I saw the sun, the moon and the eleven stars bowing to me," he said. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.940
 Jacob gently scolded Joseph 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.630
 "Do you really think your mother, brother and I will bow to you?" he asked. 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.920
 No one knows the meaning of Joseph’s dream 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.350
 But Jacob has not forgotten 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.980
 But he will remember and understand later 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 Joseph got the protection and gift of God. 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.570
 God also gave Joseph a dream, and later let him understand the meaning of dreams. 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.520
 God guides Joseph's thoughts and gives him a good mind. 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.750
 God loves you too, blessing you with many gifts. 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.270
 He gives you good thoughts 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.790
 He will always help you do the right thing.
