question<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.599> rough<00:00:30.990> way<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.349> about<00:00:31.500> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
question the rough way to think about it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
question the rough way to think about it
is<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.040> well<00:00:32.880> there's<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> couple<00:00:33.360> things<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is this well there's a couple things you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
is this well there's a couple things you
need<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.140> first<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:35.130> about<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.520> in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
need to know first think about it in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.180 
need to know first think about it in
terms<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.360> happens<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.140> until<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
terms of what happens up until the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.610 
terms of what happens up until the
onload<00:00:38.670> event<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.600> there<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> lot<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> ways

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
onload event so there are a lot of ways

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
onload event so there are a lot of ways
where<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.309> synchronous

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
where you can do a synchronous

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
where you can do a synchronous
JavaScript<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> sort<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.260> sure<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
JavaScript to sort of make sure that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
JavaScript to sort of make sure that
things<00:00:43.829> happen<00:00:44.280> after<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> onload<00:00:45.149> event<00:00:45.300> for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
things happen after the onload event for

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
things happen after the onload event for
example<00:00:46.320> Google<00:00:46.440> Analytics<00:00:47.070> recently<00:00:47.700> just

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
example Google Analytics recently just

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
example Google Analytics recently just
introduced<00:00:48.300> code<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.170> will<00:00:49.200> handle<00:00:49.590> things

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
introduced code which will handle things

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
introduced code which will handle things
asynchronously<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> don't<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
asynchronously so you don't have to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
asynchronously so you don't have to
worry<00:00:52.050> anymore<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.620> okay<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.550> request

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
worry anymore about okay this request

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
worry anymore about okay this request
goes<00:00:54.149> off<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:55.110> happens<00:00:55.410> after<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.980> onload

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
goes off and it happens after the onload

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
goes off and it happens after the onload
event<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> onload<00:00:57.870> event<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> good<00:00:58.500> way

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
event so the onload event is a good way

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
event so the onload event is a good way
to<00:00:58.649> think<00:00:58.739> about<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.430> needs<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.270> happen

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
to think about what needs to happen

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
to think about what needs to happen
before<00:01:00.980> users<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.100> able<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> interact<00:01:02.640> with

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
before users are able to interact with

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.719 
before users are able to interact with
the<00:01:03.059> page<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> totality<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
the page what is the totality of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.920 
the page what is the totality of
everything<00:01:05.729> happening<00:01:06.180> before<00:01:06.570> they're<00:01:06.900> able

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
everything happening before they're able

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
everything happening before they're able
to<00:01:07.260> start<00:01:07.470> clicking<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.920> things<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.580> what

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to start clicking on things or see what

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.250 
to start clicking on things or see what
the<00:01:08.820> page<00:01:08.970> layout<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.600> looks<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the page layout really looks like and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
the page layout really looks like and
start<00:01:10.740> interacting<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.510> do

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
start interacting with it so you can do

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450 
start interacting with it so you can do
these<00:01:12.869> sort<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> asynchronous<00:01:13.460> JavaScript

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
these sort of asynchronous JavaScript

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.760 
these sort of asynchronous JavaScript
tricks<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.869> other<00:01:16.049> thing<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> keep<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.710> mind

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
tricks the other thing to keep in mind

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
tricks the other thing to keep in mind
is<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.850> vast<00:01:18.030> majority<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.570> people

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
is that the vast majority of people

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
is that the vast majority of people
really<00:01:19.200> won't<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> problem<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
really won't have a problem a lot of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
really won't have a problem a lot of
people<00:01:20.759> were<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.180> worried<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.570> page

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
people were really worried about page

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
people were really worried about page
speed<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.680> they're<00:01:22.770> saying<00:01:23.009> oh<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.430> worried

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
speed and they're saying oh I'm worried

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
speed and they're saying oh I'm worried
this<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.090> much<00:01:24.630> more<00:01:24.780> important<00:01:25.200> than

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this will be much more important than

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
this will be much more important than
the<00:01:25.470> actual<00:01:25.619> content<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the actual content and that's not the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
the actual content and that's not the
case<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> over<00:01:28.470> 200<00:01:29.189> different

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
case it's one of over 200 different

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.690 
case it's one of over 200 different
signals<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.360> content<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> reputation

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
signals the content and the reputation

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
signals the content and the reputation
definitely<00:01:32.700> matters<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.479> than<00:01:33.689> just

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
definitely matters a lot more than just

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
definitely matters a lot more than just
the<00:01:34.020> pure<00:01:34.229> page<00:01:34.500> speed<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.520> whenever<00:01:35.759> you're

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the pure page speed so whenever you're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 
the pure page speed so whenever you're
thinking<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> unless<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:37.380> really

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
thinking about it unless you're really

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.350 
thinking about it unless you're really
an<00:01:37.829> outlier<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> slowest

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
an outlier and you're one of the slowest

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.030 
an outlier and you're one of the slowest
sites<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.740> deciding

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
sites it's not going to be the deciding

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
sites it's not going to be the deciding
factor<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> sort<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.630> thing<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
factor that's not the sort of thing that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
factor that's not the sort of thing that
you<00:01:42.990> necessarily<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> worry<00:01:43.890> about<00:01:44.149> but

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you necessarily have to worry about but

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.179 
you necessarily have to worry about but
if<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> pay<00:01:46.500> attention<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
if you do want to pay attention to it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.350 
if you do want to pay attention to it
you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.759> sort<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.000> asynchronous

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you can do these sort of asynchronous

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840 
you can do these sort of asynchronous
calls<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.320> Google<00:01:49.590> Analytics<00:01:50.009> does<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
calls like Google Analytics does and I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
calls like Google Analytics does and I
think<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> lot<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.420> ad<00:01:51.720> servers<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.259> probably

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
think a lot of ad servers will probably

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.469 
think a lot of ad servers will probably
support<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> future<00:01:53.700> such

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
support this more in the future such

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.330 
support this more in the future such
that<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.110> onload<00:01:55.380> event<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.799> happen<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that the onload event can happen and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
that the onload event can happen and
then<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.180> show<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.600> afterwards<00:01:58.140> if

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
then things can show up afterwards if

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
then things can show up afterwards if
they<00:01:58.439> need<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.159> users<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
they need to and the users don't have to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
they need to and the users don't have to
wait<00:02:00.030> around<00:02:00.170> seen<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> slow<00:02:02.070> loading

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
wait around seen you know a slow loading

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.929 
wait around seen you know a slow loading
page<00:02:02.880> sort<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.299> situation<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.590> again<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.340> lot<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
page sort of situation so again a lot of

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
page sort of situation so again a lot of
people<00:02:06.060> always<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.509> about<00:02:06.869> how<00:02:07.320> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
people always think about how is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 
people always think about how is
PageSpeed<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> affect<00:02:08.610> things<00:02:08.759> do

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
PageSpeed going to affect things do

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.210 
PageSpeed going to affect things do
what's<00:02:09.629> right<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:09.989> users<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.709> think

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
what's right for your users and think

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.020 
what's right for your users and think
about<00:02:11.459> how<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> work<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.510> general

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
about how it's going to work in general

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.030 
about how it's going to work in general
but<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.569> most<00:02:13.750> situations<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.590> really<00:02:14.890> don't

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
but for most situations you really don't

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:25.030 
but for most situations you really don't
need<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.250> worry<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.490> much
