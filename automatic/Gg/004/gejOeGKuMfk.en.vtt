in there when you change lenses we've
made<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.330> o-ring<00:00:16.660> bright<00:00:16.960> yellow<00:00:17.260> so<00:00:17.560> it's

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
made the o-ring bright yellow so it's

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.230 
made the o-ring bright yellow so it's
kind<00:00:17.920> of<00:00:17.980> hard<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.220> miss<00:00:18.310> and<00:00:18.730> you<00:00:19.030> want<00:00:19.180> to

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.550 
kind of hard to miss and you want to
check<00:00:19.450> that<00:00:19.480> every<00:00:19.840> time<00:00:19.990> you<00:00:20.080> take<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.290> lens

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
yellow overing is in there we even

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.920 
yellow overing is in there we even
provide<00:00:24.369> some<00:00:24.760> extra<00:00:25.030> ones<00:00:25.240> so<00:00:25.570> if<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:25.750> do

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
lose it make sure you've got more when

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.950 
lose it make sure you've got more when
you're<00:00:30.970> starting<00:00:31.210> out<00:00:31.390> one<00:00:31.570> of<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:31.720> easiest

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
you're starting out one of the easiest

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.380 
you're starting out one of the easiest
lenses<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.469> screw<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.039> fisheye<00:00:33.489> when

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
lenses to screw and is the fisheye when

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.209 
lenses to screw and is the fisheye when
you<00:00:34.510> put<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.749> lens<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.289> it<00:00:35.499> should<00:00:35.739> screw<00:00:36.069> in

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
you put a lens in it should screw in

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.829 
you put a lens in it should screw in
very<00:00:36.489> easily<00:00:36.609> it<00:00:37.120> shouldn't<00:00:37.420> find<00:00:37.600> it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
very easily it shouldn't find it

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.540 
very easily it shouldn't find it
shouldn't<00:00:38.079> be<00:00:38.170> hard<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.589> screw<00:00:38.829> in<00:00:39.039> so<00:00:39.460> you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
shouldn't be hard to screw in so you

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.509 
shouldn't be hard to screw in so you
notice<00:00:39.819> I<00:00:39.969> put<00:00:39.999> that<00:00:40.359> lens<00:00:40.569> in<00:00:41.429> and<00:00:42.429> I'm

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
notice I put that lens in and I'm

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:43.979 
notice I put that lens in and I'm
screwing<00:00:42.940> in<00:00:43.030> with<00:00:43.179> barely<00:00:43.420> touching<00:00:43.899> my

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
screwing in with barely touching my

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.959 
screwing in with barely touching my
finger<00:00:44.409> so<00:00:44.829> you<00:00:44.920> don't<00:00:45.069> want<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.249> ever<00:00:45.370> force<00:00:45.819> a

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
finger so you don't want to ever force a

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.849 
finger so you don't want to ever force a
lens<00:00:46.210> if<00:00:46.749> you<00:00:46.899> do<00:00:47.050> start<00:00:47.289> to<00:00:47.379> screw<00:00:47.679> in<00:00:47.769> the

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
lens if you do start to screw in the

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.410 
lens if you do start to screw in the
lens<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.339> you're<00:00:48.489> finding<00:00:48.789> its<00:00:48.940> binding<00:00:49.210> a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
lens and you're finding its binding a

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.599 
lens and you're finding its binding a
little<00:00:49.449> bit<00:00:49.749> all<00:00:50.289> you<00:00:50.530> do<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.739> you<00:00:51.129> screw<00:00:51.460> the

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
little bit all you do is you screw the

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.059 
little bit all you do is you screw the
lens<00:00:51.819> as<00:00:52.179> though<00:00:52.329> you're<00:00:52.449> taking<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.899> off<00:00:54.269> and

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.069 
lens as though you're taking it off and

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.069 
lens as though you're taking it off and
you'll<00:00:57.069> feel<00:00:57.249> the<00:00:57.399> lens<00:00:57.609> seat<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.269> then<00:00:58.960> you

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
you'll feel the lens seat and then you

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.959 
you'll feel the lens seat and then you
go<00:00:59.170> back<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.409> proper<00:00:59.920> direction<00:01:00.069> this<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.850> to

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
go back to proper direction this is to

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.180 
go back to proper direction this is to
keep<00:01:01.120> from<00:01:01.299> cross<00:01:01.569> threading<00:01:01.959> a<00:01:02.019> lens<00:01:02.229> when

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
keep from cross threading a lens when

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.439 
keep from cross threading a lens when
you're<00:01:03.309> screwing<00:01:03.639> the<00:01:03.729> lens<00:01:03.909> in<00:01:04.089> you'll<00:01:04.239> feel

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
you're screwing the lens in you'll feel

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.060 
you're screwing the lens in you'll feel
that<00:01:04.629> it's<00:01:04.780> really<00:01:05.049> easy<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.379> screw<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.829> an<00:01:05.920> all

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
that it's really easy to screw in an all

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.709 
that it's really easy to screw in an all
sudden<00:01:06.340> you'll<00:01:06.460> feel<00:01:06.670> kind<00:01:06.939> of<00:01:07.030> like<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.420> little

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
sudden you'll feel kind of like a little

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.450 
sudden you'll feel kind of like a little
bit<00:01:07.930> of<00:01:08.020> resistance<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:09.039> is<00:01:09.189> where<00:01:09.340> you're

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
bit of resistance this is where you're

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.219 
bit of resistance this is where you're
actually<00:01:09.549> contacting<00:01:10.329> the<00:01:10.420> o-ring<00:01:10.750> now<00:01:11.170> to

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
actually contacting the o-ring now to

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.679 
actually contacting the o-ring now to
get<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.439> proper<00:01:11.860> waterproof<00:01:12.490> seal<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:13.390> want<00:01:13.600> to

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
get a proper waterproof seal you want to

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:14.880 
get a proper waterproof seal you want to
hit<00:01:13.810> that<00:01:13.840> o<00:01:14.140> ring<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.530> feel<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.860> a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
hit that o ring and you feel that a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.649 
hit that o ring and you feel that a
little<00:01:15.070> bit<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.250> resistance<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:16.270> want<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.509> go

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
little bit of resistance you want to go

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.870 
little bit of resistance you want to go
another<00:01:16.899> you<00:01:17.560> know<00:01:17.649> full<00:01:17.950> half<00:01:18.250> turn<00:01:18.640> if<00:01:18.850> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
another you know full half turn if you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.690 
another you know full half turn if you
can<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:20.409> pretty<00:01:20.680> easy<00:01:20.829> with<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.219> fish<00:01:21.399> angle

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
can it's pretty easy with the fish angle

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.569 
can it's pretty easy with the fish angle
lens<00:01:21.850> because<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.149> sticks<00:01:22.390> up<00:01:22.600> pretty<00:01:22.840> high

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
lens because it sticks up pretty high

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.050 
lens because it sticks up pretty high
but<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.619> I<00:01:26.770> show<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.070> with<00:01:27.189> another<00:01:27.430> lens<00:01:27.729> like

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
but if I show you with another lens like

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
but if I show you with another lens like
you<00:01:28.570> know<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:29.530> zero<00:01:29.799> degree<00:01:30.250> or<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.119> case

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you know the zero degree or in this case

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.069 
you know the zero degree or in this case
the<00:01:32.710> macro<00:01:33.100> lens<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.149> much<00:01:34.299> smaller<00:01:34.630> lens

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
the macro lens it's a much smaller lens

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.370 
the macro lens it's a much smaller lens
so<00:01:35.649> when<00:01:35.799> you're<00:01:35.890> screwing<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:37.380> it's

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
so when you're screwing this in it's

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.899 
so when you're screwing this in it's
