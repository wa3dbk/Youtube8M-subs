of an inch left when it's tight now the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.870 
of an inch left when it's tight now the
other<00:01:45.779> clevis<00:01:46.259> comes<00:01:46.529> down<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> one

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
other clevis comes down this is the one

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.599 
other clevis comes down this is the one
that<00:01:47.969> was<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.420> off<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.249> threads

that was way off you can see the threads

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.419 
that was way off you can see the threads
we<00:01:50.819> almost<00:01:50.999> added<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.779> in<00:01:52.139> oh<00:01:52.350> man<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.310> almost

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
we almost added it in oh man we almost

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.160 
we almost added it in oh man we almost
put<00:01:53.819> in<00:01:53.909> our<00:01:54.029> about<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.209> half<00:01:54.509> inch<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.869> thread

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
put in our about a half inch of thread

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.529 
put in our about a half inch of thread
so<00:01:55.679> when<00:01:55.859> this<00:01:56.100> pin<00:01:56.490> again<00:01:56.849> make<00:01:57.179> sure<00:01:57.209> you're

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
so when this pin again make sure you're

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.449 
so when this pin again make sure you're
using<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:57.869> pin<00:01:58.259> flow<00:01:58.469> tight<00:01:58.709> now<00:01:59.279> that

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
using the right pin flow tight now that

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.580 
using the right pin flow tight now that
we<00:01:59.549> push<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.929> this<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.409> the
