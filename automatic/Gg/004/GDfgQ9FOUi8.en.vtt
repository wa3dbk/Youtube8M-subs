00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.419 

and<00:00:59.899> here's<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.230> fisheye<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:00.949> still<00:01:01.219> mode

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
and here's the fisheye in the still mode

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.610 
and here's the fisheye in the still mode
as<00:01:02.179> you<00:01:02.359> can<00:01:02.510> see<00:01:02.719> we<00:01:02.870> get<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.019> very<00:01:03.350> obvious

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
as you can see we get a very obvious

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.190 
as you can see we get a very obvious

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
iphone naturally when you go into video

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.620 
iphone naturally when you go into video
it<00:01:12.590> crops<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.460> little<00:01:13.909> bit<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.149> does<00:01:14.270> not<00:01:14.420> use

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
it crops a little bit it does not use

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.320 
it crops a little bit it does not use
the<00:01:14.750> full<00:01:14.960> sensor<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.190> we<00:01:16.280> go<00:01:16.399> to<00:01:16.460> video<00:01:16.729> we<00:01:17.119> do

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the full sensor so we go to video we do

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.389 
the full sensor so we go to video we do
lose<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.899> barrel<00:01:18.289> distortion<00:01:18.470> as<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.250> can

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
lose that barrel distortion as you can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.270 
lose that barrel distortion as you can
see<00:01:19.899> but<00:01:20.899> if<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:21.320> still<00:01:21.590> have<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:21.830> curvature

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
see but if you still have that curvature

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.969 
see but if you still have that curvature
that<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.940> fish<00:01:23.270> i<00:01:23.420> will<00:01:23.659> give<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:23.990> if<00:01:24.649> i<00:01:24.770> take

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
that the fish i will give you if i take

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.790

the fish eye off however

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.840 
the fish eye off however
that's<00:01:28.070> always<00:01:28.430> see<00:01:29.200> basically<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.070> video

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
that's always see basically in the video

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.940 
that's always see basically in the video

the wide-angle lens is

the wide-angle lens is
we<00:01:40.460> call<00:01:40.640> rectilinear<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:41.960> it's<00:01:42.229> not<00:01:42.380> as

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
we call rectilinear so it's not as

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.310 
we call rectilinear so it's not as
dramatic<00:01:43.159> and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.399 

there's<00:01:47.950> no<00:01:48.100> curves<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.880> edge<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.140> just

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
there's no curves on the edge so it just

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.170 
there's no curves on the edge so it just
gives<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:50.770> nice<00:01:50.979> little<00:01:51.220> extra<00:01:51.729> bump<00:01:51.940> in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
gives you that nice little extra bump in

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.370 
gives you that nice little extra bump in
the<00:01:52.210> width<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.810> might<00:01:53.020> need<00:01:53.229> with<00:01:53.830> that
