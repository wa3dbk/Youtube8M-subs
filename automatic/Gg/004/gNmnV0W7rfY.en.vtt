00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.670 
with some shovels and stuff and dig that
could<00:02:57.519> have<00:02:57.640> been<00:02:57.730> their<00:02:57.910> camp<00:02:58.150> spot<00:02:58.680> because

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
could have been their camp spot because

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.180 
could have been their camp spot because
it's<00:02:59.890> exactly<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:01.120> front<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.690> where<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.190> are

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
it's exactly in front of where I are

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.070 
it's exactly in front of where I are
behind<00:03:03.430> where<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:03.970> found<00:03:04.209> all<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.600> pottery

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
behind where I found all that pottery

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.430 
behind where I found all that pottery
just<00:03:06.010> right<00:03:06.250> over<00:03:06.489> there<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.870> go<00:03:08.049> up<00:03:08.230> this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
just right over there and you go up this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.890 
just right over there and you go up this
way<00:03:08.680> about<00:03:08.920> 50<00:03:09.400> foot<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.970> there's<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.570> huge

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
way about 50 foot and there's a huge

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.300 
way about 50 foot and there's a huge
clearing<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:13.000> ground<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.540> leveled<00:03:13.989> out

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
clearing and the ground is leveled out

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.240 
clearing and the ground is leveled out
so<00:03:15.959> I'm<00:03:16.959> thinking<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.440> might<00:03:17.590> end<00:03:17.739> up<00:03:17.860> going<00:03:18.160> up

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
so I'm thinking I might end up going up

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.400 
so I'm thinking I might end up going up
here<00:03:18.430> one<00:03:18.610> day<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.180> do<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.079> little<00:03:20.230> bit

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
here one day and just do a little bit

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.599 
here one day and just do a little bit
digging<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:20.890> see<00:03:20.980> if<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.130> can't<00:03:21.340> see<00:03:21.549> if

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
digging and see if I can't see if

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.060 
digging and see if I can't see if
there's<00:03:21.760> any<00:03:21.940> fire<00:03:22.209> pits<00:03:22.540> or<00:03:22.810> anything<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
there's any fire pits or anything and

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.949 
there's any fire pits or anything and
hopefully<00:03:24.910> that'll<00:03:25.120> do<00:03:25.359> better<00:03:25.570> than<00:03:25.840> what

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
hopefully that'll do better than what

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.440 
hopefully that'll do better than what
the<00:03:26.140> creek<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.530> giving<00:03:26.859> me<00:03:26.980> today<00:03:27.299> I'm<00:03:28.299> gonna

the creek is giving me today I'm gonna

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.060 
the creek is giving me today I'm gonna
go<00:03:28.540> see<00:03:28.750> if<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.900> can't<00:03:29.170> find<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.470> new<00:03:29.500> entrance

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
go see if I can't find a new entrance

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.900 
go see if I can't find a new entrance
into<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:30.549> thing<00:03:32.220> well<00:03:33.220> that's<00:03:33.430> right<00:03:33.670> now

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
into this thing well that's right now

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.750 
into this thing well that's right now
that's<00:03:34.180> what<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.420> found<00:03:34.720> just<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:36.370> crude

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
that's what I found just this crude

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.420 
that's what I found just this crude
skate<00:03:37.120> scraper<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.709> base<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.250> base

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
skate scraper and this base the base

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.910 
skate scraper and this base the base
would<00:03:39.670> have<00:03:39.790> been<00:03:39.940> really<00:03:40.329> nice<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.799> would

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
would have been really nice if it would

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.539 
would have been really nice if it would
have<00:03:42.010> been<00:03:42.070> hole<00:03:43.019> but<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.340> worked

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
have been hole but so it worked

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.870 
have been hole but so it worked
sometimes<00:03:45.820> at<00:03:46.180> least<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.480> know<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.780> Creek<00:03:47.880> has

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
sometimes at least I know this Creek has

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.630 
sometimes at least I know this Creek has
stuff<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:50.140> got<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:51.010> think<00:03:51.489> I'm<00:03:51.549> gonna

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
stuff in it I just got I think I'm gonna

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.810 
stuff in it I just got I think I'm gonna
have<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.880> find<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.269> new<00:03:52.859> place<00:03:53.859> for<00:03:53.980> me<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.519> get

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
have to find a new place for me to get

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.020 
have to find a new place for me to get
down<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.420> searched<00:03:56.670> because<00:03:57.670> it

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
down in it and searched because it

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.090 
down in it and searched because it
doesn't<00:03:58.299> seem<00:03:58.420> like<00:03:58.799> there's<00:03:59.799> really<00:03:59.980> just

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
doesn't seem like there's really just

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.940 
doesn't seem like there's really just
not<00:04:00.430> much<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:00.940> much<00:04:01.180> here<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:02.319> can<00:04:02.470> go<00:04:02.620> about

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
not much that much here you can go about

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.440 
not much that much here you can go about
two<00:04:03.370> or<00:04:03.489> three<00:04:03.519> hundred<00:04:03.700> foot<00:04:04.180> either

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
two or three hundred foot either

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.160 
two or three hundred foot either
directions<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.260> then<00:04:05.410> use<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:06.190> gets<00:04:06.370> really

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
directions and then use it gets really

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.670 
directions and then use it gets really
wide<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.850> deep<00:04:09.850> very<00:04:10.239> deep<00:04:10.359> where<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.440> can't

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
wide and deep very deep where you can't

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.789 
wide and deep very deep where you can't
walk<00:04:11.889> it<00:04:12.220> anymore<00:04:12.699> so<00:04:13.359> I<00:04:13.440> like<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.470> find

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
walk it anymore so I like to find

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.430 
walk it anymore so I like to find
somewhere<00:04:15.760> else<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:16.060> enter<00:04:16.449> into<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.810> no<00:04:17.049> play

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
somewhere else to enter into it no play

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.890 
somewhere else to enter into it no play
it<00:04:18.310> will<00:04:18.430> give<00:04:18.580> me<00:04:18.700> more<00:04:18.730> walking<00:04:19.299> space<00:04:19.570> next

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
it will give me more walking space next

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.670 
it will give me more walking space next
buy<00:04:20.110> more<00:04:20.380> stuff<00:04:20.650> thanks<00:04:21.220> for<00:04:21.310> watching
