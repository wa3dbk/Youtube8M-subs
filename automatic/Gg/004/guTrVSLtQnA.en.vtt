saying if you were going to purchase a
hard<00:00:30.840> drive<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.500> recommend<00:00:31.980> something

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
hard drive I would recommend something

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.170 
hard drive I would recommend something
that<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.870> seventy-two<00:00:33.870> hundred<00:00:34.260> rpms<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.180> ten

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that is seventy-two hundred rpms or ten

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.410 
that is seventy-two hundred rpms or ten
thousand<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.980> should<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.579> least<00:00:38.610> five

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
thousand and it should be at least five

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
thousand and it should be at least five
hundred<00:00:39.450> gigabytes<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.680> recommend<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> terabyte

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
hundred gigabytes I recommend a terabyte

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.999 
keep your project files on your C Drive
and<00:01:50.549> use<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.689> second<00:01:52.020> drive<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:52.590> export

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and use your second drive as your export

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.940 
and use your second drive as your export
drive<00:01:54.320> now<00:01:55.549> if<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:57.299> using<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.719> laptop<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
drive now if you're using a laptop and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
drive now if you're using a laptop and
you<00:01:59.759> only<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.060> hard<00:02:00.479> drive<00:02:00.630> first<00:02:00.990> I'd

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you only have one hard drive first I'd

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.940 
you only have one hard drive first I'd
check<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.159> laptop<00:02:02.520> even<00:02:03.500> has<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
check to see if your laptop even has a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
check to see if your laptop even has a
7200<00:02:05.909> rpm<00:02:06.299> hard<00:02:06.360> drive<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> lot<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
7200 rpm hard drive I know a lot of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.210 
7200 rpm hard drive I know a lot of
older<00:02:08.009> laptops<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.959> 54<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.950> even

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
older laptops do not like 54 or even

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.040 
older laptops do not like 54 or even
either<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> last<00:02:11.790> 4500<00:02:12.690> or<00:02:12.780> something

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
either the last 4500 or something

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.350 
either the last 4500 or something
so<00:02:15.050> what<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:15.980> would<00:02:16.070> do<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.400> check<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.760> see<00:02:16.910> what

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
so what I would do is check to see what

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.480 
so what I would do is check to see what
the<00:02:17.390> speed<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.750> maybe<00:02:18.530> even<00:02:18.800> possibly<00:02:19.070> think

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
the speed is maybe even possibly think

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.460 
the speed is maybe even possibly think
about<00:02:19.550> upgrading<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.330> 7,200<00:02:21.020> rpms<00:02:21.350> which

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
about upgrading it to 7,200 rpms which

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.610 
about upgrading it to 7,200 rpms which
