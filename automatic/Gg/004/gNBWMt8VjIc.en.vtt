to actually make that jump to PC is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
to actually make that jump to PC is
pretty<00:01:23.640> damn<00:01:23.939> cool<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> netcode

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
pretty damn cool it's got the netcode

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.170

and<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> infrastructure

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and it's kind of got the infrastructure

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
and it's kind of got the infrastructure
that's<00:01:27.330> needed<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.740> would<00:01:28.860> be

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that's needed to do so so that would be

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.609 
that's needed to do so so that would be
amazing<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.939> an<00:01:30.060> awesome<00:01:30.180> idea

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
but what actually interested me even

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
but what actually interested me even
more<00:01:42.659> was<00:01:42.899> hearing<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> Tekken<00:01:43.680> 7<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.220> going

installment of the Tekken or the Mishima
saga<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:50.159> seems<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> neat<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.299> kind

of interesting how they're choosing to
end<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.130> completely<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.240> means<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.630> we're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
end it completely that means that we're

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
end it completely that means that we're
gonna<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.470> crazy<00:01:55.710> stuff<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gonna get a lot of crazy stuff that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130 
gonna get a lot of crazy stuff that
culminates<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.030> big<00:01:57.270> thing<00:01:57.509> story<00:01:57.869> wise

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
culminates to one big thing story wise

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
culminates to one big thing story wise
but<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:58.890> does<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> mean<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.369> far<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.820> game

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
but what does it mean as far as the game

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
but what does it mean as far as the game
which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.049> most<00:02:01.079> curious<00:02:01.680> about

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
which is what I'm the most curious about

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
which is what I'm the most curious about
what<00:02:02.670> does<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> mean<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.149> far<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.360> characters

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
what does it mean as far as characters

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.170 
what does it mean as far as characters
are<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.590> those<00:02:04.740> gigantic<00:02:05.340> 45

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
something that's more focused isn't

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.250 
something that's more focused isn't
going<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> reboot<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.050> more<00:02:15.230> I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
going to be a reboot and the more I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.870 
going to be a reboot and the more I
thought<00:02:15.560> about<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.010> more<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.280> was<00:02:16.459> talking

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
thought about it the more I was talking

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.370 
thought about it the more I was talking
with<00:02:17.000> people<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.600> were<00:02:17.720> thinking<00:02:18.020> about

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
with people and we were thinking about

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.140 
with people and we were thinking about
what<00:02:18.620> Tekken<00:02:18.980> could<00:02:19.130> potentially<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.790> even

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
what Tekken could potentially be even

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.730 
what Tekken could potentially be even
with<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.420> Tekken<00:02:20.780> fans<00:02:21.080> guys<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.650> really

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
with like Tekken fans guys that really

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.770 
with like Tekken fans guys that really
liked<00:02:22.100> Tekken<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.700> have<00:02:23.090> kind<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.360> fallen<00:02:23.510> by

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
liked Tekken and have kind of fallen by

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.570 
liked Tekken and have kind of fallen by
the<00:02:23.810> wayside<00:02:24.080> over<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> past<00:02:24.830> few<00:02:25.040> iterations

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
the wayside over the past few iterations

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.880 
the wayside over the past few iterations
of<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> series<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.600> Tekken<00:02:26.900> 6<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.440> Tekken<00:02:27.709> 7

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
of the series with Tekken 6 and Tekken 7

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.070 
of the series with Tekken 6 and Tekken 7
and<00:02:28.220> I'm<00:02:28.610> with<00:02:28.820> these<00:02:28.970> dudes<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.690> really

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and I'm with these dudes I was really

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.470 
and I'm with these dudes I was really
into<00:02:30.320> tech<00:02:30.500> enough<00:02:30.800> until<00:02:31.040> Tekken<00:02:31.400> 5<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.000> for

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
into tech enough until Tekken 5 and for

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.090 
into tech enough until Tekken 5 and for
a<00:02:32.510> long<00:02:32.780> time<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.560> fighting<00:02:33.800> game

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
a long time it was the fighting game

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.830 
a long time it was the fighting game
that<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.280> was<00:02:34.459> into<00:02:34.790> even<00:02:35.090> more<00:02:35.360> than<00:02:35.540> Street

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that I was into even more than Street

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.720 
that I was into even more than Street
Fighter<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.380> since<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.980> series<00:02:37.310> has<00:02:37.459> kind<00:02:37.640> of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
Fighter and since the series has kind of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.370 
Fighter and since the series has kind of
fallen<00:02:38.030> off<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.300> interest<00:02:38.600> level<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.170> lot

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
fallen off the interest level of a lot

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.630 
fallen off the interest level of a lot
of<00:02:39.410> us<00:02:39.650> we<00:02:39.830> were<00:02:39.950> thinking<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.340> what<00:02:40.520> they

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
of us we were thinking of what they

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.520 
of us we were thinking of what they
could<00:02:40.790> potentially<00:02:41.270> do<00:02:41.450> with<00:02:41.600> Tekken<00:02:41.810> 7<00:02:42.140> and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
could potentially do with Tekken 7 and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.229 
could potentially do with Tekken 7 and
like<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:42.980> was<00:02:43.130> saying<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> more<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.940> thought

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
like I was saying the more I thought

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.030 
like I was saying the more I thought
about<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.840> more<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.500> getting<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.890> hint

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
about it the more I was getting a hint

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.040 
about it the more I was getting a hint
that<00:02:46.130> Tekken<00:02:46.700> 7<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.239> probably<00:02:47.570> just<00:02:47.840> going<00:02:47.989> to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
that Tekken 7 is probably just going to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.949 
that Tekken 7 is probably just going to
be<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.380> further<00:02:48.920> expansion<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.180> Tekken<00:02:50.600> 6

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
be a further expansion of the Tekken 6

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.140 
be a further expansion of the Tekken 6
engine<00:02:51.739> all<00:02:52.100> things<00:02:52.580> considered<00:02:52.940> they

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
engine all things considered they

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.430 
engine all things considered they
probably<00:02:53.390> don't<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.840> build<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.230> entire

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
probably don't want to build this entire

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.100 
probably don't want to build this entire
new<00:02:54.920> crazy<00:02:55.340> foundation<00:02:56.150> if<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:56.959> going

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
new crazy foundation if it's not going

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.870 
new crazy foundation if it's not going
to<00:02:57.230> go<00:02:57.440> anywhere<00:02:57.680> immediately<00:02:58.310> after<00:02:58.670> this

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
to go anywhere immediately after this

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.699 
to go anywhere immediately after this
but<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.510> wouldn't<00:02:59.840> be<00:02:59.989> surprised<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.560> they

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
but I wouldn't be surprised if they

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.199 
but I wouldn't be surprised if they
actually<00:03:01.100> make<00:03:01.400> something<00:03:01.820> immediately

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
actually make something immediately

Tekken<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.780> don't<00:03:48.079> think<00:03:48.350> we're<00:03:48.500> gonna<00:03:48.590> see

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
Tekken I don't think we're gonna see

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.610 
Tekken I don't think we're gonna see
anything<00:03:49.250> crazy<00:03:49.730> as<00:03:50.150> far<00:03:50.450> as<00:03:50.600> an<00:03:50.720> evolution<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
anything crazy as far as an evolution of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.770 
anything crazy as far as an evolution of
the<00:03:52.190> Tekken<00:03:52.610> engine<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.239> don't<00:03:53.269> think<00:03:53.630> this<00:03:53.750> is

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the Tekken engine I don't think this is

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.960 
the Tekken engine I don't think this is
going<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.079> be<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> reboot<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.160> don't<00:03:55.610> feel<00:03:55.790> like

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
going to be a reboot I don't feel like

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.580 
going to be a reboot I don't feel like
this<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.450> be<00:03:56.540> anything<00:03:57.049> different

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
this is going to be anything different

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.830 
this is going to be anything different
or<00:03:57.709> crazier<00:03:58.280> than<00:03:58.459> what<00:03:58.670> we're<00:03:58.850> used<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> with

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
or crazier than what we're used to with

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.870 
or crazier than what we're used to with
the<00:04:00.049> Tekken<00:04:00.410> 6<00:04:00.620> mechanics<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.549> Tekken

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
the Tekken 6 mechanics and the Tekken

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.000 
the Tekken 6 mechanics and the Tekken
Tag<00:04:02.060> Tournament<00:04:02.120> mechanics<00:04:03.019> I'm<00:04:03.470> pretty<00:04:03.829> sure

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
Tag Tournament mechanics I'm pretty sure

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.590 
Tag Tournament mechanics I'm pretty sure
it's<00:04:04.190> going<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.459> further<00:04:04.760> evolve<00:04:05.239> that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
it's going to further evolve that

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.539 
it's going to further evolve that
probably<00:04:06.290> make<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.590> even<00:04:06.829> maybe<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.160> little<00:04:07.430> bit

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
probably make it even maybe a little bit

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.310 
probably make it even maybe a little bit
more<00:04:07.820> complicated<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.660> really<00:04:09.049> cater

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
more complicated and really cater

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.680 
more complicated and really cater
towards<00:04:09.590> those<00:04:09.890> hardcore<00:04:10.250> players<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:11.060> don't

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
towards those hardcore players I don't

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.120 
towards those hardcore players I don't
know<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.959> feel<00:04:12.230> that's<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.680> way<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:12.950> will<00:04:13.070> go

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
know I feel that's the way it will go

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.770 
know I feel that's the way it will go
because<00:04:13.519> this<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.090> final<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:14.600> noir

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
because this is the final in noir

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.810 
because this is the final in noir
iteration<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.440> series<00:04:15.829> it's<00:04:16.280> essentially

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
iteration in the series it's essentially

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.580 
iteration in the series it's essentially
going<00:04:16.849> to<00:04:17.060> be<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.269> third<00:04:17.810> strike<00:04:18.289> of<00:04:18.530> the

more popular in general is potentially

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.710 
more popular in general is potentially

what Harada is working on outside of

what Harada is working on outside of
Tekken<00:04:46.080> 7<00:04:46.290> he<00:04:46.890> did<00:04:47.100> make<00:04:47.340> mention<00:04:47.640> that<00:04:47.910> he's

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
Tekken 7 he did make mention that he's

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.240 
Tekken 7 he did make mention that he's
working<00:04:48.300> on<00:04:48.510> two<00:04:48.720> other<00:04:48.960> fighting<00:04:49.290> games<00:04:49.620> not

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
working on two other fighting games not

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.060 
working on two other fighting games not
including<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.090> one<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:51.930> that's<00:04:52.140> three<00:04:52.500> total

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
including this one so that's three total

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.740 
including this one so that's three total
and<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.370> believe<00:04:53.730> one<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.240> other<00:04:54.390> ones<00:04:54.570> is

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
and I believe one of the other ones is

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.050 
and I believe one of the other ones is
most<00:04:55.320> likely<00:04:55.620> rise<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.220> incarnate<00:04:56.760> so<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.940> big

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
most likely rise of incarnate so the big

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.880 
most likely rise of incarnate so the big
arena<00:04:57.210> fighter<00:04:57.690> that's<00:04:57.930> similar<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.320> Gundam

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.610 
has offered over the 2d environment and
how<00:05:45.090> that<00:05:45.240> really<00:05:45.479> clashes<00:05:45.840> with<00:05:46.200> the<00:05:46.229> Tekken

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
how that really clashes with the Tekken

and<00:06:07.320> it's<00:06:07.440> freaking<00:06:07.919> gorgeous<00:06:08.190> then<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.330> can

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
and it's freaking gorgeous then it can

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.570

have<00:06:09.660> a<00:06:09.900> chance<00:06:10.229> of<00:06:10.410> selling<00:06:10.770> well<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.460> I

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
have a chance of selling well and I

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.860 
have a chance of selling well and I
think<00:06:11.820> that's<00:06:11.970> what<00:06:12.120> Tekken<00:06:12.450> needs<00:06:12.690> it<00:06:12.840> just

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
think that's what Tekken needs it just

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.380 
think that's what Tekken needs it just
needs<00:06:13.229> that<00:06:13.350> one<00:06:13.770> thing<00:06:14.160> that<00:06:14.400> Tekken<00:06:14.760> 3<00:06:14.790> and

needs that one thing that Tekken 3 and

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.810 
needs that one thing that Tekken 3 and
Tekken<00:06:15.720> 5<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.320> these<00:06:16.770> previous<00:06:17.310> games<00:06:17.580> had

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.969 
is still alive they still exist and they
still<00:06:56.539> remember<00:06:56.839> a<00:06:56.990> time<00:06:57.349> back<00:06:57.680> in<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:57.889> day

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
still remember a time back in the day

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.639 
still remember a time back in the day
where<00:06:58.729> Tekken<00:06:59.180> was<00:06:59.389> the<00:06:59.629> hottest<00:07:00.169> shit<00:07:00.349> on<00:07:00.529> the

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:00.649 
where Tekken was the hottest shit on the

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:03.070 
where Tekken was the hottest shit on the
planet<00:07:00.680> and<00:07:01.249> I<00:07:01.669> think<00:07:01.969> that<00:07:02.270> Namco<00:07:02.839> could

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
planet and I think that Namco could

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.689 
planet and I think that Namco could
potentially<00:07:03.589> grab<00:07:03.830> that<00:07:04.039> audience<00:07:04.430> once

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
potentially grab that audience once

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.730 
potentially grab that audience once
