00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
outer fabric here what we do is we'll be

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.450 
outer fabric here what we do is we'll be
cycling<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> roof<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.410> we<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:50.010> try<00:01:50.190> to<00:01:50.250> do

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
cycling the roof and we we try to do

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.310 
cycling the roof and we we try to do
this<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.790> an<00:01:50.880> accelerated<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> we'll

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this in an accelerated way so we'll

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.040 
this in an accelerated way so we'll
cycle<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> top<00:01:53.130> continuously<00:01:53.910> for<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.900> than

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
cycle the top continuously for more than

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
cycle the top continuously for more than
7500<00:01:55.860> cycles<00:01:56.310> which<00:01:56.750> represents<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:58.070> more

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
7500 cycles which represents what a more

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.040 
7500 cycles which represents what a more
severe<00:01:59.400> customer<00:01:59.910> would<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> 10-year

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
severe customer would do over a 10-year

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.680 
severe customer would do over a 10-year
life<00:02:01.260> of<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.500> car<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.400> we'll<00:02:03.210> repeat<00:02:03.510> that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
life of the car and we'll repeat that

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.630 
life of the car and we'll repeat that
multiple<00:02:04.140> lives<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> roof<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.520> get

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
multiple lives on a roof to get

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
multiple lives on a roof to get
statistical<00:02:06.450> significance<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.680> course

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
statistical significance and of course

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.469 
statistical significance and of course
when<00:02:08.100> we're<00:02:08.220> done<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.640> test<00:02:08.880> we<00:02:09.090> expect

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
when we're done with that test we expect

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.180 
when we're done with that test we expect
the<00:02:09.600> roof<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.990> look<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:10.410> did<00:02:10.590> before<00:02:10.920> we

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the roof to look as it did before we

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.820 
the roof to look as it did before we
started<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.610> test

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
started a test

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.290 
started a test
well<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:14.010> subject<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> car<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.270> of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
well we subject the car do a lot of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.120 
well we subject the car do a lot of
tests<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:15.840> noise<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.440> taking<00:02:16.830> lots<00:02:16.950> of
