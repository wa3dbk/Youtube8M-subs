00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.210 
second example of it but like long and
all<00:02:46.230> those<00:02:46.320> players<00:02:46.530> are<00:02:46.710> right<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> top<00:02:47.160> of

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
all those players are right the top of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.290 
all those players are right the top of
the<00:02:47.280> price<00:02:47.490> range<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.000> almost

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
the price range and it's almost

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.210 
the price range and it's almost
impossible<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:49.020> actually<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.710> yourself<00:02:50.040> one

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
impossible to actually get yourself one

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
impossible to actually get yourself one
which<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.970> ridiculous<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.630> how<00:02:51.900> can

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
which is just ridiculous like how can

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.600 
which is just ridiculous like how can
they<00:02:52.440> make<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.830> can't<00:02:53.040> get<00:02:53.160> Irish<00:02:53.340> players

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
they make it you can't get Irish players

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.420 
they make it you can't get Irish players
but<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.750> prizes<00:02:55.020> are<00:02:55.260> 20<00:02:55.710> k<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.130> one<00:02:56.340> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
but to the prizes are 20 k and one of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.340 
but to the prizes are 20 k and one of
the<00:02:56.520> untradeable<00:02:57.090> Keynes<00:02:57.360> online<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
the untradeable Keynes online and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.260 
the untradeable Keynes online and
offline<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.980> 10k<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.580> untradeable<00:03:00.060> keen

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
offline it's 10k and untradeable keen

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.220 
offline it's 10k and untradeable keen
I'm<00:03:00.420> not<00:03:00.570> sure<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.900> would<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:01.110> be<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
I'm not sure if that would just be the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.990 
I'm not sure if that would just be the
first<00:03:01.470> time<00:03:01.740> or<00:03:01.950> every<00:03:02.490> time<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.760> win<00:03:02.880> it

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
first time or every time you win it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.490 
first time or every time you win it
that'd<00:03:03.270> be<00:03:03.300> cool<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:03.960> I'm<00:03:04.050> definitely<00:03:04.230> going

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
that'd be cool but I'm definitely going

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.690 
that'd be cool but I'm definitely going
to<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.680> playing<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.040> tournament<00:03:05.430> tonight
