here in helping the student fire you
know<00:00:26.869> get<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.050> clarity<00:00:28.590> regarding<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:30.470> map

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
know get some clarity regarding that map

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
know get some clarity regarding that map
the<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> biggest<00:00:32.850> difficulty<00:00:33.750> is

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the the the the biggest difficulty is

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.139 
the the the the biggest difficulty is
getting<00:00:34.829> into<00:00:35.340> post-condition<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
getting into post-condition the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
getting into post-condition the
bottleneck<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> PG<00:00:37.440> level<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
bottleneck is at the PG level right that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
bottleneck is at the PG level right that
is<00:00:38.670> accepted<00:00:39.420> fact<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> not<00:00:40.320> going

be in the next couple of decades that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
be in the next couple of decades that
that<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> clear<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.670> government<00:01:06.090> policy<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that is clear the government policy is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
that is clear the government policy is
now<00:01:06.990> even<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.830> government<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> enact

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
now even if the government was to enact

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.539 
now even if the government was to enact
a<00:01:09.360> policy<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.770> take<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.130> least<00:01:11.159> two

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
a policy now it will take at least two

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
a policy now it will take at least two
decades<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.420> fructify<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.439> be

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
decades to really fructify so be

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
decades to really fructify so be

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
bottleneck at this level then if you

don't do some other questions are coming

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
don't do some other questions are coming
possibly<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.290> worried

that<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:26.939> PG<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that you're not going to get into PG so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
that you're not going to get into PG so
we<00:01:27.570> wanted<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.259> alternative<00:01:29.100> route

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490

we wanted to look for alternative route
you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:30.000> maybe<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.900> true<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:32.130> remember

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you know maybe that is true but remember

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.359 
you know maybe that is true but remember

the way the training is gone I might be

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
the way the training is gone I might be
really<00:01:44.189> abrasive<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.240> saying<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.020> that

is they're being inducted into the
hospitals<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.520> duty<00:02:14.790> doctors<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
hospitals as duty doctors that is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.770 
hospitals as duty doctors that is
happening<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:17.250> would<00:02:17.460> not<00:02:17.700> pay<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.060> more

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
happening so they would not pay you more

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.900 
happening so they would not pay you more
than<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> driver<00:02:19.440> salary<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.730> work

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
than a driver salary if you want to work

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.080 
than a driver salary if you want to work
in<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.300> hospital<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.100> fact<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.460> life<00:02:23.490> very

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
in a hospital that's a fact of life very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.550 
in a hospital that's a fact of life very
blunt<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.110> truth

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
blunt but that's the truth

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.740 
blunt but that's the truth
so<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.070> really<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.090> get<00:02:27.209> into<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.510> PG

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
so you really have to get into a PG

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.449 
so you really have to get into a PG

into<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> post-credit<00:02:35.430> training<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
into a post-credit training so the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.670 
into a post-credit training so the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
problem with this is the the generation

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.949 
problem with this is the the generation
is<00:02:40.890> about<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.370> same<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.910> guys<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> smart

changed you're as dedicated as we were
but<00:02:51.300> what<00:02:51.570> has<00:02:51.720> changed<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.350> volumes<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
but what has changed the volumes if the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
but what has changed the volumes if the
hard<00:02:54.360> presentation<00:02:55.020> speaks<00:02:55.470> about<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.920> the

hard presentation speaks about it the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000 
hard presentation speaks about it the

entire<00:03:18.120> metabolic<00:03:18.810> cycles<00:03:19.260> fifty<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.160> there

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
entire metabolic cycles fifty so there

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.009 
entire metabolic cycles fifty so there
is<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.640> much<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.030> has<00:03:21.150> come<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.660> about<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
is so much that has come in just about a

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.509 
is so much that has come in just about a
decade<00:03:22.260> how<00:03:22.560> are<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.799> going<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.040> keep<00:03:23.160> up<00:03:23.340> with

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
decade how are you going to keep up with

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.550 
decade how are you going to keep up with
that<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> same<00:03:24.989> thing<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.380> all

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that this is the same thing with all

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.130 
that this is the same thing with all
subjects<00:03:26.100> now<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.209> puts<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.690> lot<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.870> pressure

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
subjects now this puts a lot of pressure

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.400 
subjects now this puts a lot of pressure
right<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.640> where<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.480> really<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
right this is where you really have to

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.340 
right this is where you really have to
plan<00:03:31.980> things<00:03:32.340> ahead<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.700> time<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.350> interact

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
plan things ahead of time so interact

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.530 
plan things ahead of time so interact
with<00:03:34.590> your<00:03:34.769> faculty<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.820> best<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
with your faculty that is the best and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.620 
with your faculty that is the best and
the<00:03:36.750> first<00:03:37.080> important<00:03:37.739> step<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.630> second

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the first important step the second

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.830 
the first important step the second
thing<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.260> would<00:03:40.320> say<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.950> don't<00:03:41.940> believe<00:03:42.510> in

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
thing I would say is don't believe in

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.190 
thing I would say is don't believe in
successful<00:03:43.829> seniors<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.640> rather<00:03:44.880> learn<00:03:45.750> from

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
successful seniors you rather learn from

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.800 
three years of me coming back to India
that<00:05:41.260> I<00:05:41.320> talked<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:41.950> parent<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:43.180> was<00:05:43.420> not<00:05:43.630> the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
that I talked to a parent it was not the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.110 
that I talked to a parent it was not the
case<00:05:43.990> my<00:05:44.350> dad<00:05:44.620> came<00:05:45.040> and<00:05:45.100> talked<00:05:45.700> to<00:05:45.910> by

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
case my dad came and talked to by

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.390 
case my dad came and talked to by
professor<00:05:46.570> that's<00:05:46.720> when<00:05:46.870> Kumar<00:05:47.230> I<00:05:47.440> mean<00:05:48.160> that

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
professor that's when Kumar I mean that

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.070 
professor that's when Kumar I mean that
relation<00:05:48.970> is<00:05:49.090> completely<00:05:49.660> gone

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
relation is completely gone

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.600 
relation is completely gone
and<00:05:50.170> I<00:05:50.320> think<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.800> problem<00:05:51.250> is<00:05:51.370> more<00:05:51.550> with

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
and I think that problem is more with

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.660 
and I think that problem is more with
the<00:05:51.820> parents<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.420> the<00:05:52.570> faculty<00:05:53.380> faculty<00:05:53.920> even

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
the parents and the faculty faculty even

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.430 
the parents and the faculty faculty even
today<00:05:54.970> would<00:05:55.180> want<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.570> give<00:05:55.750> an<00:05:55.840> appointment

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
today would want to give an appointment

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.860 
today would want to give an appointment
for<00:05:56.770> 10<00:05:57.010> minutes<00:05:57.370> if<00:05:57.670> a<00:05:57.940> parent<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.480> going<00:05:58.750> to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
for 10 minutes if a parent is going to

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.100 
for 10 minutes if a parent is going to
come<00:05:59.110> and<00:05:59.230> talk<00:05:59.640> so<00:06:00.640> that<00:06:00.670> I<00:06:01.210> think<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.720> put<00:06:02.080> the

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
come and talk so that I think I put the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.990 
come and talk so that I think I put the
blame<00:06:02.350> squarely<00:06:02.410> on<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.250> parents<00:06:03.730> you<00:06:03.880> know

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
blame squarely on the parents you know

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.670 
blame squarely on the parents you know
they're<00:06:04.300> assuming<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.960> this<00:06:05.080> is<00:06:05.260> all<00:06:05.440> done

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
they're assuming that this is all done

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.620 
they're assuming that this is all done
see<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.490> is<00:06:06.610> not<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:06.820> case<00:06:07.120> you<00:06:07.360> know<00:06:07.480> it

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
see that is not the case you know it

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.480 
see that is not the case you know it
would<00:06:07.780> be<00:06:07.810> better<00:06:07.930> if<00:06:08.470> that<00:06:08.830> kind<00:06:09.040> of<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.310> system

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
would be better if that kind of a system

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.370 
would be better if that kind of a system
gets<00:06:09.910> integrated<00:06:10.270> you<00:06:10.810> know<00:06:10.960> starts

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
gets integrated you know starts

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.860 
gets integrated you know starts
somewhere<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.100> then<00:06:12.400> continues<00:06:12.940> I<00:06:13.210> think

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
somewhere and then continues I think

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.690 
somewhere and then continues I think
this<00:06:14.020> I<00:06:14.200> think<00:06:14.500> would<00:06:14.680> be<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.890> best<00:06:15.220> way<00:06:15.670> to

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
this I think would be the best way to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.300 
this I think would be the best way to
look<00:06:16.030> forward
