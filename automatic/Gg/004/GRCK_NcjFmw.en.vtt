00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.680

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.720

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.090
 scratch card to sell everywhere 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.950
 mainly on the beach but usually 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.680
 those carts sell with that 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.720
 artificial juices but here we go 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.650
 to prepare a natural juice of guava 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.690

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.360

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.980

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.840
 I'll put a little water 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.310
 this juice it stays a little bit longer 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.630
 concentrate because then it goes 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.720
 mix with ice 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 then you need to make a strong juice one 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.740
 little sugar not too much 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.490

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.009

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.649
