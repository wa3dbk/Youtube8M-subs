00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.869
 chocolate marvin 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 these are all ingredients for the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 in the description 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 I am going to start again more is of course 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.880
 we the three different types 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 chocolate and then be 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 dime bevis little to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 mother two ends 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 sunflower oil semi - skimmed milk flour and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.809
 baking powder and light brown caster sugar 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 skinny muffins is a breeze 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.930
 in fact it is only a matter 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.449
 throw all the ingredients together 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 she works it anyone can do it 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.500
 start again with dry 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.559
 ingredients so do the sugar and I come 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 and thereby I also add the baking powder and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.799
 Coming up dick and tasty there 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 also a pinch of salt by salt and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 chocolate go really well together 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.049
 and if you add a little salt to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.689
 recipes that also contain chocolate 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 booties chocolate taste that extra intention 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.939
 you want of course 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:30.210
 I add the cocoa powder and scoop this 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.009
 I with a wooden spoon just like that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.240
 put this aside for a moment and then you can 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.090
 in another I come the wet one 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 ingredients go together we mix 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.020
 you have another clean batter bowl and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.200
 I put all the notting spirit in there and that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.670
 are the oil in the milk 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 I already know that the questions get or 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 you can also use olive oil on it 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.979
 rather not olive oil has one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 taste and that also influences the taste 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.149
 of sunflower oil muffins has this 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.619
 you were not allowed to use sunflower oil 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.210
 home then you can have another 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.220
 neutral 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.570
 oil used like nice Jews 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.060
 for instance 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.360
 I also asked the ends 2 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.360
 pieces 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.350
 and with the whisk I knock this loose 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.420
 by each other 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.600
 so only a moment if it goes well with 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.069
 mixed together then finished the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.850
 comes with wet ingredients 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.440
 pushed aside 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.810
 then I take the dry bowl 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.340
 ingredients are added again and there 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 the wet ingredients may, by 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.940
 now you can mix the i with the mixes 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.890
 but I can't actually do that to you 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.660
 recommend because for muffins the how 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.910
 the longer you mix the drier the cake becomes 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.650
 is actually so I'm just this 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.360
 Stir with a wooden spoon in you 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.580
 see that we will soon be whole 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.640
 soon becomes a batter and you have to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.290
 actually really only a moment to 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.380
 ingredients in common 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.090
 then it is actually good as you see 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.090
 happens on thought very quickly 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.140
 look like that's actually good and now like 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.540
 last naturally sweet chocolate in there 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.690
 a trusted three types of pure milk 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.150
 white simply forms all in this 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.829
 we just put it around the corpse you 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.260
 him chocolate but well it's my birthday 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.610
 so I can 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.320
 all we have to do now 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.090
 is filling the muffin molds and the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.470
 start baking muffins 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.540
 and I've covered a muffin mold here 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.880
 with silicone shapes I am really a fan 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.320
 of silicone muffin molds because that 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.060
 you don't have to grease 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.040
 I usually do here in the muffins 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.709
 let them take out and bake in others 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.750
 put papers because then you have too 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.130
 just most still looked over with that 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.359
 paper molds remain looked at 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.829
 paste bayla 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.680
 clean not useful silicone mold 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.780
 real man i use two tablespoons 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.720
 and with that I just scoop the batter 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.370
 the molds and I do the molds delicious 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.080
 full because I like it as the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.350
 Muffins really travel really well 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.570
 really have such a beautiful high summit 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.790
 muffin molds are super full I have 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.470
 the oven preheated 180 degrees and now 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.700
 let's bake the muffins 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.080
 I do that in the middle of the oven and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.300
 I expect them to be around 20 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.930
 minutes ready they get this even bigger 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.269
 muffins 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 I just came across so she needs a moment 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.560
 let it cool down but I really can't 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.410
 waiting to try and see them really 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.000
 great and look really nice 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.340
 tasted exactly the same at the top 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.110
 I want them 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.900
 only part so but we'll go later 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.250
 tasting chocolate muffins and ham evening 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.320
 I secretly already have a little bit 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.480
 tasted others had to take pictures 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.950
 but of course still wanted to 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.000
 your relationship knew you something in one 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.560
 placed a sign 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.150
 as you see very beautiful dark 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.170
 and I have the silicone mold off 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.080
 achieved 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.170
 but look what it looks like inside 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.320
 really how do you do square when you do 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.000
 already looks a little chocolate now white 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.910
 chocolate is really a bit hard and too 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.640
 deep hour and milk are really melted them 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.250

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.419
