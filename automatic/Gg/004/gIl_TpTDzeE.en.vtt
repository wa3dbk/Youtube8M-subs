00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hey my name is babbel bonn and me 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.470
 Today we want to show you all over 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.260
 simple fashion three-dimensional 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.870
 You can do your own writing if you like 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
 have a punching machine you can do such 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.570
 Letters, of course, also by hand 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.640
 then they will naturally cut out 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.800
 not so filigree and as decorated as 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 this is the name of this run lettering 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 See how you see here I have the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 Letters all double out confessed that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 It's because I'm not fat 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 could find foam rubber 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 So I have a normal one 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 Moss rubber is what you get in each one 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.090
 can get a fab shop are normal 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.739
 I strengthen it about 1 millimeter 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 that he punched out twice and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.660
 then stick it with a normal whole 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.219
 normal glue together by war 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 Of course I double that strength 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.430
 double deep and I wanted it afterwards 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.070
 Next I use with the faber 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.199
 castell gel medium a napkin 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.859
 I have the fantastic of ikea here 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.870
 used 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.059
 They have four beds but I use 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.510
 here for gluing only a single location 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.040
 and if I have a stronger effect of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.750
 would like to have these values were then 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 I'll glue a second one after that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.049
 so always stick in layers 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.150
 if you give up the four at once 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.979
 would then it was shifted 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.960
 it does not stick properly gets messy 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640
 you may like to try but I do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.310
 always individually so and very much to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.520
 Finally, I have a situation here again 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.380
 individual glued on it as he can see 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.210
 these values â€‹â€‹pushed that together 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.210
 then gives such a nice klinkel 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.369
 structure of his fold structure and if 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.159
 the glue dried this game medium 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.150
 then that's also fixed and stays 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.150
 get you like that 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.330
 yes with the committee beautiful the reserved 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.129
 Stick around even unknown people 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.930
 and then you have a nice one too 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.450
 conclusion could yes that must then 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.239
 drying naturally and we do 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.640
 good luck with a movie here 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.420
 white guest comes to the whole 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.150
 of course dried that produces guests 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.459
 a so-called underground because we 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.739
 then work with renato colors 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.680
 I want and on the guest then I have 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.060
 virtually neutral underlay as you can see 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.590
 I always go with the brush in this 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.819
 Well in the lower end 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.109
 because the book comes because otherwise I if 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.120
 I apply too much paint one 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.069
 got such times, first 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.780
 they dry forever and three days very much 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.209
 slow and then he sees 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.900
 letter not so nice anymore 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.849
 three-dimensional if you like it everywhere 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.349
 that has got thick ink pots now 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.690
 of course complete again 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.720
 dried through and now I work 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.489
 with the pilatus the color I want 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.549
 now in the first step only once 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.829
 Its delicate gradient produce to it 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.000
 I wear the nato a bit and 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:23.450
 Smudge then distribute it with 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.389
 wet wipes i say to it without oil it 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.709
 are probably baby wipes with oil but 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.060
 I never work with oil I always work 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.129
 with wet wipes or with these 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 cleaning cloths that is conceivable for me 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.720
 what you take there is just one 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.690
 is a bit damp and with this 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.489
 this theme is the color of the people 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.769
 very very well distributed and also 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.419
 very even and very tender and man 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.430
 if you apply too much paint 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.099
 always has something to take away and then 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.930
 a very delicate weddings paint applicator 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.930
 generate and color gradients too 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.730
 Next, I want the senator 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.410
 Use color as a kind of water color 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.860
 I'll give it a bit about that now 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.150
 open tile and water is added here 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.340
 in this spray bottle is just 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.800
 tap water and wear with a 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.670
 brush in the edges so you see 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.500
 it's a bit like that here too 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.660
 the difference in the application on the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.340
 I have weighted it and now 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.840
 to create the shadow and right in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.190
 the edges of these letters too 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.700
 they are very very close and very 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.320
 recessed 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.760
 I did not even get in with the pen 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.230
 and not with your finger around 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.570
 I'm gonna go with that 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.490
 brush so the line color is suitable 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.830
 for many areas of application and 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.630
 then you have to look with which 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.890
 tool and what technique here 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.900
 occurs and so you can always again 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.400
 achieve completely different effects 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.590
 now here it really has one 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.270
 to the right shadow effects thereby 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.890
 then my writing will be easy too 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.890
 again a bit 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.890
 three-dimensional 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.980
 if that then everything dried again 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.020
 I'll just go with me now 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.060
 finger over these you fold yes 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.950
 previously glued together so here 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.870
 I can see then with the singer 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.120
 I write the color only on the 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.710
 elevated parts yes and that comes 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.390
 then fold this structure again 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.100
 On the whole, that's a lot stronger 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.200
 nice project for someone to be fond of 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.180
 has or for Valentine's Day or for a 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.370
 wedding yes if you are such a 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.040
 wanted to give away trivia or with 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.870
 the picture then still coupons or 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.420
 give something for the young couple 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.950
 wanted and it is easy to do it yourself 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.580
 you do not need much and that 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.460
 materials are very cheap and me 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.110
 Hope you liked it and you leave 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.950
 encourage you and then do that 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.950
 sometimes even after
