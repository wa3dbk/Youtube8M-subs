00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
for the most part you know it's pretty

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.859

fun<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.100> when<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:33.090> ghosts<00:01:33.690> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
fun but when we get to ghosts and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.139 
fun but when we get to ghosts and
advanced<00:01:34.380> warfare<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.890> tend<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.190> skip<00:01:35.490> those<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
advanced warfare we tend to skip those I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.180 
advanced warfare we tend to skip those I
don't<00:01:37.080> really<00:01:37.170> enjoy<00:01:37.380> those<00:01:37.740> games<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.040> much

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
don't really enjoy those games that much

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.180 
don't really enjoy those games that much
actually<00:01:38.430> ghost<00:01:39.149> i<00:01:39.440> would<00:01:40.440> say<00:01:40.649> ghosts<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
actually ghost i would say ghosts I

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.820 
actually ghost i would say ghosts I
think<00:01:42.410> unfortunately<00:01:43.410> some<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> aren't

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
think unfortunately some of you aren't

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.200 
think unfortunately some of you aren't
going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.550> think<00:01:44.970> advanced

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
going to like this I think advanced

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.880 
going to like this I think advanced
warfare<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.720> probably<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> worst<00:01:46.289> god<00:01:46.679> we've

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
warfare is probably the worst god we've

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
warfare is probably the worst god we've
had<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:47.280> far<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> guys<00:01:48.690> know<00:01:48.929> how<00:01:49.080> much<00:01:49.140> I
