00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.040
 and michele rizzi the fifth candidate for president of the province of 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.069
 barletta andria trani supported by the communist alternative party since 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.270
 anti-racist party from the anti-war movement from the anti-war movement 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.290
 and for the public school and the unemployed and precarious movement 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.770
 rizia reaffirmed its commitment in the political and social sphere to vote to build 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.300
 a class left that does not betray the interests of precarious workers 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 of women of the unemployed and immigrants and I am a worker 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.109
 barrel and jobs precarious does not allow those who are more than me 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:38.269
 by grandmother socio-economic crisis situation of capitalism and 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.629
 obviously also a situation that affects precarious workers who 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 they lose their jobs every day we want to build a left of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 alternative we want to give the idea of ​​a left. who did not betray he had 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.559
 experiences of the left which state government and has clearly failed we propose 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.869
 of programmatic points pension programmatic points nine 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.590
 therefore anti-capitalist addition here no real left admission 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.160
 that it is on the side but in the facts of workers and temporary workers 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.440
 we know that there are companies here in barletta that have closed but many 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.820
 Many entrepreneurial companies have truly transferred cars all over the world 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 I remain on the other side of the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.980
 Adriatic 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.720
 we know that it is a lot of money that the community has paid and these 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.800
 workers are out of work we say these factories must be 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.920
 managed by workers we ask for a social income for the unemployed and 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.730
 precarious that we ask for a new house plan that we will obviously welcome if 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.730
 we should enter the provincial council 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.570
 a house plan that provides housing for poor people who are indebted to them 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 mortgages and then can no longer cope with precisely or at these costs 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.810
 reason why the left-wing air shows up in increased taxes 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.110
 in order not to risk cody it also undermines the communist project itself of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.339
 which guy site details high prophet vc 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.750
 but in fact I am the only candidate on the left 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 to the presidency and not a group, the other parties were so right-wing 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.390
 governments know that we have agreements everywhere with the pb ascierto another way we have 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.750
 precisely called the unity of the left alternative hd forces have chosen it 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.230
 to be with the democratic party in Italy and in the local councils 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.480
 represents other interests we have seen with the brave government we put it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.040
 with all the other previous center-left governments if it were to arrive at 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.140
 provincial council with the however you will then be called to tighten 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.279
 alliances 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.290
 but surely now 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.390
 we cont we are a very clear idea we believe local governments and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.309
 national interests represent class interests 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:02.029
 among other things, a government of Salerno with you say that it certainly does not represent the 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:02.839
 left 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:07.009
 given the position of cassini with respect to the englaro house, for example it was 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.739
 a free therefore democratic battle 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.549
 eh cassini sided with the other side and sided with the 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.959
 ecclesiastical hierarchies not for a fundamental right 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.459
 having regard to the center-left alliance with marble pina that does not represent 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.329
 certainly how to say a left base 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.569
 seen ooh that other the other deployments that we have in the field 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.599
 we represent a single id on the left and we will represent it in the council 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.150
 provincial to the position of any government should be formed
