00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.020
 with cars m2 to a new video is 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.330
 basically a pretty news 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.849
 interesting that really does not stop 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.280
 to be funny at the same time many 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.009
 things get carried away like that 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.720
 say it no longer the rumors but what 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.060
 third a battlefield dinosaurs mode 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 3 in which you know that this this is not 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.000
 comes from now this comes from almost 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.800
 shortly after being the game I would say 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.420
 even before not in a trailer where 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.820
 you saw basically a man that 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.169
 I was holding a toy not a 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.230
 toy dinosaur that basically 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.630
 then he explained dais that basically what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.970
 what was it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 a toy of his son what he wanted 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.150
 to remember to scream and I do not know what else 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.620
 let history I will put a 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.640
 new dinosaur that that was not for 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 nothing an this that they are going to put that and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.230
 yesterday I do not want it from the mode of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.810
 those now have been growing and growing 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.760
 decreasing dinosaur basically to 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.340
 that does not know it would not be a way 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.780
 zombie like in the case of last but I 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.120
 of zombies by the new dinosaur 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.540
 survival style 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.220
 in the maps that come then dinosaurs 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.400
 and basically because we have to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.650
 defend cooperatively good yesterday 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.720
 They resurfaced those desires one 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.490
 user by radio this asked in the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 official twitter of battlefield 3 were going to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.290
 put I do not know if he knew how 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.960
 dinosaur 4 filter if you answer what 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 next they said no at this time 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.229
 there is not a single word of the dlc of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.869
 dinosaur you want one in the shape of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.140
 question and if so, it would be the beings 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.070
 humans versus the dinosaurs 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.539
 basically with logically if they would be 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.619
 humans but sure it opened you 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.929
 they will not be happy all of me really 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.369
 well that had a lot of challenges and they continue 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.740
 if sumo favorite was an amazing thing 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.690
 in fact dedicated forums as they tried 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 make a hashtag on twitter not putting 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:02:00.210
 pff 3 tell us what would be battlefield 3 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:03.030
 tell us if you want it is not served 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.310
 it serves as something that is trending topics 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.539
 I believe that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.849
 I think you give I do not know if I say it 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.680
 I've seen all kinds comments I 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.270
 seen comments of the premium note 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.120
 just for that 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.870
 because really yesterday was a good yesterday 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.850
 and today 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.550
 pages that they just look at these 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.990
 news from the first ones really like 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.340
 it caught my attention, it's not going to 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.030
 do the video because I really own 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.220
 something 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.100
 secondary therefore somehow not a 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.950
 twee answered like this but it's 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.350
 that the desire for this does not come being no 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.060
 it's been little, not really, 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.920
 comes from a long time ago and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.220
 right now it is, as I say 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.240
 being this I know that from there I do not have 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.490
 constancy or what 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.110
 today is electronic result constancy 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.480
 of this really seems very stupid to me 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.340
 when that you just have to put a little 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.750
 on the internet to see it not only do you have a 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.310
 debate the dinosaurs filter and the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.770
 anxiety come out or even when it was the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.370
 boom this because you can quickly 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.700
 well 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.090
 things came out and I think you give you know 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.060
 I think the tone is well aware not 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.319
 there are three more times to come out 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.299
 in battlefield 3 1 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.480
 armor is quilca basically it will be 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.480
 tanks and such another is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.340
 in games and others will be end formats 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.400
 game basically what is known is that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.670
 you will have vehicles as well as motorcycles and such 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.349
 and the aftermath is basically the one 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.510
 least it is known that I know at least 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.360
 they do not say many things I know that 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.400
 us in that map pack is not going to 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.989
 see but maybe something secondary 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.340
 it may be we do not already know that four 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.650
 maps where you do not stay in the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.590
 fourth it is said that after more can do 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.470
 Noise maps can be maps after 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.060
 of an earthquake after such and even 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.610
 they could be maps where there are earthquakes 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:03.260
 in game or some kind of catastrophes 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.880
 in fact I think he survives 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.040
 of the thermal card 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.870
 I do not think there are dinosaurs in this way 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.090
 it is possible that if it is possible that 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.630
 As I say, there are few official things 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.579
 that pact maps in game that are needed 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.489
 basically those that will be of 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.470
 vehicles and such but 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.780
 it could be that doing wrong was the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.940
 special operations of some kind of 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.669
 things and one of them to overcome this 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.680
 Although I doubt it very much, I think that I 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.770
 I think the dinosaur mode of getting 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.379
 would get in like that 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.930
 no surprise when that you wait for 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.750
 surprise without announcing yet decide 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.199
 for all the players prize not 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.180
 special offer or something like that or that the most 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.699
 It's probably what I'm going to say 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.800
 I really am that I'm almost 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.539
 sure almost convinced or is a 90 for 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.789
 a hundred of me tell me that it's going to be that 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.400
 that they are not going to put it in battlefield 3 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.669
 and that I have them talking or to beat 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.680
 phil 4 or for bad company 3 and I would say 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.599
 amateur phil 4 and I would say for next 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.330
 generation and I would say a way that you 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.860
 shit you really taino silly know that it is 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.030
 direct competition from the zombie mode of 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.690
 call of duty and it would work very well 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.430
 it would work very well because it is 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.289
 watching the forums and such because I think 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.960
 what do you want to ignore all this 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.279
 electronic arts wants to leave 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.020
 all this abandon all sensitivity 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.819
 that people forget because they are not going to 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.339
 be in battlefield 3 and I what 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.659
 I bet because a phil 4 toilet is the 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.759
 way of nosa obriga I know it's fuck 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.400
 a lot of marrana say this and not say 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.100
 by itself there is going to be no 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.690
 I think they spend more on butterfield 4 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.449
 and we forgot battlefield 3 because 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.690
 the hotels that are really not there 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.729
 pinta does not look like it does not look like 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.430
 go to be in saurian mode like this 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.370
 that good came further from trying 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.630
 up the rumors and such an attempt tried 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.490
 silence them at first I do that 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.090
 I thought he was going to put on but 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.610
 at the end, not at the end, nothing else is 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.259
 put what you think surely is the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.449
 Most of you want a mode of 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.250
 saurios that is very clear to put the 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.710
 comments would like or not to me really 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.770
 fuck i would love would be the host 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.509
 generally on a map and large 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.960
 dinosaurs and such power to kill them and all 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.520
 these things but it seems that it's not good 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.770
 kids this has been all about we're not going 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.770
 in the next video until the next top
