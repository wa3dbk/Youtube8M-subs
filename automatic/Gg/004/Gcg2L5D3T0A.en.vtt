00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
DSLR video you know how students start

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.960 
DSLR video you know how students start
in<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.349> photography<00:00:10.769> school<00:00:11.340> they're<00:00:11.610> given<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.970 
in a photography school they're given a

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.140 
in a photography school they're given a
35<00:00:12.450> millimeter<00:00:12.960> lens<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> told<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:14.910> can't

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
35 millimeter lens and told they can't

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.210 
35 millimeter lens and told they can't
shoot<00:00:15.389> with<00:00:15.540> anything<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.590> until<00:00:17.070> they

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
shoot with anything but that until they

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.430 
shoot with anything but that until they
learn<00:00:17.430> how<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.760> make<00:00:18.330> good<00:00:18.539> photographs<00:00:19.080> with

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
learn how to make good photographs with

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.460 
learn how to make good photographs with
the<00:00:19.590> 35<00:00:20.010> millimeter<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.910> that's<00:00:21.869> pretty

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the 35 millimeter because that's pretty

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.460 
the 35 millimeter because that's pretty
close<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> human<00:00:23.550> eye<00:00:23.670> sees<00:00:24.410> well<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
close to what the human eye sees well I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.080 
close to what the human eye sees well I
was<00:00:25.590> talking<00:00:25.770> with<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.130> photographer<00:00:26.880> friend

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
was talking with a photographer friend

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179 
was talking with a photographer friend
of<00:00:27.269> mine<00:00:27.390> recently<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.289> she<00:00:28.619> wanted<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> know

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
of mine recently and she wanted to know

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.209 
of mine recently and she wanted to know
what<00:00:29.730> was<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> equivalent<00:00:30.740> for<00:00:31.740> audio

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
what was the equivalent for audio

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
what was the equivalent for audio
recording<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.389> a<00:00:33.420> 35<00:00:33.989> millimeter<00:00:34.499> lens

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
recording is there a 35 millimeter lens

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.819 
recording is there a 35 millimeter lens
for<00:00:35.639> audio<00:00:35.909> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.839> had<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.199> think<00:00:37.319> about<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.649> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
for audio and I had to think about it a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
for audio and I had to think about it a
good<00:00:37.979> bit<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.519> what<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.789> came<00:00:38.909> up<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.479> was

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
good bit but what I came up with was

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.549 
good bit but what I came up with was
that<00:00:40.289> there<00:00:40.499> is<00:00:40.679> it's<00:00:41.069> the<00:00:41.339> lavalier<00:00:41.639> and<00:00:42.559> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that there is it's the lavalier and the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
that there is it's the lavalier and the
reason<00:00:43.889> for<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.069> is<00:00:44.429> that<00:00:44.460> when<00:00:45.089> you're

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
reason for that is that when you're

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.809 
reason for that is that when you're
shooting<00:00:45.479> people<00:00:46.109> who<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.649> talking<00:00:46.949> the

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
shooting people who are talking the

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.959 
shooting people who are talking the
lavalier<00:00:48.209> is<00:00:48.659> the<00:00:49.079> standard<00:00:49.649> way<00:00:50.159> of<00:00:50.190> getting

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
lavalier is the standard way of getting

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.029 
lavalier is the standard way of getting
the<00:00:51.239> sound<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.170> even<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.679> a<00:00:52.709> sound

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the sound and even if you have a sound

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.449 
the sound and even if you have a sound
guy<00:00:53.369> with<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.909> boom<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.139> a<00:00:55.289> shotgun<00:00:55.979> mic<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:56.459 
guy with a boom and a shotgun mic the

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:59.479 
guy with a boom and a shotgun mic the
chances<00:00:56.909> are<00:00:57.030> good<00:00:57.209> he's<00:00:57.929> gonna<00:00:58.139> put<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.440> lob<00:00:58.709> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
chances are good he's gonna put a lob on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.509 
chances are good he's gonna put a lob on
your<00:01:00.029> talent<00:01:00.479> to<00:01:00.869> get<00:01:01.019> both<00:01:01.529> that<00:01:01.799> sound<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
we're gonna use this mic and we're gonna
compare<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> sin<00:01:55.740> Houser

gonna step up to four feet away so this
is<00:03:59.380> how<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.560> sound<00:03:59.920> from<00:04:00.220> four<00:04:00.430> feet<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.940> the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
is how I sound from four feet and the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.500 
is how I sound from four feet and the
shotgun<00:04:01.510> mic<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.880> can<00:04:04.030> hear<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.299> room

shotgun mic and you can hear the room
how<00:04:04.930> much<00:04:05.139> quieter<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.579> haven't

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
how much quieter that is I haven't

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.610 
how much quieter that is I haven't
changed<00:04:07.180> anything<00:04:07.540> on<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.049> levels<00:04:08.380> these<00:04:08.560> are

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
changed anything on the levels these are

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.750 
changed anything on the levels these are
still<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.040> same<00:04:10.109> stepping<00:04:11.109> up<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.350> two<00:04:11.500> feet

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.060 

that's<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.810> shotgun<00:04:17.230> mic<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.769> hear

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
that's the the shotgun mic you can hear

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.860 
that's the the shotgun mic you can hear
that's<00:04:18.310> about<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.820> distance<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.600> most

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
that's about the distance that most

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.569 
that's about the distance that most
shotgun<00:04:20.350> mics<00:04:20.620> are<00:04:20.950> when<00:04:21.220> they're<00:04:21.400> being

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
shotgun mics are when they're being

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.790 
shotgun mics are when they're being
worked<00:04:21.850> by<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.240> boom<00:04:22.780> operator<00:04:22.990> that's<00:04:23.590> about

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
worked by a boom operator that's about

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.500 
worked by a boom operator that's about
as<00:04:23.980> close<00:04:24.010> as<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.640> get<00:04:24.820> it's<00:04:25.120> about<00:04:25.150> two

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
as close as you can get it's about two

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.130 
as close as you can get it's about two
feet<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:27.030> then<00:04:28.030> I'll<00:04:28.150> step<00:04:28.390> up<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.690> one<00:04:28.720> foot

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
feet and then I'll step up to one foot

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.650 
feet and then I'll step up to one foot
just<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.680> can<00:04:29.860> have<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:31.330> sound<00:04:33.600> okay<00:04:34.600> so

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
just so you can have that sound okay so

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.820 
just so you can have that sound okay so
this<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.350> me<00:04:36.510> yeah<00:04:37.510> right<00:04:37.810> at<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.200> foot<00:04:38.620> from

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
this is me yeah right at one foot from

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.200 
this is me yeah right at one foot from

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
the mic and that's the end of this test

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.820 
the mic and that's the end of this test
that<00:04:43.390> should<00:04:43.630> give<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:43.960> good<00:04:44.140> idea<00:04:44.170> on<00:04:44.650> how

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
distance that most shotgun mics are when

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.630 
distance that most shotgun mics are when
they're<00:05:22.840> being<00:05:23.020> worked<00:05:23.229> by<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.680> boom<00:05:24.220> operator

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
they're being worked by a boom operator

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.490 
they're being worked by a boom operator
that's<00:05:25.000> about<00:05:25.240> as<00:05:25.419> close<00:05:25.450> as<00:05:25.840> you<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.080> get<00:05:26.260> is

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
that's about as close as you can get is

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.130 
that's about as close as you can get is
about<00:05:26.710> two<00:05:26.950> feet<00:05:27.390> one<00:05:28.390> other<00:05:28.570> thing<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.870> wanted

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
about two feet one other thing I wanted

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.050 
about two feet one other thing I wanted
to<00:05:29.200> do<00:05:29.410> was<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.860> give<00:05:30.010> you<00:05:30.100> some<00:05:30.310> idea<00:05:30.669> of<00:05:30.850> what

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
to do was to give you some idea of what

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.600 
to do was to give you some idea of what
the<00:05:31.330> rogue<00:05:31.810> videomic<00:05:32.470> sounds<00:05:32.950> like<00:05:33.100> going<00:05:33.460> in

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
the rogue videomic sounds like going in

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.240 
the rogue videomic sounds like going in
directly<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.960> zoom<00:05:35.229> and<00:05:35.470> that's<00:05:36.070> what

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
directly to the zoom and that's what

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.930 
directly to the zoom and that's what
this<00:05:36.400> sound<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.890> mic<00:05:39.220> is<00:05:39.250> going<00:05:39.790> directly

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
this sound is this mic is going directly

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.320 
this sound is this mic is going directly
into<00:05:40.270> this<00:05:41.229> recorder<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.910> sounds<00:05:43.180> pretty

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
into this recorder and it sounds pretty

see that I have the zoom is on a little

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.360 
see that I have the zoom is on a little
gorilla<00:05:49.150> pod<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.840> that's<00:05:50.530> really<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.860> handy

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
gorilla pod and that's really a handy

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.490 
gorilla pod and that's really a handy
device<00:05:51.490> because<00:05:52.060> that<00:05:52.240> lets<00:05:52.450> you<00:05:52.600> set<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.470> down

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
device because that lets you set it down

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
you can mount it on different things and

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.380 
you can mount it on different things and
it'll<00:05:55.840> stay<00:05:56.169> pretty<00:05:56.380> well<00:05:56.590> where<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.830> put<00:05:57.100> it

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390

I'm also gonna pull the plug here and

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.770 
I'm also gonna pull the plug here and
now<00:06:02.919> this<00:06:03.250> is<00:06:03.430> just<00:06:03.640> the<00:06:03.910> sound<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.390> the<00:06:04.450> zoom

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
now this is just the sound of the zoom

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.560

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.719 
that are really pretty good and one of
the<00:06:11.350> things<00:06:11.560> I<00:06:11.710> like<00:06:11.919> about<00:06:11.950> it<00:06:12.220> you<00:06:12.400> can<00:06:12.520> hear

the things I like about it you can hear

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.930 
the things I like about it you can hear
as<00:06:12.820> I<00:06:12.910> turn<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.330> mic<00:06:13.540> away<00:06:13.720> from<00:06:14.050> me<00:06:14.229> here<00:06:14.940> is

as I turn the mic away from me here is

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.900 
as I turn the mic away from me here is
that<00:06:16.570> it<00:06:16.960> is<00:06:17.110> a<00:06:17.140> stereo<00:06:17.500> mic<00:06:17.890> but<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.490> can<00:06:18.640> set

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
that it is a stereo mic but you can set

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.060 
that it is a stereo mic but you can set
it<00:06:19.030> up<00:06:19.150> so<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.540> it<00:06:19.840> picks<00:06:20.020> up<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.440> front<00:06:20.650> and

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
it up so that it picks up the front and

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.620
