 the goods are obtained and then 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.819
 mixing these four ingredients you 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:20.019
 get in front and rod color

 a pencil 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.499
 All these ingredients fall asleep silva one

 shuffle penetrate each other 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.290
 the resulting mixture resembling 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.560
 pasta 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.560
 lay the next car where 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.250
 she complex for big 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.960
 hydraulic cylinders 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.410
 this machine is like a big media vacuum 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.160
 after exhausting air mass 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.120
 becomes homogeneous 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 turns into one big round course 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.700
 hydraulic motor pushes this one 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 block through the little holes of power and 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 one and a half thousand pounds per square inch 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.810
 and on the other hand the viewers appear 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 pencils 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.250
 at the end a little pruned 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.170
 and they drink it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.090
 special pockets 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.660
 each pocket add a little 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.660
 chalk to prevent viewers from sticking together 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.780
 pockets shuffled on 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.700
 special krutilki and here begins 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 drying process after 15 minutes is similar 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.490
 wiretapping David Villa send in the oven 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.580
 Gomes already at 3 o'clock at a temperature of 115 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.620
 at the final grid stage or are placed in 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.180
 melted bosco solution 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.010
 kia cracks in still 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.720
 precisely because of this stage

 california theater 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.630
 one of them is made the basis for a pencil 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.189
 the blade cuts the core and top 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.189

 after you with them already on the next 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.919
 the car is rounded and here 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.129

 a layer of nitrocellulose while Russian calves are behind 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.819
 once this machine can pay 1440 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.620
 pencils on average per day through it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.150
 passes

 about thirty thousand pencils 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.589
 after the pencils were 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:31.689
 sharpened the manufacturing process
