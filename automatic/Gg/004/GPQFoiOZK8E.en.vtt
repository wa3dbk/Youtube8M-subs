of people online have suggested is to

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
of people online have suggested is to
open<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> ps2<00:00:22.949> tray<00:00:23.510> just<00:00:24.510> before<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> glitch

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.529 
open the ps2 tray just before the glitch
occurs<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.859> bypass<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:29.539> cannot

occurs so you can bypass it I cannot
effectively<00:00:31.109> do<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.590> since<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.489> use

effectively do that since I have to use

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.450 
effectively do that since I have to use
a<00:00:32.610> slider<00:00:33.090> key<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:34.410> force<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.800> ps2<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> play

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

this Aeon and the reason why I'm doing

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
this Aeon and the reason why I'm doing
this<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.250> forgot<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.880> the

this is because I forgot to get the

trials near the beginning of the game

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
trials near the beginning of the game
hence<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.369> cannot<00:01:29.820> obtain<00:01:30.060> unison<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.720> vana<00:01:30.930> and

hence I cannot obtain unison or vana and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
hence I cannot obtain unison or vana and
I<00:01:31.920> found<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.759> midway<00:01:33.180> through

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I found that about this midway through

I found that about this midway through
the<00:01:33.509> game<00:01:33.689> since<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.920> first

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the game since this is actually my first

the game since this is actually my first

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
time playing the international version

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.520 
time playing the international version
of<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.500> ff10

and<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.400> didn't<00:01:40.640> want<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.850> throw<00:01:41.060> my<00:01:41.210> Sade<00:01:41.540> file

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
and I didn't want to throw my Sade file

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.510 
and I didn't want to throw my Sade file
away<00:01:42.050> since<00:01:42.530> I've<00:01:42.650> gotten<00:01:42.890> pretty<00:01:43.160> far<00:01:43.220> into

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
away since I've gotten pretty far into

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520 
away since I've gotten pretty far into
the<00:01:43.700> game<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.480> figured<00:01:44.870> I'd<00:01:44.990> try<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.290> push

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the game so I figured I'd try and push

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.170 
the game so I figured I'd try and push
through<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.950> glitch<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.550> hope<00:01:46.970> for<00:01:47.120> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
through this glitch and hope for the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180 
through this glitch and hope for the
best<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:48.140> I'm<00:01:48.229> sure<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.410> lot<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.010> are<00:01:49.070> in

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
best and I'm sure a lot of you are in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.690 
best and I'm sure a lot of you are in
this<00:01:49.310> pitfall<00:01:49.490> as<00:01:49.760> well<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:52.340> would<00:01:52.490> suggest

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
this pitfall as well and I would suggest

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.000 
this pitfall as well and I would suggest
avoid<00:01:53.210> use<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.720> Yojimbo<00:01:54.140> tactic<00:01:54.590> it's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
avoid use of the Yojimbo tactic it's

also<00:02:34.489> another<00:02:34.760> annoying<00:02:35.180> aspect<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:35.810> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
also another annoying aspect of this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.560 
also another annoying aspect of this
glitch<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.739> occur<00:02:37.070> after

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
glitch is that it can occur after

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.750 
glitch is that it can occur after
exiting<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.630> winning<00:02:38.989> prop<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.400> one

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
exiting the winning prop so this is one

00:02:40.760 --> 00:03:08.610 
exiting the winning prop so this is one
hell<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.180> hurdle<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.510> get<00:02:41.660> through
