filler<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.560> I'm<00:00:05.460> starting<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> notice<00:00:05.850> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
filler on and I'm starting to notice the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.849 
filler on and I'm starting to notice the
two<00:00:06.390> differences<00:00:06.899> between<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.350> two<00:00:07.470> panels

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
two differences between the two panels

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:08.960 
two differences between the two panels
where<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.040> screwed<00:00:08.250> up<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.550> one<00:00:08.700> actually

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
where I screwed up this one actually

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.129 
where I screwed up this one actually
looks<00:00:09.090> not<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.690> bad

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
looks not that bad

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
looks not that bad
the<00:00:10.950> driver's<00:00:11.670> side<00:00:11.820> they're<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> said

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the driver's side they're the one I said

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.200 
the driver's side they're the one I said
I<00:00:12.570> screwed<00:00:12.870> up<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I screwed up on as you can see what the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.349 
I screwed up on as you can see what the
filler<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.890> looks<00:00:16.890> pretty<00:00:17.160> good<00:00:17.340> especially<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
filler on looks pretty good especially I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.670 
filler on looks pretty good especially I
like<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.690> section<00:00:18.930> over<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.119> see

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
like this section over here you can see

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.849 
like this section over here you can see
just<00:00:22.680> flows<00:00:22.980> nicely<00:00:25.970> coming<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.090> over<00:00:27.269> here

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
just flows nicely coming to over here

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
just flows nicely coming to over here
this<00:00:28.859> parts<00:00:29.220> nice<00:00:29.429> kind<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.480> hard<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.470> from

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this parts nice kind of hard to see from

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.510 
this parts nice kind of hard to see from
this<00:00:31.949> angle<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.309> kind<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
this angle actually but you can kind of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.080 
this angle actually but you can kind of
see<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.820> flows<00:00:36.059> nicely<00:00:40.520> on<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> other

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
see how it flows nicely on to the other

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
see how it flows nicely on to the other
side<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> slide<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.469> worked

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
side now this is the slide that worked

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500 
side now this is the slide that worked
out<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> best<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.850> took<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
out the best because I took my time and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
out the best because I took my time and
all<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> planned<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:47.000> but<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> one

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
all that planned it out but it's the one

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
all that planned it out but it's the one
that's<00:00:48.360> give<00:00:48.539> me<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> most<00:00:48.870> problem<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that's give me the most problem at this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.900 
that's give me the most problem at this
stage<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> match<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
stage because I have to match it up to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.080 
stage because I have to match it up to
that<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.989> turns<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> one

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that one and it turns out that this one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.880 
that one and it turns out that this one
here<00:00:54.620> sits<00:00:55.620> lower<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:57.090> into<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> thing

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
here sits lower like more into the thing

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
here sits lower like more into the thing
against<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.309> door<00:00:59.520> actually<00:00:59.699> type<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
against the door actually type thing so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
against the door actually type thing so
you<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.699> how

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you look kind of you can kind of see how

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
you look kind of you can kind of see how
this<00:01:03.030> part<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.600> almost<00:01:03.899> flat<00:01:04.170> with

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this part is actually almost flat with

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.109 
this part is actually almost flat with
that<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:05.540> then<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> one's<00:01:06.900> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:08.119> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that and then this one's kind of off so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
that and then this one's kind of off so
I<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> build<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> mold

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
I have to kind of build it up and mold

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.609 
I have to kind of build it up and mold
it<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> fill<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> somehow<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.320> kind
