00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
 but you attacked 

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.100
 two pasta recipes 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.440
 so finished the muscle car 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.820
 I'm transcribing extreme but created in the senate house 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.879
 in other documentary scenes of the march making the palms 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.730
 everybody loves 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 I think a lot of people do not know 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.310
 elstor cidinha next door 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.529
 so the friendly work voice 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.679
 almost half of the use of the recipes have 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.649
 few animals 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.770
 the national title 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.280
 this is a goal to get back to the palm trees 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 this is the cookie it was given with the south 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 so it's focus on my pasta scene with water 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.030
 the rapporteur of the mark 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 and I will see with the Russian superstar 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.590
 who donate away waiting for cinnamon composite supervision is well 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.000
 delicious too 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 I'm going to spread water and sunshine. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 across the array 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 it's not that we're going to teach you how to do the mars double 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.670
 so I imagine that I will taste my massage 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.310
 breeze titles told cm 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 if on one side 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.880
 as if making a roll 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 here I'm going to spend a little more water 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.280
 what will you tyson 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.580
 Let's do next to both eyes. 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.680
 between the parts 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 it was a very sharp slice 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 I must cut off hunger 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.960
 and I'll put 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.700
 the palm trees 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 what will happen when he makes this flaky dough 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.809
 of those valtinho 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.809
 If the palms are bad 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.959
 the preheated oven hundred 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.519
 thirty degrees 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.409
 only here in the middle of the session in Tokyo I'm going to do I'm going to turn 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.789
 an insole 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.649
 it will paralyze on one side 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.889
 My son, he deserves it. 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.029
 so it will take an average of 20 pilots 10,000 square 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.129
 after the company 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.059
 win there 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.359
 I like pasta 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.719
 What can be the grated cheese week 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 already without space that goes cooking 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.609
 in sound 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.179
 because I'm going to like it 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.079
 the size of your preference 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.009
 can be a flagrant 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.009
 avoiding greater 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.359
 fortune 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.149
 seven rounds without a beat you can stand the baby alone 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 and you can pointed one over the other phone call 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.939
 also the whole society 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.779
 are two layers with a theme and if I want to do a beautiful 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.859
 I think the whole length of the apple 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:50.429
 in opposite situation the gymnast who a little bigger 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.639
 and I'll curl up with it highlights 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.489
 roll in the basilica of the little girl tighten 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.719
 when preheated to 180 degrees 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.989
 while growing if you go 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.399
 well I'll be back 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:18.549
 is the product for the refrigerator to be born very cold so she could have been the best 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.430
 fine and at 20 minutes 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.719
 here we are to me 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:31.439
 after roasting 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.259
 and the three beautiful children 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.379
 this little present
