00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi how about friends in my previous video 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.950
 I taught them how to make the bases for focus 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.010
 this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.440
 make a mold for thermo shape sometimes 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.420
 it is complicated to put the fomi 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.789
 hot on the unicel ball because 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 it moves us and it is wasted too much 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.449
 and that's why this time I'm going 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.699
 to teach how to make these little molds 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 home very well the first thing that you have to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.109
 take into account is the measure of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.019
 ball or the ball of unicel that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.980
 we want thermo shape this time it's going 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.129
 to be this that is 5 centimeters 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.090
 diameter then the first thing we have 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.840
 what to do is measure or with our 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.860
 compass dial two and a half centimeters 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.140
 because when we turn completely, 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.960
 give the five centimeters that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.809
 we need we are going to leave you about 34 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.690
 millimeters more so that the comic can 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.850
 enter and do not be the atoles then in 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.380
 a piece of paper shell we're going to 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 measure it and we're going to mark our circle 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.070
 a little more than 5 centimeters of 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 diameter we are going to mark 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.050
 and let's cut for that we can 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.960
 help him make scissors or a 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:40.510
 cutter in this case I'm going to do it with a 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:43.970
 tube and we will stay this way 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.100
 how we need to give firmness to our 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.530
 mold if we use it doing that 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.690
 grouping that we are going to double 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.150
 two equal pieces once we have 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.900
 and the two matching pieces that match 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.450
 our two little circles of 5 centimeters 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.000
 in diameter let's proceed to give them the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.580
 firmness that requires that is very simple 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.979
 what are we going to do with pallet sticks 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.940
 let's take some glue 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.400
 to stick the sticks what is all 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.470
 around our 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 for saying once they are 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.489
 logically they will be counted to the extent 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.989
 true so that the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.579
 tips once they are 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.310
 perfectly stuck then let's move 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.829
 to mark we will have something like this 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.189
 this piece is rigid enough 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.530
 to be able to transform without any and 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.170
 no complication this time I 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.790
 here I put 5 centimeters in diameter 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.680
 so that they do not confuse me because 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.709
 because we are going to do all the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.060
 we need this is 6 centimeters of 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.980
 7 centimeters of 8 centimeters and as already 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.319
 we're supposed to be dedicating ourselves to 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.810
 do with many because we need all 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.659
 these measures we can also even 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.150
 to make thermo shoes 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.829
 Tevez or lean will come explaining 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.810
 how is our tutor done? 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.060
 way to use our mold is very 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.470
 simple let's help us with these 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.590
 strollers that get in any 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.810
 stationery we are going to cut our foami 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.650
 to the size of our mold and we're going to 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.430
 hold with 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.739
 will be perfectly pressed on 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.690
 foam and so that in this way there is no 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.350
 no problem and get hot 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.260
 without any problem 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.360
 and we can very well use 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.160
 anything to help yourself thermo shape 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.950
 this time I'm going to use my 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.330
 migraine pills and I'm going to put 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.850
 my little ball on top of let's warm up 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.010
 perfectly the foam and 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.700
 let's help us on the plate well 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.090
 hot for what 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.790
 this is perfectly hot they have to 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.500
 ask what is this is a sheet to me 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.170
 I do not like to put the foam and directly 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.230
 grilled because it tends to change 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.720
 color then sometimes it grabs a few tones 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.239
 not very suitable me that's why I do not use 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.920
 a piece of paper that helps me like 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.140
 insulator so that I do not burn 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.639
 directly the fomÃ­n you are going to 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.440
 give an account of the fomin what 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.590
 hot enough because it 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.949
 they feel very 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.940
 very soft and once that then no longer 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:30.199
 we have perfectly hot we are going to 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.199
 start to see what form 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.720
 it's very simple here we are going to give you the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.290
 depth that one requires we are going to 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:44.060
 hold there for a few seconds until 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.920
 let's see what is cold and ready 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.650
 perfectly well we have 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.640
 formed our policy is we proceed to 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.220
 remove the bits and then we 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.690
 you are left this way with this you 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.490
 you can realize that you do not know 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.830
 He missed me and left us 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.530
 perfectly where are we going to do the 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.860
 court to proceed to make either the 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.780
 little pussy hair little face 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.570
 wasted bowler and in a way 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.190
 very simple guys this was the tutorial 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.340
 of today's video I hope you liked it 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.010
 and I hope it's practical for them to continue 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.780
 creating its beautiful many we see ourselves in 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.140
 the next tutorial they have very 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.140
 all right
