00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.070
 we have to present what they are 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 new pop ups and fluorescent and much thing 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 important a new boilers and that the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:24.109
 dynamo has placed on the balanced market 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:27.920
 or is 50 percent composed of 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.880
 product pop up and therefore that tends 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.980
 obviously to make the boyle and if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.829
 float by 50 percent that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.620
 instead it is basically a bait 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 founding the mother if she does not get fishing 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 perfectly balanced than in this one 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
 occasion gave great results like 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 has given great results there 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.079
 continuing to give the double trigger 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 snow domino and therefore the new ranks 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.039
 new pop up bags gave great 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.850
 results 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.940
 the pop-up waste has been for years now 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.519
 are giving great results and here in 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.360
 particular we have a lot of colors 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.549
 turned on very very very obvious that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:18.750
 often make the capturing trigger 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.540
 of carp have a peculiarity not 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 distinguish the various shades as we are 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.850
 accustomed us thought 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.330
 hence the various various shades with respect to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 to the jaws of color but they are a lot 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.790
 very attracted by the differences of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 shade therefore from light to dark 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.060
 dark and colorful it was mobile in all 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 those cases and this one definitely has one of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.110
 those where the bottom has many 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 obstacles and mostly very rich in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.880
 haga a very obvious trigger a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.409
 trigger that it discovers from afar is 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.409
 definitely more captured 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.180
 this is the fruit of a reed that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.269
 has been launched 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.800
 so it's the demonstration that sometimes 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:14.299
 even in difficult situations like 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.890
 these, even if well prepared, the mails to 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.370
 snare can be good 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.370
 fruits
