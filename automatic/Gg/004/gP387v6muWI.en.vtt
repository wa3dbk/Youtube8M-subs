00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
and see how that works

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.599 
and see how that works
this<00:00:04.259> looks<00:00:04.529> like<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.799> slides<00:00:05.040> out<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.370> side

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
this looks like it slides out the side

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.600 
this looks like it slides out the side

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.810 
setting in a display case okay we got
that<00:00:13.110> out<00:00:13.849> and<00:00:14.849> then<00:00:15.000> keyboard<00:00:16.070> right<00:00:17.070> here

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820

all right
I<00:00:21.960> looked<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.380> both<00:00:22.470> keyboards<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
I looked at both keyboards this one I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
I looked at both keyboards this one I
was<00:00:24.630> actually<00:00:24.900> amazed<00:00:25.500> by<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> fact<00:00:25.920> that

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
was actually amazed by the fact that

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
was actually amazed by the fact that
when<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> sat<00:00:26.699> down<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.939> front<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.660> could

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
when I sat down in front of it I could

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
when I sat down in front of it I could
type<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.099> full<00:00:29.340> speed<00:00:29.670> which<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
type it just about full speed which is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
type it just about full speed which is
for<00:00:30.480> me<00:00:30.570> he's<00:00:30.720> probably<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.080> 45<00:00:31.710> 50<00:00:31.949> words<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
for me he's probably about 45 50 words a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.120 
for me he's probably about 45 50 words a
minute<00:00:33.230> didn't<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.380> didn't<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> great<00:00:35.010> deal

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
minute didn't I didn't have a great deal

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.040 
minute didn't I didn't have a great deal
but<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.430> didn't<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.790> any<00:00:36.030> mistakes<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.930> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
but I didn't make any mistakes and it is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.160 
but I didn't make any mistakes and it is
thin<00:00:37.670> supposedly<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.790> adds<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> half<00:00:39.300> pounds<00:00:39.930> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
thin supposedly it adds a half pounds to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.310 
thin supposedly it adds a half pounds to
the<00:00:40.290> weight<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.250> surface<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the weight of the surface and then the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
the weight of the surface and then the
part<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> keys<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.520> actually

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
part with the keys is what actually

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
part with the keys is what actually
folds<00:00:45.210> onto<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.510> glass<00:00:45.719> which<00:00:45.989> had<00:00:46.200> me<00:00:46.469> kind

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
folds onto the glass which had me kind

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
folds onto the glass which had me kind
of<00:00:47.129> concerned<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.030> told<00:00:48.360> me<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:48.660> be

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of concerned but they told me don't be

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.119 
of concerned but they told me don't be
concerned<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.379> taking<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.980> into

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
concerned that taking that into

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.209 
concerned that taking that into
consideration<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.079> top

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
consideration so here at the very top

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
consideration so here at the very top
we've<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.730> metal<00:00:54.000> pins<00:00:54.559> which<00:00:55.559> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we've got the little metal pins which in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.540 
we've got the little metal pins which in
this<00:00:55.860> case<00:00:56.160> will<00:00:56.820> match<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
this case will match up with but you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.189 
this case will match up with but you
basically<00:00:59.699> line<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.329> set<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
basically line it up set it there and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.759 
basically line it up set it there and
the<00:01:01.260> keyboard<00:01:01.680> should<00:01:02.270> do<00:01:03.270> its<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.769> I've

other<00:02:22.130> than<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.400> pretty<00:02:22.580> good<00:02:22.819> that's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
other than that pretty good that's

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.740 
other than that pretty good that's
pretty<00:02:23.750> much<00:02:23.900> my<00:02:24.110> typing<00:02:24.440> speed<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.750> not

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
pretty much my typing speed and not

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.800 
pretty much my typing speed and not
quite<00:02:26.930> as<00:02:27.080> comfortable<00:02:27.290> as<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.770> there's<00:02:28.010> more

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
quite as comfortable as if there's more

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.750 
quite as comfortable as if there's more
traveling<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.930> keys<00:02:30.140> but<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:30.890> enough<00:02:31.250> to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
traveling the keys but it's enough to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.330 
traveling the keys but it's enough to
let<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.450> touch<00:02:32.480> type<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:33.260> good<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.770> I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
let you touch type so it's good and I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.979 
let you touch type so it's good and I
did<00:02:34.550> wonder<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.390> didn't<00:02:35.600> try<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.750> out

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
did wonder because I didn't try this out

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.570 
did wonder because I didn't try this out
with<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.200> Microsoft<00:02:36.590> Store<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.130> thought<00:02:37.459> it

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
with the Microsoft Store I thought it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.040 
with the Microsoft Store I thought it
was<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> Bluetooth<00:02:38.120> keyboard<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.750> wondered

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
was a Bluetooth keyboard and I wondered

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.870 
was a Bluetooth keyboard and I wondered
if<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.290> pulled<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> off<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:40.520> still<00:02:40.730> be

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
if I pulled it off if I would still be

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.390 
if I pulled it off if I would still be
able<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.150> type<00:02:41.770> but<00:02:42.770> then<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:42.980> realize<00:02:43.370> it's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
able to type but then I realize it's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100 
able to type but then I realize it's
probably<00:02:43.940> no<00:02:44.000> battery<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.600> without<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
probably no battery in it without the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.490 
probably no battery in it without the
power<00:02:45.290> yeah<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:47.180> no<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.050> does<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.470> be

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
power yeah so no it does have to be

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.930 
power yeah so no it does have to be
hooked<00:02:48.739> up<00:02:48.920> you've<00:02:49.160> got<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.400> get<00:02:49.459> those<00:02:49.610> pins

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
hooked up you've got to get those pins

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.630 
hooked up you've got to get those pins

though<00:03:41.900> those<00:03:42.829> things<00:03:43.070> do<00:03:43.250> work<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.790> like

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
though those things do work so I like

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.539 
though those things do work so I like
this<00:03:50.329> keyboard<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:51.019> don't<00:03:51.350> know<00:03:51.410> if<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.560> like<00:03:51.680> 129

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
this keyboard I don't know if I like 129

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.370 
this keyboard I don't know if I like 129
dollars<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.239> bit<00:03:53.420> much<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.079> think<00:03:54.109> of

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
dollars it's a bit much if you think of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.140 
dollars it's a bit much if you think of
it<00:03:54.470> just<00:03:54.620> as<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.859> keyboard<00:03:55.130> but<00:03:55.579> with<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.940> cover

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
it just as a keyboard but with the cover

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.400 
it just as a keyboard but with the cover
and<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.510> fact<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.109> so<00:03:57.230> expensive

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
and the fact that this is so expensive

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.840 
and the fact that this is so expensive
anyway<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:57.950> suppose<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.519> kind<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.700> all<00:03:58.820> goes

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
anyway I suppose it kind of all goes

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.360 
anyway I suppose it kind of all goes
together<00:03:59.530> what<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.769> say<00:04:00.920> though<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.220> in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
together what I can say though is in

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.160 
together what I can say though is in
comparison<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.209> other<00:04:02.359> keyboard<00:04:02.870> which<00:04:03.019> I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
comparison to the other keyboard which I

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.069 
comparison to the other keyboard which I
tried<00:04:03.440> out<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.010> cover<00:04:04.970> keyboard<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.750> just

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
tried out the cover keyboard that just

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.289 
tried out the cover keyboard that just
has<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.220> letters<00:04:07.489> printed<00:04:07.940> on<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.209> you

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
has the the letters printed on it you

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.210 
has the the letters printed on it you
just<00:04:08.510> tap<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.019> didn't<00:04:09.560> care<00:04:09.739> for<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:09.980> at

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
just tap on I didn't care for that at

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.500 
just tap on I didn't care for that at
all<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.850> think<00:04:10.910> that<00:04:11.150> price<00:04:11.359> difference

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
all it's I think that price difference

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.440 
all it's I think that price difference
is<00:04:11.780> only<00:04:11.959> ten<00:04:12.230> dollars<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:12.859> I<00:04:13.040> really<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.239> if

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
is only ten dollars so I really think if

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.060 
is only ten dollars so I really think if
you're<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.630> touch<00:04:14.810> typist<00:04:15.049> this<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.680> worth<00:04:15.859> it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
you're a touch typist this is worth it

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.800 
you're a touch typist this is worth it
to<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.340> spend<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.120> little<00:04:17.209> bit<00:04:17.419> more<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.720> to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
to you to spend a little bit more and to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.570 
to you to spend a little bit more and to
get<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.079> one<00:04:18.350> if<00:04:18.680> you're<00:04:18.950> just<00:04:19.099> a<00:04:19.250> hunt<00:04:19.430> and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
get this one if you're just a hunt and

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.099 
get this one if you're just a hunt and
peck<00:04:19.729> anyway<00:04:20.090> maybe<00:04:20.330> you<00:04:20.510> don't<00:04:20.690> care<00:04:20.900> if<00:04:21.019> you

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
peck anyway maybe you don't care if you

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.480 
peck anyway maybe you don't care if you
tap<00:04:21.289> it<00:04:21.440> on<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.590> screen<00:04:21.919> or<00:04:22.130> tapping

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
tap it on the screen or tapping

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.909 
tap it on the screen or tapping
mechanical<00:04:23.120> keyboard<00:04:23.569> and<00:04:23.870> I've<00:04:24.500> heard<00:04:24.680> that

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
mechanical keyboard and I've heard that

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.460 
mechanical keyboard and I've heard that
if<00:04:25.099> you<00:04:25.250> close<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.880> cover<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.539> it<00:04:26.780> puts<00:04:27.319> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
if you close the cover that it puts the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.249 
if you close the cover that it puts the
screen<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:28.789> sleep<00:04:29.419> basically<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:29.990> think<00:04:30.110> the

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
screen to sleep basically I think the

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.420 
screen to sleep basically I think the
computer<00:04:30.530> supposed<00:04:30.889> to<00:04:30.979> still<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.310> running

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
computer supposed to still be running

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.339 
computer supposed to still be running
but<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.849> screen<00:04:32.090> goes<00:04:32.300> dark<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:33.110> kind<00:04:33.289> of

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
but the screen goes dark it's kind of

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.689 
but the screen goes dark it's kind of
hard<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.590> tell<00:04:33.800> if<00:04:33.979> it's<00:04:34.130> happening<00:04:34.520> because

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
hard to tell if it's happening because

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.689 
hard to tell if it's happening because
you<00:04:34.910> got<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.120> get<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> screen<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:35.900> close<00:04:36.199> in

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
you got to get the screen so close in

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.700 
you got to get the screen so close in
but<00:04:37.699> I<00:04:37.940> can<00:04:38.090> kind<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.419> see<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:38.750> blue<00:04:39.050> light<00:04:39.470> in

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
but I can kind of see the blue light in

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.040 
but I can kind of see the blue light in
there<00:04:40.009> and<00:04:40.310> then<00:04:40.970> now<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:41.300> out<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.780> would

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
there and then now it's out so I would

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.409 
there and then now it's out so I would
say<00:04:42.229> within<00:04:42.440> about<00:04:42.590> two<00:04:42.860> seconds<00:04:43.280> your<00:04:44.000> screen

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
say within about two seconds your screen

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.999 
say within about two seconds your screen
goes<00:04:44.599> dark<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.050> assume<00:04:45.289> it's<00:04:45.440> still<00:04:45.620> running<00:04:45.770> in

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
goes dark I assume it's still running in

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.480 
goes dark I assume it's still running in
sleep<00:04:46.280> mode<00:04:46.520> when<00:04:46.849> we<00:04:47.539> open<00:04:47.840> up<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:47.960> cover<00:04:48.490> it

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.770 
sleep mode when we open up the cover it
doesn't<00:04:49.849> wake<00:04:50.060> back<00:04:50.240> up<00:04:50.509> so<00:04:51.759> it<00:04:52.759> key<00:04:53.180> there<00:04:53.690> we

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780

the keyboard when you're using it as a
cover

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
cover

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.939

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620

felt but I don't know it's the nearest

felt but I don't know it's the nearest
thing<00:05:08.389> I<00:05:08.509> can<00:05:08.720> think<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.460> material<00:05:10.460> it's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
thing I can think of this material it's

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.330 
thing I can think of this material it's
a<00:05:10.729> little<00:05:10.940> soft<00:05:11.270> yet<00:05:11.840> strong<00:05:12.190> well<00:05:13.190> that's

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
a little soft yet strong well that's

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.980 
a little soft yet strong well that's
about<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.580> for<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.909> keyboard<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.479> mean<00:05:14.630> what

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
can you say about a keyboard I'll try it

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.300 
can you say about a keyboard I'll try it
with<00:05:16.759> gaming<00:05:17.150> when<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.360> get<00:05:17.630> some<00:05:18.620> first-person
