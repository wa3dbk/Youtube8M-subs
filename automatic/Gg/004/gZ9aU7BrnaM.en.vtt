that a little bit because you come into
this<00:03:12.150> knowing<00:03:12.299> you've<00:03:12.480> got<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.720> face<00:03:12.840> not<00:03:13.440> one

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
this knowing you've got to face not one

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.140 
this knowing you've got to face not one
but<00:03:13.739> two<00:03:13.950> opponents<00:03:14.220> right<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.670> best<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.090> three

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
but two opponents right a best of three

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.509 
but two opponents right a best of three
and<00:03:15.480> then<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.930> best<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.290> five<00:03:16.350> how<00:03:17.190> much<00:03:17.310> did<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
and then a best of five how much did you

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.199 
and then a best of five how much did you
prepare<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:17.970> each<00:03:18.120> opponent<00:03:18.769> we<00:03:19.850> we<00:03:20.850> prepared

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
prepare for each opponent we we prepared

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.470 
prepare for each opponent we we prepared
more<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> salad<00:03:22.470> bar<00:03:22.620> pick<00:03:23.160> up<00:03:23.310> because<00:03:23.549> but

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
more for a salad bar pick up because but

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.650 
more for a salad bar pick up because but
like<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.459> guess<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.579> prepared<00:03:26.910> both<00:03:27.209> equally

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
like I guess we prepared both equally

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.420 
like I guess we prepared both equally
like<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> little<00:03:28.590> bit<00:03:28.709> more<00:03:28.829> for<00:03:28.980> salad<00:03:29.280> bar

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
like a little bit more for salad bar

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.160 
like a little bit more for salad bar
because<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.299> didn't<00:03:30.630> want<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:30.930> knocked

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
because we didn't want to get knocked

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.750 
because we didn't want to get knocked
out<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.500> then<00:03:31.620> mar<00:03:32.010> wouldn't<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.400> mattered

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
out and then mar wouldn't have mattered

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.420 
out and then mar wouldn't have mattered
so<00:03:33.530> all<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.890> final<00:03:35.010> question<00:03:35.340> for

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
we have to keep in mind velocity was

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.129 
we have to keep in mind velocity was
already<00:04:28.819> down<00:04:29.030> actually<00:04:29.780> were<00:04:29.840> just<00:04:29.960> going<00:04:30.080> to

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
already down actually were just going to

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.510

where we actually have the tower dive

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.459 
where we actually have the tower dive
over<00:04:34.550> lhasa<00:04:34.729> t<00:04:34.939> came<00:04:35.120> in<00:04:35.300> we'll<00:04:36.259> get<00:04:36.349> this

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
over lhasa t came in we'll get this

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:37.839 
over lhasa t came in we'll get this
right<00:04:36.680> eventually<00:04:36.919> here's<00:04:37.310> velocity<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:37.789> is

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
right eventually here's velocity this is

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.459 
right eventually here's velocity this is
the<00:04:37.939> second<00:04:38.240> game<00:04:38.360> big<00:04:39.020> thing<00:04:39.169> we<00:04:39.259> got<00:04:39.379> to

watch<00:04:39.590> here<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:39.860> velocities<00:04:40.219> essentially

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
watch here is velocities essentially

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.240 
watch here is velocities essentially
daring<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.300> salad<00:04:41.659> bar<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.319> jump<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.919> and

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
initiate them because chris has actually

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.809 
initiate them because chris has actually
tanked<00:04:45.500> about<00:04:45.650> six<00:04:46.009> Church<00:04:46.250> shots<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:46.699> a<00:04:46.789> row

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
and velocity just going to walk in and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.719 
and velocity just going to walk in and
take<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.889> so<00:04:49.039> if<00:04:49.129> we<00:04:49.219> actually<00:04:49.460> just<00:04:49.490> roll

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
take this so if we actually just roll

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.399 
take this so if we actually just roll
the<00:04:49.849> clip<00:04:50.060> we'll<00:04:50.419> see<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.629> salad<00:04:50.930> bar<00:04:51.050> who<00:04:51.229> has

was<00:05:47.539> actually<00:05:47.870> taken<00:05:48.289> away<00:05:48.560> by<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:50.690> salad<00:05:51.080> bar

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
was actually taken away by the salad bar

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.469 
was actually taken away by the salad bar
because<00:05:52.159> velocity<00:05:52.339> was<00:05:52.819> so<00:05:52.969> effective<00:05:53.360> within

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
because velocity was so effective within

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.600 
because velocity was so effective within
this<00:05:53.659> time<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.349> velocity<00:05:54.919> didn't<00:05:55.310> let<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.430> get

this time but velocity didn't let it get
to<00:05:55.759> late<00:05:55.789> game<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.389> here's<00:05:56.960> generally<00:05:57.379> why<00:05:57.500> as

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
to late game and here's generally why as

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.409 
to late game and here's generally why as
we<00:05:58.159> see<00:05:58.339> if<00:05:58.430> we<00:05:58.550> roll<00:05:58.729> this<00:05:58.849> clip<00:05:59.089> they<00:05:59.240> just

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
we see if we roll this clip they just

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:00.879 
we see if we roll this clip they just
dive<00:05:59.659> in<00:05:59.839> the<00:05:59.930> tower<00:06:00.139> as<00:06:00.379> fast<00:06:00.650> as<00:06:00.860> possible

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
dive in the tower as fast as possible

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.730 
dive in the tower as fast as possible
while<00:06:01.699> twitches<00:06:02.120> off<00:06:02.270> farming<00:06:02.719> they<00:06:03.110> take<00:06:03.560> it

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
while twitches off farming they take it

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.019 
while twitches off farming they take it
to<00:06:03.889> them<00:06:04.009> they<00:06:04.099> get<00:06:04.190> some<00:06:04.370> pills<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:04.610> pause<00:06:04.819> it

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
to them they get some pills and pause it

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.839 
to them they get some pills and pause it
right<00:06:05.509> about<00:06:05.750> here<00:06:06.159> lost<00:06:07.159> some<00:06:07.339> stuff<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.729> can

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
right about here lost some stuff you can

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.450 
right about here lost some stuff you can
see<00:06:08.000> velocity<00:06:08.440> seems<00:06:09.440> like<00:06:09.650> a<00:06:09.680> lost<00:06:09.949> dive<00:06:10.219> as

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
see velocity seems like a lost dive as
