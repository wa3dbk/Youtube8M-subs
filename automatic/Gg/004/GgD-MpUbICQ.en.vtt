tutorial<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.180> actually<00:01:34.450> very<00:01:34.480> easy<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.230> do<00:01:35.410> but

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
tutorial is actually very easy to do but

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.850 
tutorial is actually very easy to do but
very<00:01:36.070> very<00:01:36.310> useful<00:01:37.350> since<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.500> Gears<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.800> War

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
very very useful since the Gears of War

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340 
very very useful since the Gears of War
series<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> third-person<00:01:39.910> game<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:41.140> right

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
series is a third-person game the right

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.070 
series is a third-person game the right
side<00:01:41.620> always<00:01:42.070> has<00:01:42.250> an<00:01:42.400> advantage<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.810> the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
side always has an advantage because the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.620 
side always has an advantage because the
Gunners<00:01:44.320> position<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.950> right<00:01:45.100> side

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
Gunners position on the right side

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.700 
Gunners position on the right side
you'll<00:01:46.630> always<00:01:46.960> have<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.140> better<00:01:47.350> line<00:01:47.560> of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
you'll always have a better line of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.950 
you'll always have a better line of
sight<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:49.120> if<00:01:49.270> you're<00:01:49.420> coming<00:01:49.570> up<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:49.870> an

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
sight so if you're coming up on an

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.900 
sight so if you're coming up on an
opponent<00:01:50.530> who<00:01:50.680> has<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> right<00:01:51.220> hand<00:01:51.430> advantage

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
opponent who has a right hand advantage

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.020 
opponent who has a right hand advantage
