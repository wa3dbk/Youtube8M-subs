00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
then to make it as easy as possible I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660

decided<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.800> plug<00:00:35.070> thingy<00:00:35.340> which

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
decided to get this plug thingy which

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.150 
decided to get this plug thingy which
you<00:00:35.879> just<00:00:36.149> attach<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.539> a<00:00:36.780> battery<00:00:37.079> both<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you just attach to a battery both the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
you just attach to a battery both the
plug<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.820> bulbs<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.270> pretty

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
plug and the bulbs are pretty

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.180 
plug and the bulbs are pretty
inexpensive

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.319 

first<00:00:50.190> make<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.429> sketch<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.909> basic<00:00:51.179> design

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
first make a sketch for the basic design

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
first make a sketch for the basic design
then<00:00:51.809> take<00:00:52.019> some<00:00:52.170> wire<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.679> use<00:00:52.949> pliers<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
then take some wire and use pliers to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.569 
then take some wire and use pliers to
bend<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.589> for<00:00:55.589> something<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
bend it for something like this

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
bend it for something like this
I'd<00:00:56.640> prefer<00:00:57.030> using<00:00:57.390> copper<00:00:57.750> wire<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:58.289> sawed

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
I'd prefer using copper wire and sawed

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.439 
I'd prefer using copper wire and sawed
out<00:00:58.739> together<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.429> get<00:00:59.549> a<00:00:59.609> much<00:00:59.820> more<00:01:00.059> durable

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
out together to get a much more durable

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
out together to get a much more durable
end<00:01:00.780> result<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.979> wanted<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> show<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
end result but I wanted to show you that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
end result but I wanted to show you that
you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.390> still<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.110> even<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.559> don't

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you can still make one even if you don't

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.279 
you can still make one even if you don't
have<00:01:04.920> soldering<00:01:05.309> supplies<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.140> I'm

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
have soldering supplies so the way I'm

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.080 
have soldering supplies so the way I'm
using<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.860> you'll<00:01:08.130> remake<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.610> wire<00:01:08.820> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
using is just you'll remake your wire in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.529 
using is just you'll remake your wire in
point<00:01:09.570> eight<00:01:09.810> millimeters<00:01:11.210> you'll<00:01:12.210> need<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
point eight millimeters you'll need to

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.840 
point eight millimeters you'll need to
make<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.930> each<00:01:13.229> piece<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> first<00:01:14.640> two

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
make for each piece for the first two

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.370 
make for each piece for the first two
pieces<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.750> glued<00:01:16.049> them<00:01:16.200> together

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
pieces I then just glued them together

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.010 
pieces I then just glued them together
and<00:01:16.830> once<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:17.580> glue<00:01:17.700> has<00:01:17.789> dried<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.420> wrap<00:01:18.780> some

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and once the glue has dried I wrap some

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
and once the glue has dried I wrap some
point<00:01:19.289> two<00:01:19.500> five<00:01:19.770> millimeter<00:01:20.310> wire<00:01:20.580> around<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
point two five millimeter wire around it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
point two five millimeter wire around it
for<00:01:21.659> extra<00:01:21.990> support<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:23.789> don't<00:01:23.970> necessarily

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
for extra support you don't necessarily

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080 
for extra support you don't necessarily
have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> wrap<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> extra<00:01:26.069> wire<00:01:26.310> round<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> but

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
have to wrap the extra wire round it but

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.469 
have to wrap the extra wire round it but
just<00:01:27.240> make<00:01:27.509> sure<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:28.049> very<00:01:28.380> strong<00:01:28.530> glue

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
based glue for this such as C 6000 but

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.150 
based glue for this such as C 6000 but
remember<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.500> stay<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.920> well-ventilated

drop<00:03:35.160> shape<00:03:35.400> kind<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.850> beats<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.209> had<00:03:36.450> with

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
drop shape kind of beats I had with

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.290 
drop shape kind of beats I had with
these<00:03:36.900> sapphires<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.709> there<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.610> no<00:03:38.790> way<00:03:39.000> I'd

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
these sapphires and there is no way I'd

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.180 
these sapphires and there is no way I'd
permanently<00:03:40.020> attach<00:03:40.319> sapphires<00:03:40.800> on<00:03:41.069> to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
permanently attach sapphires on to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.650 
permanently attach sapphires on to
something<00:03:41.580> that's<00:03:41.760> held<00:03:42.030> together<00:03:42.150> by<00:03:42.480> glue

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
something that's held together by glue

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.570 
something that's held together by glue
and<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.380> made<00:03:43.620> using<00:03:43.980> glass<00:03:44.220> or<00:03:44.430> plastic

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
and this made using glass or plastic

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.059 
and this made using glass or plastic
beads<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:45.870> these<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.260> just<00:03:46.560> added<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.950> small

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
beads so for these I just added a small

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.070 
beads so for these I just added a small
piece<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.370> wire<00:03:47.700> almost<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.569> Christmas

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
piece of wire almost like a Christmas

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.960 
piece of wire almost like a Christmas
ornament<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.010> could<00:03:50.220> hang<00:03:50.400> them<00:03:50.580> onto<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
ornament so I could hang them onto the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.940 
ornament so I could hang them onto the
chandelier<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.690> take<00:03:52.140> them<00:03:52.319> off<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.530> reuse

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
chandelier and take them off and reuse

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.540 
chandelier and take them off and reuse
them<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:54.650> would<00:03:55.650> love<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.130> make<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.310> more

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
them I would love to make a more

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.280 
them I would love to make a more
detailed<00:03:56.970> version<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.540> chandelier<00:03:57.930> at<00:03:58.080> some

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
detailed version of a chandelier at some

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.320 
detailed version of a chandelier at some
point<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.770> then<00:03:59.250> soldered<00:03:59.730> instead<00:04:00.239> of

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
point and then soldered instead of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.720 
point and then soldered instead of
gluing<00:04:00.630> for<00:04:01.440> something<00:04:01.800> like<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.190> which<00:04:02.550> is

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
gluing for something like that which is

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.370 
gluing for something like that which is
going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.000> be<00:04:03.150> more<00:04:03.300> sturdy<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.810> wouldn't<00:04:04.230> mind

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
going to be more sturdy I wouldn't mind

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.250 
going to be more sturdy I wouldn't mind
