00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.390 
there's not a handle his hand just fits
into<00:03:06.549> this<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.950> um<00:03:10.620> most<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.010> designs

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
into this you um most of the designs

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.300 
into this you um most of the designs
like<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:14.049> is<00:03:14.230> really<00:03:14.409> small<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:15.010> very

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
like this is really small and it's very

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.740 
like this is really small and it's very
hard<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.609> paint<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.180> had<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.480> use<00:03:16.599> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
hard to paint so I had to use a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.470 
hard to paint so I had to use a
toothpick<00:03:16.989> for<00:03:17.469> it<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:18.579> came<00:03:18.760> out<00:03:18.790> very<00:03:19.150> good

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
toothpick for it it came out very good

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.250 
toothpick for it it came out very good
and<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.669> Flag<00:03:21.939> link<00:03:21.969> came<00:03:22.659> out<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.019> lot

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
and I think the Flag link came out a lot

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.550 
and I think the Flag link came out a lot
better<00:03:23.500> than<00:03:23.859> other<00:03:24.129> way<00:03:24.400> going<00:03:24.579> sexy<00:03:25.560> because

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
better than other way going sexy because

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.319 
better than other way going sexy because
