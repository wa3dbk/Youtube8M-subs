the overall strategy teams deck is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.380 
the overall strategy teams deck is
basically<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.290> start<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.830> by<00:01:07.909> adding<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
basically you start out by adding a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.539 
basically you start out by adding a
couple<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.140> lands<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:10.950> splitting<00:01:11.280> out

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
couple of lands and then splitting out

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.719 
couple of lands and then splitting out
really<00:01:12.420> big<00:01:12.720> creatures<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.890> when<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> came<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
really big creatures now when it came to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.179 
really big creatures now when it came to
defense<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.720> add<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.409> lands<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> then

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
defense you add some more lands and then

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.370 
defense you add some more lands and then
you<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.000> even<00:01:18.030> bigger<00:01:18.540> creature<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you put out even bigger creature you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
you put out even bigger creature you
know<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> monster<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> can

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

know like this monster also as you can
tell<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> recipe<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.280> didn't<00:01:23.549> really

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
tell from the recipe you didn't really

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.899 
tell from the recipe you didn't really
have<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.509> much<00:01:25.189> resources<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.610> way<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
have that much resources in the way of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
have that much resources in the way of
lands<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.500> look<00:01:28.650> at<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
lands because if you look at the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
lands because if you look at the
artifacts<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.610> pretty<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:30.000> had<00:01:30.299> like

the gathering they were a lot easier to

was<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.939> uncommon<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.930> once<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.380> had

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
was not very uncommon and once you had

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
was not very uncommon and once you had
enough<00:01:52.829> mana<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.850> only<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> matter<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.450> time

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
enough mana it was only a matter of time

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
enough mana it was only a matter of time
before<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.140> drop<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> demonic<00:01:56.009> hordes<00:01:56.250> will

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
before you drop the demonic hordes will

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.500 
before you drop the demonic hordes will
they<00:01:56.759> instill<00:01:57.329> energy

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
they instill energy

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.410 
they instill energy
and<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.350> beat<00:01:59.560> your<00:01:59.770> opponent<00:02:00.250> in<00:02:00.370> two<00:02:00.670> ways

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
and you beat your opponent in two ways

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.990 
and you beat your opponent in two ways
because<00:02:01.930> demonic<00:02:02.440> hordes<00:02:02.680> are<00:02:03.010> basically<00:02:03.370> 5:5

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
because demonic hordes are basically 5:5

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.330 
because demonic hordes are basically 5:5
then<00:02:04.780> demonic<00:02:05.260> hordes<00:02:05.470> have<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.920> ability<00:02:06.310> to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
then demonic hordes have the ability to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.820 
then demonic hordes have the ability to
destroy<00:02:06.760> one<00:02:07.030> lamb<00:02:07.270> by<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:07.990> simply<00:02:08.290> tapping

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.180 
had that instill energy on them you
could<00:02:12.970> at<00:02:13.180> least<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:14.110> rid<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.380> two<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:15.010> your

cards<00:02:39.610> all<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.970> much<00:02:40.300> because<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:41.650> saw

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
cards all that much because they saw

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.150 
cards all that much because they saw
white<00:02:42.250> cards<00:02:42.910> as<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:46.500> lot<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> players<00:02:48.010> out

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
white cards as a lot of players out

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.040 
white cards as a lot of players out
there<00:02:48.400> didn't<00:02:48.700> have<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.910> full<00:02:49.180> set<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.480> boxes

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.040 
there didn't have a full set of boxes
which<00:02:50.650> made<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.100> land<00:02:51.370> kill<00:02:51.700> strategy<00:02:52.360> with

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
which made the land kill strategy with

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.760 
which made the land kill strategy with
this<00:02:53.200> deck<00:02:53.500> even<00:02:53.920> more<00:02:54.459> in<00:02:55.240> my<00:02:56.020> humble<00:02:56.500> opinion

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
this deck even more in my humble opinion

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.940 
this deck even more in my humble opinion
I<00:02:57.490> believe<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.510> land<00:02:58.780> kill<00:02:59.230> strategy

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
I believe that the land kill strategy

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.210 
I believe that the land kill strategy
where<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.520> first<00:03:01.440> universally<00:03:02.440> accepted

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
where the first universally accepted

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.340 
where the first universally accepted
tournament<00:03:03.730> strategies<00:03:04.300> ever<00:03:04.600> created

tournament strategies ever created

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.070 
tournament strategies ever created
I<00:03:05.380> will<00:03:05.830> admit<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.459> not<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.970> very<00:03:07.390> refined

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
I will admit it's not a very refined

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.520 
I will admit it's not a very refined
deck<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:09.550> with<00:03:09.730> what<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.120> has<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.780> does<00:03:11.170> pretty

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
deck but with what it has it does pretty

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.150 
deck but with what it has it does pretty
damn<00:03:11.860> well<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.600> before<00:03:13.600> because<00:03:14.530> land<00:03:14.860> kill

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
damn well and before because land kill

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.820 
damn well and before because land kill
decks<00:03:15.610> actually<00:03:16.150> hit<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.480> ceiling<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.230> lot<00:03:17.680> of

who made this I would love to just tell

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.479 
who made this I would love to just tell
things<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.170> dude<00:03:38.410> do<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.680> realize<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.160> you

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.740 
are the fucking full runner for land
kill<00:03:41.739> which<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.550> another<00:03:42.820> reason<00:03:43.090> why<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.420> is

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
kill which is another reason why this is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.059 
kill which is another reason why this is
in<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.959> top<00:03:44.170> ten<00:03:44.500> most

index talking about the weaknesses of

index talking about the weaknesses of
this<00:03:48.670> deck<00:03:48.939> I<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.540> say<00:03:49.749> probably<00:03:50.249> the

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:51.249 
this deck I have to say probably the

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.030 
this deck I have to say probably the
weakness<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:52.030> Al<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.230> destruction<00:03:53.680> deck

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
weakness of Al and destruction deck

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.449 
weakness of Al and destruction deck
would<00:03:54.969> probably<00:03:55.480> be<00:03:55.599> a<00:03:55.629> control<00:03:56.200> deck<00:03:56.469> but

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
would probably be a control deck but

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.119 
would probably be a control deck but
that<00:03:58.150> goes<00:03:58.389> without<00:03:58.629> saying<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:59.439> well-designed

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
that goes without saying a well-designed

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.789 
that goes without saying a well-designed
control<00:04:00.700> deck<00:04:00.999> can<00:04:01.420> be<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.629> pain<00:04:01.959> and<00:04:02.200> anyone's

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
control deck can be a pain and anyone's

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.849 
control deck can be a pain and anyone's
add<00:04:03.069> another<00:04:03.969> weakness<00:04:04.599> for<00:04:04.870> dislike<00:04:05.439> in
