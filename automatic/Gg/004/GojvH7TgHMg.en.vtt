maxim<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.290> put<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.650> light<00:00:49.830> on<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> we

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
maxim just put some light on so that we

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630 
maxim just put some light on so that we
can<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:50.880> better<00:00:52.250> what<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.400> see

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
can see it a little better what we see

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.030 
can see it a little better what we see
here<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.840> fuel<00:00:55.940> regulator<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.360> petcock<00:00:58.230> s

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
here is the fuel regulator or petcock s

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.310 
here is the fuel regulator or petcock s
a<00:00:59.220> technical<00:00:59.730> name<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.360> reserve<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
a technical name and as a reserve to the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.520 
a technical name and as a reserve to the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.889 
left prime to the right prime to the
right<00:01:04.799> means<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.509> flow<00:01:07.170> fuel

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
right means that it will flow fuel

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.139 
right means that it will flow fuel
directly<00:01:09.899> without<00:01:10.229> any<00:01:10.469> suction<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> out

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
directly without any suction this is out

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.849 
directly without any suction this is out
of<00:01:12.179> vacuum<00:01:12.719> so<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:14.520> only<00:01:14.789> pulls<00:01:15.119> fuel<00:01:15.590> when<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
of vacuum so it only pulls fuel when the

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.289 
of vacuum so it only pulls fuel when the
engine<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.249> running<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.939> why<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
engine is running and that's why the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.679 
engine is running and that's why the
little<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:20.909> hose<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:21.869> back

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
little the little hose in the back

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.120 
little the little hose in the back
completes<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> vacuum<00:01:25.259> cycle<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.889> you<00:01:25.979> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
completes the vacuum cycle as you can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.539 
completes the vacuum cycle as you can
see<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.399> little<00:01:26.759> yellow<00:01:27.179> hose<00:01:28.490> now<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
see this little yellow hose now the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.940 
see this little yellow hose now the
black<00:01:30.030> hose<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.509> big<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:30.929> front<00:01:31.229> go

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
to the fuel rail you can see right there

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.539 
to the fuel rail you can see right there
is<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.369> fuel<00:01:35.819> filter<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.799> fuel<00:01:38.039> comes<00:01:38.310> out

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is a fuel filter so the fuel comes out

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.190 
is a fuel filter so the fuel comes out
of<00:01:38.639> the<00:01:38.729> tank<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> black<00:01:39.600> holes<00:01:39.899> into

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
motorcycle I'm not sure run into the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
motorcycle I'm not sure run into the
second<00:02:09.600> carb<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.770> first<00:02:11.040> carb<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
second carb this is the first carb you

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.589 
second carb this is the first carb you
can<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> little

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
can see the little

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.170 
can see the little
cap<00:02:14.200> right<00:02:14.590> there<00:02:15.599> but<00:02:16.599> this<00:02:17.590> one<00:02:18.069> runs<00:02:18.639> right

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
cap right there but this one runs right

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.690 
cap right there but this one runs right
into<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.749> a<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:19.989> black<00:02:20.230> run<00:02:21.189> into<00:02:21.609> the

into it's a little black run into the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.800 
into it's a little black run into the
number<00:02:22.060> two<00:02:22.480> carb<00:02:23.969> right<00:02:24.969> there<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.480> all<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
number two carb right there so all the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.149 
number two carb right there so all the

number two possibly number one depending

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.770 
number two possibly number one depending
on<00:02:30.280> how<00:02:30.489> its<00:02:30.670> set<00:02:30.849> up<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.120> really<00:02:31.450> don't<00:02:31.629> know

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.229 

and<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.840> should<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.409> so<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.400> big<00:02:36.790> line<00:02:37.030> is

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
and that should be it so the big line is

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.530 
and that should be it so the big line is
fuel<00:02:37.659> line<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.590> little<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.219> is<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.609> vacuum

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
fuel line the little one is a vacuum

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.750 
fuel line the little one is a vacuum
