00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.880 
together so I think there was a trust
that<00:02:34.370> coin<00:02:34.610> has<00:02:34.880> in<00:02:35.120> him<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.630> by<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:36.740> so

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
that coin has in him and by first so

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.100 
that coin has in him and by first so
