00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.580
 hello everyone knows the pin up 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 today we are on minecraft in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 company of 13 titles acquired 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 hi everyone so here we are 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.170
 for the third episode of the ain 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.029
 serve amap servers so a map 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.990
 that you can download for your 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 servers via a mediafire link that I 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 if you subscribe to the site 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.239
 you asked me this here I remember 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.059
 that this link is asked by comments 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 or by private message on my channel and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.710
 that priority pass subscribers 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.979
 so here to start this map a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 been asked by a youtube hours who 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:56.399
 is called judge 77 940 so we him 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.479
 we created this map for him but that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.879
 does not prevent other people 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.469
 can download it 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.469
 so that's a little dedication to you 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
 so on this map we have a spawn 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.610
 an inn a market a room 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 creating a bank a point of view and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.210
 accessible paths for future 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.500
 so trendy houses hunt in what 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 something is important about this 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.680
 map 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 the important thing is that this map 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 is available as an extra 6.2 or a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 weight if it's the same so if not if you 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.619
 download our version of you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.660
 will not have carpets and all objects 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.479
 decoration necessary this is all 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.240
 which comes from there in principle so during 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.689
 we are there 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.509
 we are going down to go down we have 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.100
 signs it's not us who explains 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.280
 that the tablecloth was built by our 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.630
 building team and by myself 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 with the help of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.200
 very small and nikki colossus there is there there 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.570
 is the link of my channel I would like that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.610
 these panels remains it's for me it's 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.610
 quite important because it shows 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.670
 as the map 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.710
 was worked by month by myself and 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.240
 than 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.830
 if you want if you change these 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.300
 panels these panels there saying that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.130
 it's you who created it etc 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.470
 I do not find that very correct and his 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.180
 watch 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.820
 it shows that you have no respect 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.010
 from the work of others so here I 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.930
 would find it obvious that people who 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.910
 download this map lets them 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.140
 panels as they are for them 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.270
 people there are signs with 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.370
 richness of the server 2.1 modo two points 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.350
 this is yours to complete her but of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.050
 four panels here let them is 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.440
 as they are here I find it normal 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.530
 that as you are given a map already 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.569
 made 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.660
 that's advertising for us it's a 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.770
 exchange so here I think we have more 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.900
 had anything we have nothing more to say without 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.450
 to say they do not necessarily have 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.730
 so down 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:09.600
 in five seconds we will you 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.590
 launch the trailer of the hand 5 4 3 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.590
 2 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.590
 1 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.590
 1 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.580
 hello my name 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.670
 so here I hope this little trailer 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.710
 you will have pleased me to be a title 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.590
 axa did not make us happy 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.670
 build that map for you so 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.280
 if you like it, you can 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.580
 leave a like a thumb green which 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.430
 shows us that you like 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.250

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.750
 that there are three is called a map 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.150

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.110

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.720
 two with them a boat somewhere else 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.160

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.980
