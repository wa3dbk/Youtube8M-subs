00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.559
 flexi soft the security control the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.719
 cleverly stringing together advantages 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.360
 It would not be cleverly different 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.580
 Safety switch and sensors fast 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.390
 and easy to integrate into a system 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.990
 on a variety of machines no matter in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990
 which industry 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.399
 that would be pretty clever , too 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.180
 to implement very cleverly 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.180
 with flexi soft it gets even smarter 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.480
 create cascading with flexi lud 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.090
 of up to 32 safety sensors all 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 common manufacturer 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 that does not mean big either 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.020
 Wiring but maximum safety at 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 minimum cost 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.329
 Diagnostic data always shows how it works 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.329
 if it works or not 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.520
 All this makes it flexible and cost-effective 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.920
 flexible and efficient or very easy 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.020
 really clever 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.420
 it's even smarter and thanks to the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.890
 modular hardware concept grows flexi 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 soft step by step with the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.990
 task setting and adapts so 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.520
 Perfect for all imaginable applications 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.150
 on 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.190
 software programmable easy to use 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.640
 serve 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.640
 flexibly compact and diagnostically supported 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.070
 and the smartest thing about it 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.799
 With flexible , they connect more than just 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.680
 machines with each other for example too 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.490
 big ideas that are easy to implement 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.049
 to let 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.159
 because who thinks big also networks big 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:06.049
 and addressing it for up to 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.080
 32 flexi soft stations and over 30,000 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.709
 meter all without additional 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.540
 hardware but with unlimited 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.620
 security 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.459
 So here is advantageous to advantage 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.459
 pretty clever or we will find the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 intelligent
