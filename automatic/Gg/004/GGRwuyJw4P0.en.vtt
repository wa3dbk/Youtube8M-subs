00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.190
 last week I liked my 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.980
 song 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.270
 and I agree with an opinion of the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 jury 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.140
 I must try harder this week where 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.070
 things I learned to raze a little grounds 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 and what I need is a few steps and I 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 I wait on stage to try and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.430
 get one hundred percent very well 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 christopher now let's listen to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 our dear to explore tell me about 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 please because this little one has 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.110
 so many combative energy to work 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.789
 with him it 's very funny but like you 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 you said he has a lot of energy and that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.730
 energy the help of a lot for the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.469
 character too but now you have to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.510
 control a little enter character 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 and nothing shining in the cinema is very good 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.870
 we are going to remember then the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.870
 true alex lora 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.989
 in the corners 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.890
 today with his controlled energy he sings to us 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.240
 all for the rock and roll with you 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 alex now 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.909
 I would like 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.909
 in a pool of blood 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.549
 the side of a final rope 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.969
 listening slowly 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.440
 I imagine 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.350
 I am dying 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.409
 and nothing more 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 You are the performer at length 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.509
 please stop by here let's listen to the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.819
 comment from our jury rodrigo 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.639
 he felt the vibration would tell him dead of 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:38.069
 truth has come out with a lot of energy in 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.830
 be this scraped that color of voice that 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.900
 has Alex Lora is very difficult for a 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.060
 child to get and you get close 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.580
 very much to the original so that's why 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.979
 It also impresses us now 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.199
 that energy with which you come out and with the 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.419
 that starts do not lose it to what 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.699
 throughout the song because you started in 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.699
 100 and you're finished like the 180 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.560
 has jumped like the state as it is 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.479
 true but you've finished that if I notice you 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.699
 exhausted you have to keep the energy to 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.670
 throughout the presentation that has 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.270
