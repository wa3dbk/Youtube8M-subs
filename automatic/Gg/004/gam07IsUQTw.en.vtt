 much in the national and world market 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.329
 the success of the German brand is due to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.970
 releases like the one we are 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 testing and the dynamism of the 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.989
 audio to speak first 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 I would like to thank you for the presence of 16 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.000
 times arise and in the event here of the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 Brazil is an honor for us. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.440

 then q3 is already a consecrated suv in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 premium market 1 is inclusive the car 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 most sold in 2015 of any segment 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.330
 premium to pick up all brands 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.910
 top of the market today because three is the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.500
 car in 2015 so this 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.210
 already shows that the car is in taste 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.520
 of the public and is a sales champion 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 now where it is bringing even more 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.450
 technology for the car even more 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.289
 quality with this version that is a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.910
 lift 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.070
 so we have some details on the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.229
 part of the car that bring more 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.539
 even more sporting the car leaves 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.160
 the look even more interesting and has

 also a new equipment package 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.130

 with a very affordable price 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.569
 competitive with the certainty that the consumer 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.160
 will start to function audi has great 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.929
 chance to close the deal 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.110
 perhaps not having the first audio 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.670
 people have enough is hot already walking 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.860
 already with problem is the quality of the cars 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.480
 more this is a car that is a door 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550

 closed best year of brand history 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.129
 in Brazil 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.910
 we had a growth of 90 per 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.040
 sales in relation to 2003 11 and 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 where he is now investing 500 million 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.060
 reais from Brazil in domestic production 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.120
 we are now producing in 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.620
 September the a3 sedan in Brazil that the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.349
 from the first half of the year 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.450
 comes also the audi q3 that car that 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.349
 are you meeting here today? 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.349
 mounted in brazil 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.060
 in addition to visual changes with a new 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.490
 the front grille of the model for 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.130
 shock renewed headlights now bi xenon 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.650
 in all versions and with fog light 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.830
 incorporated into a new lego feat 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.440
 line 2016 receives engine 1.4 tfsi and 150 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.210
 horses to the incoming versions 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.650
 while the more expensive a debut looks 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.260
 the settings of the known 2.0 tfsi 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.850
 now not 180 and 220 horses 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.100
 respectively 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.410
 these versions with a quiet one 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.280
 deficit and also with seven gears 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.040
 and 1.4 liter double clutch follows s 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.460
 tronic six-speed is us 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.460
 we have expanded the use of engines that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.630
 has double injection so now we have 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.410
 q3 two engines where 181 of the angels of 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.340
 horses that have direct injection and injection 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.350
 indirect 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.630
 With that we optimized a little bit 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.300
 plus the use of the car decreases a 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.520
 little more the mission of shock is is the 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.870
 Today's great attraction is you 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.830
 eventually to the size of the motor at 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.110
 its rotation and can dispatch the 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.220
 pollutants but do not lose 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.170
 sportiness 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.730
 because otherwise there is no grace cortaz 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.150
 before the subject does not walk another 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.640
 business him to walk in a better way 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.430
 adapting the vehicle to the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.120
 your course really project because we 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.900
 we brought here the 1.4 engine and traction 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.540
 because the research done in the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.750
 showed that a good part is a large 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.820
 part of these cars are used in 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.430
 urban route 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.220
 if the person has a route 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.080
 the fruit is off the road to make it 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.510
 there are two cars available 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.790
 beyond this first and we allow a 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.370
 there is a greater distribution an access 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.500
 best for this type of vehicle 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.660
 You still have a car that does not 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.050
 it takes ten seconds to reach 100 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.670
 per hour has a performance of 204 km per 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.770
 Not now that we're going to walk this 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.540
 speed but you continue with a 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.570
 extremely safe car in terms of 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.970
 answer if you need to be something else 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.730
 to quickly overtake and avoid the car 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.380
 that comes in the opposite direction anyway you 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.810
 has that answer 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.680
 and even then you have a car that is 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.640
 1.4 on the urban or average circuit 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.950
 velocity 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.660
 Are you going to have an extremely car? 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.930
 and that no road will 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.630
 respond as a much larger engine for 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.450
 account of having acted and in direct injection 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.220
 fuel and the other data that the 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.330
 people passed you there modifications 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.900
 internal friction - more friction 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.900
 motor spin 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.570
 internally, the model has few 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.240
 changes in finish and equipment 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.260
 depending on the version maintaining refinement and 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.360
 comfort 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.210
 the panel has a modern design and 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:04.850
 ergonomics is excellent a great position 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:07.520
 to drive the q3 is the good swu of driving 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.480
 compact on the outside but roomy for 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.720
 inside 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.360
 walks much less in version 1.4 and has price 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.070
 attractive within the segment 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.030
 finally the car that is worth being 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.030
 known closely
