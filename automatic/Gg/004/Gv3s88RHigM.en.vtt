power<00:02:25.720> longer<00:02:26.720> run<00:02:26.900> times<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.650> day<00:02:28.010> nights<00:02:28.570> it

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
power longer run times a day nights it

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.930 
power longer run times a day nights it
was<00:02:29.630> an<00:02:29.780> incredible<00:02:30.170> motor<00:02:30.380> he<00:02:30.890> was<00:02:31.040> about<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
was an incredible motor he was about to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
start on the first one this is little

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:44.650 
start on the first one this is little

as<00:02:45.350> well<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.280> was<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.600> sorry<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.690> venom

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
as well in it but it was a sorry a venom

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.650 
as well in it but it was a sorry a venom
ESC<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.830> was<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> pain<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.490> bum<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.540> we

ESC it was a pain in the bum so we

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.710 
ESC it was a pain in the bum so we
started<00:02:51.020> using<00:02:51.430> just<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.610> Nova<00:02:53.150> tech<00:02:53.360> one<00:02:53.570> I

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
started using just the Nova tech one I

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.860 
started using just the Nova tech one I
think<00:02:53.840> it's<00:02:54.020> an<00:02:54.080> 80s<00:02:54.380> 75<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.250> over<00:02:55.940> tech<00:02:56.150> with

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
think it's an 80s 75 in over tech with

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.860 
think it's an 80s 75 in over tech with
the<00:02:57.080> venom<00:02:57.620> motor<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.310> second<00:02:58.670> motor<00:02:58.870> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the venom motor that's a second motor I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.050 
the venom motor that's a second motor I
don't<00:03:00.350> recommend<00:03:00.650> anyone<00:03:01.010> by<00:03:01.250> venom<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.970> know

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
the venom motor out but like I said

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.750 
the venom motor out but like I said
before<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.570> is<00:03:59.720> venom<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:01.640> is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
before that is venom and this is

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.040 
before that is venom and this is
probably<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.090> best<00:04:02.240> thing<00:04:02.480> we<00:04:02.600> did<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.900> it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
my next motor not only impressed with it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.110 
my next motor not only impressed with it
much<00:05:22.660> prefer<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:22.990> keep<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.380> other<00:05:23.530> one<00:05:24.120> in

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120
