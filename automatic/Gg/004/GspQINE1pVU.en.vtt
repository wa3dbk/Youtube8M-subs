00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 so nice to crack the piggy bank now 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.549
 because in October a whole 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.960
 lots of new game and which one exactly 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.960
 see for yourself 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 Let's start with the bawler of the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.720
 months 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.650
 Destiny added the echo to the beta 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.539
 phase is split which cheers one 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 bungies new franchise the others 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.789
 sober down that the big one 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.700
 play revolution then somehow 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 What is missing , especially with it 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 do that destiny has finally 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 much more shooter than roleplay 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.550
 is the scifi mmo is still one of the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:53.129
 biggest hits this year 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:55.500
 no question a few days earlier 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.289
 namely on the fourth of september appears 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.780
 the fourth part of the sims to the features 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.120
 count a new emotions system of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 advanced creators in the mode and the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.159
 fact that the sims do the multitasking 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 have learned and so now several 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.560
 Things can do at the same time well 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720
 I see that more so who likes the sims 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.850
 who will also buy part 4 and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.450
 everyone else is just as interested 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450
 as previously 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 dynasty warriors with zelda finally gives 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.130
 it again supply for the julius 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.900
 is a hack'n'slay up to two players 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.759
 that means with link and more 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.670
 playable characters from the transmitter 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.820
 universe you pretzelt you 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.590
 tirelessly through enemy hordes we have 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.710
 the whole already played and 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.180
 say after first impression yes 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.560
 actually quite fun but the graphics 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.560
 is really disappointing 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 The annual FIFA is as safe as that 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.739
 name in the church 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 and of course, ea sports also promises 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.310
 in this year's part in rows 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.160
 improvements such as one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.830
 completely new control 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.480
 well fans continue to attack and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.870
 maybe the world champion title will take care of that 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.940
 this year even for new players 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 Curiously, by the way, fifa 15 appears 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.730
 really on all common systems 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:38.650
 not on the wii but on the you 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:40.239
 you have to understand that so im 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.190
 fast run here a few more 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.980
 further new phenomena for example 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.090
 this year's hockey update ms11 15 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.709
 that for ps3 xbox 360 xbox one on the eleventh 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.170
 september goes ice 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.790
 really groundbreaking innovations 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.910
 but you do not need to be here too 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.910
 expect 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.830
 The same is true for naruto shippuden 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.560
 ultimate ninja storm the evolution the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.960
 on the twelfth of september for ps3 and xbox 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.490
 360 appears and probably only 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.680
 appealing to hardcore fans 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.210
 They can then get over 100 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.950
 playable characters of the anime series 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.950
 slap on the snout 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.050
 Natural doctrine is a tactical one 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.910
 roleplaying of cardo cover games in the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.520
 her dark mine for a raw material 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.270
 called pluto and searched 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.700
 hints monster bump can also be 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.490
 cooperative in online mode and then 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.510
 cross play with ps3 ps4 and vita players 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.510
 moved simultaneously 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.470
 with wikis 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.160
 Tricky thrillers are there 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.080
 Meanwhile with sherlock holmes crimes and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.480
 Punishment in the role of 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.459
 Master detective you should six dubious 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.740
 solve cases collects for it indicia 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.840
 interrogate and testify 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.600
 or other moral decision 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.790
 the whole thing is only white on the unreal 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:38.490
 engine 3 and therefore looks a bit 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:40.290
 fancier than the predecessors now 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.810
 makes two little games for people 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.520
 who own the 3ds 1 comes from level 5 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.520
 and 1 comes from square enix 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.589
 this plays title is a punishment for 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.629
 everyone speaks however after detailed 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:03.139
 I am almost sure he will be researching 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:05.389
 goes tore pronounced fourth 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.399
 final fantasy 14 court is a 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.709
 music game in which you are the familiar 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:12.049
 sounds of over 200 no gentlemen 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:15.610
 agreement with the stylus on the 

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:15.610
 touchscreen will slip around 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.629
 a classic roleplaying game 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:30.479
 however, level 5 instead of so 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.369
 Professor Layton series with series 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.499

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:36.300
