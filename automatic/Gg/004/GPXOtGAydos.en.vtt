00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.330
 in my opinion are close all spinning 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.540
 bait can be divided into two main 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.170
 groups are bait and yes and bait 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.119
 reactions 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.750
 that is, those bait for which the fish 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.640
 reacts when he wants to eat something and those 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.500
 lures to which fish react 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.080
 just because she responds to them 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.670
 it's hard for us to sit and talk now 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.129
 why does she react to them for not 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.260
 less she rushes them it can 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.090
 be aggression it may be of interest it 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.890
 maybe some kind of game I'm honest 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.070
 say don't know what exactly makes her 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.360
 attack but nonetheless she attacks 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.120
 purebred reaction bait so market 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.199
 in Russian conditions they are not so 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.760
 prevalent though worldwide and 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:57.619
 most of all in america probably this is us 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.930
 not afraid of the word bait number 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.449
 one that is half the time 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.369
 and even more than half of the cases 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.580
 one of the most successful bait 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.320
 bait is exactly crank 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.150
 because he always catches ie 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.650
 sometimes a predator is fed 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.480
 happens predator not in the mood he's in 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.030
 some kind of passive state lies on 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.520
 bottom but since the market is this bait 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.220
 reactions 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.800
 she is in more cases his 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.510
 raises and makes attack so here 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.270
 catching earlier catching in Russian conditions 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.170
 in depths of three and a half four five 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.030
 and even 6 meters was regarded as only 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.950
 the direction is jig that is for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.650
 these depths most often used 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.890
 Jack there let's say easy jig in area 8 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.360
 10 12 14 grams again depending on 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.840
 use used use 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 specific diameter of the braid but quite 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.910
 recently just a few years ago 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.560
 fairly widespread 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.020
 especially among athletes received 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.580
 fishing on the krenki and every year she 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.860
 only gaining and gaining momentum 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.810
 blades we catch another fish completely 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.510
 another as I have already said, that is, the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 which is not configured for food at all 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.900
 recently in the second stage of the floor with andrew 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.980
 live us when we fished in Rybinsk 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.050
 the reservoir were were was let's say 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 even a series of illustrative examples when we 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.720
 fishing a particular place with 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.040
 jig lobbies bait one pike 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.140
 and sometimes there were no bites later 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:49.100
 inserted krenki and which go on 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.000
 at a depth of 4 4 and a half five meters and with 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.060
 some points 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.630
 gave another 2 poured in 3 pieces that is 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.190
 it clearly reflects 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.500
 the fish that was happening was clearly not 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.970
 tuned to food but nonetheless to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.390
 lure reaction she attacked 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.300
 good enough very interesting catching 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.880
 on krenki at maximum depths that is 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.680
 many krenki 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.950
 tart that really catch cast 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.010
 their horizon is limited 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.940
 a depth of about four and a half well, 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.860
 probably a maximum of 5 meters to reach 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.959
 6 meters deep can be a little bit 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.970
 cheat after casting we rods 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.680
 Well, besides what you need initially 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.780
 drive except your working depth 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.519
 at least three and a half where three three with 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.000
 then reach half a meter 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.430
 great depths we tip our rod 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.730
 keep not near water but we lower 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.310
 rod to the maximum down that is it 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.709
 we add extra meters there and a half to 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.019
 deep buried deep in the aisles 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.450
 this krenka that is instead of four with 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.950
 by half 5 meters it starts to go on 6 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.230
 meters is another story and 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.410
 fish standing in snags if she has a crank 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.660
 passes overhead there in the distance 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.549
 meter and a half she may not attack 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.350
 that is, all the same tap must 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.630
 periodically graze for these snags in 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.550
 which costs fish either for the bottom or for 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.129
 stones sunset behind which again stands 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.819
 predator and at the same time probably 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.439
 efficiency krank just 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.389
 rises at times when he is 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:35.110
 touches for the obstacles for which 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.110
 worth predator
