subsequently the new embryos were
destroyed<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> process<00:01:39.229> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.770> a

lead to rejection free transplants and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.139 
lead to rejection free transplants and

research<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.209> still<00:02:14.510> hotly<00:02:14.750> debated<00:02:15.260> when<00:02:15.950> is

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.130 
research is still hotly debated when is
life<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:17.299> need<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.569> funk<00:02:17.780> around<00:02:18.049> with

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
life and do we need to funk around with

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.750 
life and do we need to funk around with
embryonic<00:02:18.349> stem<00:02:18.799> cells<00:02:19.040> when<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:19.519> have

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
embryonic stem cells when we now have

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.059 
embryonic stem cells when we now have
the<00:02:19.940> ability<00:02:20.299> to<00:02:20.330> induce<00:02:20.900> other<00:02:21.230> cells<00:02:21.590> into

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
the ability to induce other cells into

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.660 
the ability to induce other cells into
stem<00:02:22.129> cells

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
stem cells

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.070 
stem cells
maybe<00:02:22.849> we<00:02:23.030> should<00:02:23.209> continue<00:02:23.480> down<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:23.870> path

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
maybe we should continue down that path

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.780 
maybe we should continue down that path
even<00:02:24.680> though<00:02:24.799> at<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.099> time<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.519> are<00:02:25.549> some

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
even though at this time there are some

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.460 
even though at this time there are some
perceived<00:02:26.120> genetic<00:02:26.510> abnormalities<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
perceived genetic abnormalities and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380

you<00:02:32.239> know<00:02:32.450> what<00:02:32.599> question<00:02:33.200> how<00:02:33.410> do<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.890> guys

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
you know what question how do you guys

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.400 
you know what question how do you guys
feel<00:02:34.549> about<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.000> because<00:02:35.360> we<00:02:35.540> clearly<00:02:35.959> are

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
feel about this because we clearly are

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.140 
feel about this because we clearly are
torn<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.250> we're<00:02:37.340> trying<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.700> figure<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:37.970> out

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
torn and we're trying to figure it out

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.430 
torn and we're trying to figure it out
ourselves<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.690> let's<00:02:38.720> know<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> comments

a book on this yeah we got a man
research<00:02:46.069> I'll<00:02:46.400> make<00:02:46.760> sure<00:02:46.910> it's<00:02:47.060> nice<00:02:47.180> my

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480

we<00:02:47.989> should<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.379> opinions<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:49.099> want<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.400> be

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
we should have opinions I want to be
