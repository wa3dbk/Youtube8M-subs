00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.100 

and<00:01:30.340> I'll<00:01:30.640> just<00:01:30.730> tighten<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.240> bolt<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.720> and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
and I'll just tighten the bolt on and

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.740 
and I'll just tighten the bolt on and
that'll<00:01:32.710> be<00:01:32.800> it<00:01:36.000> after<00:01:37.000> using<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.480> little<00:01:37.630> bit

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
that'll be it after using a little bit

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.690 
that'll be it after using a little bit
of<00:01:37.840> muffler<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.290> tailpipe<00:01:38.920> sealer<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.550> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
of muffler and tailpipe sealer on the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.530 
of muffler and tailpipe sealer on the
threads<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:42.660> all<00:01:43.660> over<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.290> place<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:45.540> think

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
threads and all over the place I think

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.470 
threads and all over the place I think
that<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:48.130> problem<00:01:48.580> with<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.880> nuts<00:01:49.090> coming

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
that the problem with the nuts coming

00:01:49.480 --> 00:02:45.720 
that the problem with the nuts coming
loose<00:01:49.690> while<00:01:50.080> you're<00:01:50.350> driving<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.190> probably

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.140 

and<00:02:46.730> screwdriver<00:02:47.300> would<00:02:47.569> probably<00:02:48.140> work<00:02:48.319> best

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
and screwdriver would probably work best

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:06.670 
and screwdriver would probably work best
there's<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.209> little<00:02:50.450> bit<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.690> space<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.200> top<00:03:03.670> hey
