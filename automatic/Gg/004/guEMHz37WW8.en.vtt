00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello today we will introduce you to 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.670
 model and average price segment 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.620
 huawei ascend g700 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
 for an estimated $ 290 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.509
 user gets 5 inch ips 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.180
 display quad processor 2 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.199
 gigabytes of ram 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.189
 8 megapixel camera and support 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.840
 dual-sim mode 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.240
 however, only these possibilities 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.670
 devices are not limited to housing 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.269
 new ascend g700 is folded from plastic 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.510
 details 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.650
 which however is logical given the price tag 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 matte type is dominant 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 material from it here back panel + 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.149
 more than half of the sides 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 the rest is gloss visually and yes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.750
 tactile including it seems that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 brushed plastic polished or 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.950
 has some kind of special coating 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.750
 word oily fingerprint 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 leave here is not difficult 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.829
 accurately build quality even 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.449
 despite the fact that in our hands 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.610
 visited an engineering copy of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.160
 representation claims did not cause 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.440
 fit elements at the appropriate level and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.460
 here are the materials themselves slightly but all 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.920
 same creak 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 but for this sample this state of affairs 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 not a disaster menu navigation 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 Yes, and management can be called convenient 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.280
 although a little dodge user 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.560
 it is necessary, however personally 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 strained front of the smartphone 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 divided between a large display 13 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 cheese buttons 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.250
 as well as the voice of the front 13 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950
 megapixel camera 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 conversational dynamics profile 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.880
 event indicator sensors 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.579
 approximation of the rear body orientation 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 the panel has the output of the main 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.619
 8 megapixel camera LED 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.689
 flashes 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.540
 speakerphone and microphone 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.400
 noise reduction inspecting the right side 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.960
 face user meet on it 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.600
 power on button 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.250
 apparatus from the opposite edge 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.189
 open access to the paired key

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.840
 5 mm to the bottom port of micro usb 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.299
 + output built-in microphone huawei 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.439
 g700 got 5 inch ips display

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.680
 pixels per inch 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.490
 These 94 viewing angles are quite good as 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.980
 vertically 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.840
 so and horizontal while working in 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.910
 conditions hit on the solar panel 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.840
 light defined extinction data 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.550
 there is a place to be 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.490
 however say that the extent of it 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.560
 critical i cant display backlight 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.750
 adjustable both manually and 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.880
 automatic sensitivity 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.980
 claims no cause supported 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.770
 touch control with 10 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.630
 fingers at the same time the device on the display 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.480
 covered with material tactile 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.370
 resembling glass certainly believe that 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.890
 here the gorilla voice or its closest 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.320
 analogue is at least naive considering 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.930
 the fact that we are talking about a smartphone for 290 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.120
 dollars however friction over the edge panel 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.220
 coins were not enough to 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.200
 leave a mark here so 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.959
 certain protective properties 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.820
 this cover is still endowed with volume 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.280
 built-in user memory 8 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.709

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 hours before you test results 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.380
 performance of any settings 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.530
 power saving mode is not provided

 two separate handsfree speaker and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.239
 also conversational to their abilities 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.280
 I have no complaints loudness 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.260
 enough for mp3 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.720
 so for the video in a closed from 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.180
 the external premises of the telephone itself 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.459
 conversations are also burdensome even 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.650
 if you communicate being on the avenue 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.200

 smartphone portal yuri 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.460
 what about its $ 290 value 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.710
 This unit looks really 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.700
 interesting of the closest competitors 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.620
 one hundred percent alternative in this 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.770
 The price range will be found extremely 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.770
 complicated
