00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
week and this month we've seen a large

week and this month we've seen a large
number<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.790> iphone<00:00:06.720> 5s<00:00:07.259> leaks<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.000> they're

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
number of iphone 5s leaks and they're

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.520 
number of iphone 5s leaks and they're
pretty<00:00:09.240> much<00:00:09.300> confirming<00:00:09.929> what<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.290> already

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
pretty much confirming what we already

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.350 
pretty much confirming what we already
thought<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.190> what<00:00:11.730> analysts<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.330> been

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
thought and what analysts have been

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.060 
thought and what analysts have been
telling<00:00:12.719> us<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.380> past<00:00:13.530> couple<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:14.009> months

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
telling us for the past couple of months

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.029 
telling us for the past couple of months
the<00:00:14.460> iphone<00:00:15.089> 5s<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.350> expect<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.770> fall

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the iphone 5s which we expect this fall

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.880 
the iphone 5s which we expect this fall
should<00:00:17.609> look<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> lot<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.900> iphone<00:00:18.930> 5

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
should look a lot like the iphone 5

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
should look a lot like the iphone 5
right<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:20.939> we're<00:00:21.119> looking<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.570> some<00:00:22.320> leaked

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
right now we're looking at some leaked

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.529 
right now we're looking at some leaked
iphone<00:00:23.150> 5<00:00:24.150> display<00:00:24.930> panels<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.300> from<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.480> we

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
iphone 5 display panels so from these we

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.509 
iphone 5 display panels so from these we
can't<00:00:27.990> tell<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:29.010> higher

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
can't tell if there's a higher

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.800 
can't tell if there's a higher
resolution<00:00:29.820> display<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.420> anything<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
resolution display or anything like that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.740 
resolution display or anything like that
but<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.439> tell<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> looks<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
but we can tell that it looks about the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.040 
but we can tell that it looks about the
same<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.559> iphone<00:00:35.130> 5<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.600> we

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
same as the iphone 5 so with that we

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.440 
same as the iphone 5 so with that we
expect<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.890> screen<00:00:38.399> size<00:00:38.460> 4<00:00:39.090> inch<00:00:39.210> size

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
expect the same screen size 4 inch size

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.380 
expect the same screen size 4 inch size
and<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.230> same<00:00:40.469> overall<00:00:40.890> design<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and the same overall design now that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990 
and the same overall design now that
matches<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> leak<00:00:44.040> logic<00:00:44.730> board

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
matches up with a leak logic board

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
matches up with a leak logic board
that's<00:00:45.300> basically<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> part<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> iphone

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that's basically the part of the iphone

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.910 
that's basically the part of the iphone
5<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.700> controls<00:00:48.390> everything<00:00:49.050> that's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
5 that controls everything that's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.290 
5 that controls everything that's
probably<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> most<00:00:50.520> expensive<00:00:50.969> part<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
probably the most expensive part of the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.470 
probably the most expensive part of the
iphone<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.860> appears<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> fit<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.850> with

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
iphone and it appears to fit in with

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.069 
iphone and it appears to fit in with
this<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:55.289> screen<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.629> case

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
this new screen we also have case

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
this new screen we also have case
manufacturers<00:00:59.070> getting<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> point<00:01:00.329> where

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
manufacturers getting to the point where

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.590 
manufacturers getting to the point where
they<00:01:00.780> feel<00:01:01.050> comfortable<00:01:01.820> starting<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.210> build

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
they feel comfortable starting to build

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
they feel comfortable starting to build
designs<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.979> some<00:01:05.220> blueprints

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
designs and so we have some blueprints

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
designs and so we have some blueprints
these<00:01:06.150> come<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.330> Apple<00:01:06.750> Insider<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.740> show

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
these come from Apple Insider that show

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.630 
these come from Apple Insider that show
the<00:01:08.610> iphone<00:01:09.210> 5s<00:01:10.170> should<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the iphone 5s should look a lot like the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
the iphone 5s should look a lot like the
iphone<00:01:11.850> 5<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> major<00:01:13.619> differences<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
iphone 5 one of the major differences is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.469 
iphone 5 one of the major differences is
a<00:01:14.760> pill<00:01:15.090> shaped<00:01:15.360> dual<00:01:15.750> LED<00:01:16.049> flash<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> back

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
a pill shaped dual LED flash on the back

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
a pill shaped dual LED flash on the back
now<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> might<00:01:18.810> mean<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.110> some<00:01:19.590> iphone<00:01:19.979> 5

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
now this might mean that some iphone 5

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
now this might mean that some iphone 5
cases<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.060> tweaked<00:01:21.540> or

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
cases will need to be tweaked or

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.560 
cases will need to be tweaked or
re-engineered<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.979> fit<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> 5s<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.299> flash

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
re-engineered to fit the 5s so the flash

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
re-engineered to fit the 5s so the flash
doesn't<00:01:24.900> hit<00:01:25.140> part<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> case<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.340> overall

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
doesn't hit part of the case but overall

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.590 
doesn't hit part of the case but overall
the<00:01:28.049> iphone<00:01:28.560> 5s<00:01:29.070> should<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> lot<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the iphone 5s should look a lot like the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.859 
the iphone 5s should look a lot like the
iphone<00:01:30.720> 5<00:01:31.470> right<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.630> analysts<00:01:33.630> that's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
iphone 5 right now analysts that's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.249 
iphone 5 right now analysts that's
plural<00:01:34.200> agree<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.060> iphone<00:01:36.450> 5s<00:01:36.900> launch

Verizon and eighteen t do early upgrades
a<00:01:55.079> practice<00:01:55.500> they're<00:01:55.649> getting<00:01:55.829> rid<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
a practice they're getting rid of but is

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
a practice they're getting rid of but is
still<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> place<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:57.920> most<00:01:58.920> users
