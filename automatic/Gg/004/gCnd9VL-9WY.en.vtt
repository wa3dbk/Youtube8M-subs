00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.650
 hello dear friends we already 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.360
 learned to cut beautifully on us and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.270
 serve it today i will teach you to cut 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.510
 pomegranate without waste 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:48.250
 which waste i mean of course 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.379
 juice when we cut a pomegranate in half or on 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.890
 parts or whatever we lose 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.730
 many many juice which is very useful and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.579
 really need not to spoil the fruit 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.520
 wrong cut 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.030
 learn how to cut a grenade correctly so 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:14.430
 let's start taking pomegranate and cut off the cap 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:20.759
 we do not cut off completely, but we just cut 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.759
 cut the skin in a circle like this 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.759
 notching 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:42.110
 try here and so try to remove 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.910
 evident that we will remove the cap easily here 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.490
 already and the grains are separated but it is not 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.890
 scary they are not damaged them always 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.200
 fruit salads can be used 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:01.700
 salads other salads just for food 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:05.770
 that's great that's great 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.930
 cut a little bit in this midst 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.300
 so what we see now we see what 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.020
 pomegranate is divided into sections 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.910
 we can see here it is and drive in an hour 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.680
 scales that are inside the fruit 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.360
 now we need around the perimeter 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.330
 incise the skin's parallel here 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.220
 these lines inside the garnet that is also 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:42.080
 slightly incise the skin to this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:47.330
 places to tail and so around 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:53.800
 slightly incise the perimeter here is the section 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.800
 so we are notching here and so in a circle 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.350
 somewhere a tap from being divided about like this 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.350
 equal sectors like an orange 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.800
 neatly in no hurry 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.450
 so here 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:29.180
 we cut the last to do 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:37.420
 us a middle knife and crank 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.420
 his now open grenade 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.730
 when we have a middle in ticino not 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:57.480
 It is easy divided grenade 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:04:02.810
 section better take it alone 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:10.050
 now you can clean it very easily 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:14.640
 These plyonochku remove side 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:20.239
 we remove the film perfectly 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.239
 we have whole grains of pens 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:27.690
 juice flowing nowhere does not flow 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.150
 none of the neck we have not lost 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.750
 she did not have a single seed 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.580
 all precious iso our 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.850

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.810
 pomegranate can be served as a table 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.640
