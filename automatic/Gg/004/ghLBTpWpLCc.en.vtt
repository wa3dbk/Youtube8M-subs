00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
of vanilla and then that takes over to a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.640 
of vanilla and then that takes over to a
more<00:02:37.459> spicy<00:02:37.970> flavor<00:02:38.270> almost<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.440> little

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
more spicy flavor almost a little

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.180 
more spicy flavor almost a little
cinnamon<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> aftertaste

cinnamon in it and then the aftertaste
is<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.910> bad<00:02:44.300> but<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.990> a<00:02:45.110> little<00:02:45.290> harsher<00:02:45.800> than

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
is a bad but it's a little harsher than

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.030 
is a bad but it's a little harsher than
some<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.580> other<00:02:46.700> rums<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.080> commonly

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
some of the other rums that I commonly

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.400 
some of the other rums that I commonly
drink<00:02:49.570> but<00:02:50.570> all<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:50.990> pretty<00:02:51.320> good<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:54.170> next

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
drink but all in all pretty good so next

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.309

I'm<00:02:54.650> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.830> try<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.070> room<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.670> rocks

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
I'm going to try the room on the rocks

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.710 
I'm going to try the room on the rocks
having<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.380> rum<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.920> rocks<00:02:58.130> versus<00:02:58.850> meat<00:02:59.180> at

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
having a rum on the rocks versus meat at

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.300 
having a rum on the rocks versus meat at
room<00:02:59.989> temperature<00:03:00.470> can<00:03:00.920> make<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.100> big

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
room temperature can make a big

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.170 
room temperature can make a big
difference<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.940> flavor<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:04.760> put<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.000> few

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
difference in the flavor just put a few

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.660 
difference in the flavor just put a few
cubes<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.780> glass<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:07.459> pour<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.090> rum<00:03:08.269> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
cubes in the glass and pour the rum in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.479 
cubes in the glass and pour the rum in
and<00:03:10.670> then<00:03:10.820> I'll<00:03:10.910> just<00:03:11.060> give<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.480> second<00:03:11.930> to

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
and then I'll just give that a second to

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:28.600 
and then I'll just give that a second to
to<00:03:13.489> chill<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:27.200> children<00:03:27.709> does<00:03:28.130> take<00:03:28.430> on<00:03:28.550> a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
to chill the children does take on a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.520 
to chill the children does take on a
very<00:03:28.850> different<00:03:29.209> flavor<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:31.130> butteriness

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
very different flavor the butteriness

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.380 
very different flavor the butteriness
goes<00:03:33.530> down<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.829> little<00:03:34.100> bit<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.820> there's

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
goes down a little bit and there's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.970 
goes down a little bit and there's
actually<00:03:35.720> more<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:35.900> an<00:03:36.049> oaky<00:03:36.440> flavor<00:03:36.560> that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980

comes<00:03:37.130> through<00:03:37.989> there<00:03:38.989> was<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.140> little<00:03:39.380> bit<00:03:39.560> of

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
comes through there was a little bit of

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
at room temperature but this brought

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.330 
at room temperature but this brought
that<00:03:44.239> oaky<00:03:44.600> flavor<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:45.230> lot<00:03:45.470> further<00:03:46.190> through

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
that oaky flavor a lot further through

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.000
