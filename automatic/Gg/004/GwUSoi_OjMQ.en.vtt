00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
promised larger screens and we've lived

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
promised larger screens and we've lived
up<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.770> year<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
up to that and of this year now of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
up to that and of this year now of
course<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:52.020> fuller<00:00:52.320> members<00:00:52.680> want

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
course the one thing fuller members want

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
course the one thing fuller members want
in<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.129> we've<00:00:53.309> been<00:00:53.340> hearing<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
in all we've been hearing about all that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.010 
in all we've been hearing about all that
for<00:00:54.980> let's<00:00:55.980> say<00:00:56.160> five<00:00:56.219> six<00:00:56.699> years<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> no

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
for let's say five six years now and no

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
for let's say five six years now and no
one's<00:00:58.260> produced<00:00:58.649> anything<00:00:58.949> over<00:00:59.309> 30<00:00:59.550> inches

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
one's produced anything over 30 inches

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.599 
one's produced anything over 30 inches
so<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.590> issue<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> technology

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so it's an issue with the technology

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
so it's an issue with the technology
growing<00:01:03.030> larger<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> something<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
growing larger and is it something that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.990 
growing larger and is it something that
you're<00:01:04.439> working<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.860> absolutely<00:01:05.760> something

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you're working on absolutely something

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're working on absolutely something
we're<00:01:06.150> working<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> mean<00:01:06.780> we've<00:01:06.990> been

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
we're working on I mean we've been

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
we're working on I mean we've been
working<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> last<00:01:08.490> three<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.670> four

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
working on it for the last three or four

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
working on it for the last three or four
years<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.330> LED<00:01:09.600> technology<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.229> are

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
years you know LED technology we are

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
years you know LED technology we are
pioneering<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.250> technology<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.479> are

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
pioneering this technology we are

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
pioneering this technology we are
backing<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.500> technology<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.220> believe

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
backing this technology and we believe

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
backing this technology and we believe
that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> delivers<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.590> ultimate<00:01:16.619> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that it just delivers the ultimate in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
that it just delivers the ultimate in
picture<00:01:17.549> quality<00:01:17.580> which<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.450> people

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
picture quality which is what people

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
picture quality which is what people
want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.009> design<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
want to see the design of it is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.429 
want to see the design of it is
obviously<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> biggest<00:01:21.600> talking<00:01:21.960> point<00:01:22.320> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
obviously the biggest talking point in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.380 
obviously the biggest talking point in
terms<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.369> depth<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.240> two

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
terms of the depth of it just it's two

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.300 
terms of the depth of it just it's two
point<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:25.229> point<00:01:25.409> nine<00:01:25.560> millimeters<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
point two point nine millimeters it is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
point two point nine millimeters it is
absolutely<00:01:26.790> phenomenal<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.780> only<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> matter

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
absolutely phenomenal it's only a matter

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
absolutely phenomenal it's only a matter
of<00:01:28.409> time<00:01:28.530> before<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.130> 31<00:01:29.820> inches<00:01:30.090> becomes<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of time before the 31 inches becomes a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.370 
of time before the 31 inches becomes a
reality<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.439> UK<00:01:32.009> households<00:01:32.280> very<00:01:32.790> soon<00:01:33.119> and

reality in UK households very soon and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
reality in UK households very soon and
beyond<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:35.040> gonna<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.490> increase

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
beyond that it's gonna it will increase

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
beyond that it's gonna it will increase
in<00:01:36.060> size<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.540> sure<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.869> absolutely<00:01:37.140> calm<00:01:37.409> I'm

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
in size I'm sure I'm absolutely calm I'm

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
in size I'm sure I'm absolutely calm I'm
confident<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
confident of that I know you don't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
confident of that I know you don't
publicly<00:01:39.570> talk<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:40.020> roadmaps<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.040> mean

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
publicly talk about roadmaps but I mean

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.210 
publicly talk about roadmaps but I mean
is<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.119> likely<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
is it likely we're going to see this in

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.749 
is it likely we're going to see this in
2010<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.640> expect<00:01:44.939> next<00:01:45.450> year<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.409> be

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
2010 I would expect next year and to be

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.429
