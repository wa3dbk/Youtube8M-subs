00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210

by saying strange indeed also not true

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.030

so<00:02:24.780> yeah<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> think<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:25.470> safe<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.680> say<00:02:25.830> that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
so yeah I think it's safe to say that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.700 
so yeah I think it's safe to say that
the<00:02:26.460> order<00:02:26.700> 1886<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.600> definitely<00:02:28.140> longer<00:02:28.380> than

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the order 1886 is definitely longer than

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.880 
the order 1886 is definitely longer than
five<00:02:28.980> hours<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.720> nervous<00:02:31.470> about

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
five hours I'm just very nervous about

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.630 
five hours I'm just very nervous about
this<00:02:32.160> game<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.180> order<00:02:33.480> 1886<00:02:33.930> sucks<00:02:34.710> it's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
this game if the order 1886 sucks it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
this game if the order 1886 sucks it's
the<00:02:35.850> first<00:02:36.120> time<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> eighth<00:02:37.020> generation

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
game at least it's art style and its

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.080 
game at least it's art style and its
visuals<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.960> reminds<00:02:43.470> me<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.890> like<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.130> third

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
