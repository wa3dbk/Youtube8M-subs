00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.750
I remember a clumsy girl, hiding behind glasses

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.660
I was just a lonely boy, always skipping classes

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.340
We came from different worlds,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.919
it didn’t slow us down.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.919
Who knew? Who knew?

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.860
I remember love like fire, hands held tight

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.160
I was barely getting by, but your eyes were
lights.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.320
You decided to take a chance,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.640
Take a chance on me.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.629
Who knew? Who knew?

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.629
Who knew we'd grow up and out of this town
and all the

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.550
places we'd go now?

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.120
Who knew the troubles we'd overcome,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.149
Who knew?

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.760
Who knew the barriers we'd tear down?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.460
And all the crowds we'd see gather round?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.500
Who knew the life we would've found?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.720
Who knew?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.720
And if everyday you'd tell me I wouldn't believe
you,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.240
who knew?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.110
I remember railcars, and driving you to prom,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.560
So afraid I could barely speak, let alone
dance.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.530
We never had much money to spend,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.350
but that didn’t slow us down.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.689
Who knew?

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.979
I remember a girl with humble dreams, hoping
for the best.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.000
I was a boy with big intentions, the world on my chest

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.759
We never seemed to have much luck to spare,

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:05.700
It would take everywhere.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.369
Who knew we'd grow up and out of this town
and all the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.299
places we'd go now?

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.700
Who knew the troubles we'd overcome,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.170
Who knew?

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.800
Who knew the barriers we'd tear down?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.800
And all the crowds we'd see gather round?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.700
Who knew the life we would've found?

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.220
Who knew?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.730
And if everyday you'd tell me I wouldn't believe
you.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.629
Who knew?

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.470
We were just kids in love just wanting to
fly,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.440
we never imagined it would take us this high.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.599
Taking chances well that was just our way,

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.549
And I find myself asking everyday

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.590
Who knew we'd grow up and out of this town

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.590
and all the places that we'd go now?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.700
Who knew the troubles we'd overcome?

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.720
Who knew?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.260
Who knew the barriers we'd tear down?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.750
And all the crowds we'd see gather round?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.890
Who knew the life we would've found?

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.430
Who knew?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.430
And if everyday you'd tell me I wouldn't believe
you.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.120
Oh, if everyday you’d tell me I wouldn’t
believe you.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.070
Who knew?
