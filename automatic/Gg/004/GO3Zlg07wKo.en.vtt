 Such as a wedding song to Well image of a marriage-type and serves as the wedding from this that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.559
 I understand that it is a song that says so 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.559
 then 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.339
 It is a song iterator of Hey vocal of the main vocal

 There is a calm atmosphere 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:21.550
 Carefully and repeat it over and over again 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.520
 The feeling to say that I say so continue is expressed 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.659

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.460
 Hmm 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.230
 I think there is a powerful 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.250
 So many people 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.000
 Well hey say that the chorus is a simple 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.120
 It offers powerful 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.310
 Come on, it's at the same time 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:10.050
 It is a chorus part that is not usually conscious 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.160
 This is the part of the chorus that I usually listen to and don't notice. 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.290
 A large number of people are good 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 Being involved 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.730
 Be aware that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.319
 Yeah it is not the Hatton 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:30.090
 Because it means that just this alone people caught on screen 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.090
 Behind that there are more people 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.280
 And the last part of the song 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.350
 That's fine- 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.010
 The song is over 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.819
 Well, only the song is quietly flowing core metal best 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.819
 I hope parentheses 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:59.069
 I of Japanese banks 2 chorus 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:03.650
 I'm closing my mouth and standing twistingly I wait for the song to finish in the pants 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:07.720
 Well, I guess this is not part of the chorus here 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.720
 It means that you should not make sound but 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.620
 Here we dare close to 25 seconds 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.000
 It sounds like a silent sound chorus 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.630
 No 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.790
 It is great- 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.780
 that 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.850
 It is if the song is not a wedding song 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 Likely 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.350
 Well, like celebrating the beginning of two people getting married 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:40.860
 Such as pray for the well sleep happy 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:45.530
 I think that it is so say Hey scene, such as watch is em Gonko Nejitto 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.980

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.930
 No 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.930
 It was good 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:07.420

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.380

 By the time you get to a money horse that can make one song 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.780
 When the sound say this modest work is at last 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.340

 Possible even in this pv but possible 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.830
 It is continuity yeah 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.480
 This main vocal is 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.470

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.630
 Marriage life too 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.390
 Continuity is 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.820
 When you need it 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.490
 And hey how many people in the chorus 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.330
