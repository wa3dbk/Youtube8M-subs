00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
Mac you will not be able to custom

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.149 
Mac you will not be able to custom
configure<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> buttons<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:10.049> even<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:10.920> some

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
configure the buttons or even use some

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.230 
configure the buttons or even use some
of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> buttons<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> I'll<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.939> over<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.180> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
of the buttons and I'll go over that in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
of the buttons and I'll go over that in
a<00:01:12.360> second<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.900> bottom<00:01:13.590> line<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a second so bottom line is if you're a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
a second so bottom line is if you're a
Mac<00:01:14.729> user<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:15.509> probably<00:01:15.840> avoid<00:01:16.140> these

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Mac user i would probably avoid these

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.969 
Mac user i would probably avoid these
and<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:17.000> keep<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.509> pc<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.320> let's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and just go keep them for pc so let's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.190 
and just go keep them for pc so let's
start<00:01:20.189> off<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> wired<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.049> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
start off with the wired one which is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
start off with the wired one which is
right<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.409> obviously<00:01:23.100> you're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.460> to

allows you to set three different DPI

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.630 
allows you to set three different DPI
levels<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> wireless<00:01:44.070> one

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
levels this one is for the wireless one

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
levels this one is for the wireless one
if<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.939> bring<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> packaging<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
if I bring the packaging in for the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.980 
if I bring the packaging in for the
wired<00:01:46.490> over<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:47.970> three<00:01:48.299> DPI

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
wired over here there are three DPI

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.609 
wired over here there are three DPI
levels<00:01:49.640> 800<00:01:50.640> 1200<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.390> 1600s<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> can

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
levels 800 1200 and 1600s so you can

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.850 
levels 800 1200 and 1600s so you can
essentially<00:01:53.570> change<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> DPI<00:01:55.020> level<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
essentially change the DPI level or the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
essentially change the DPI level or the
sensitivity<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> mouse<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> fly<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
sensitivity of the mouse on the fly so

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.719 
sensitivity of the mouse on the fly so
if<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.170> doing<00:01:58.380> gaming<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> have

if you're doing gaming you want to have

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
if you're doing gaming you want to have
it<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.060> level<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.540> click<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> button<00:02:01.140> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it at one level you click the button for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
it at one level you click the button for
doing<00:02:01.799> something<00:02:02.009> else<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.460> want<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
doing something else you want to have it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
doing something else you want to have it
at<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> different<00:02:03.270> level<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.659> hit<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.899> again<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
at a different level you hit it again it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.609 
at a different level you hit it again it
has<00:02:04.770> some<00:02:04.979> nice<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:06.049> tactile<00:02:07.049> material

holding it and it tracks feel nice when
you're<00:02:12.940> using<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.330> did<00:02:13.480> hook<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.750> up<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.870> my

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
you're using it I did hook it up to my

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.300 
you're using it I did hook it up to my
mac<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.440> again<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.710> can<00:02:14.830> use<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.100> with<00:02:15.250> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
mac and again you can use this with a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.220 
mac and again you can use this with a
mac<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.330> only<00:02:16.420> buttons<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.870> could<00:02:17.080> get<00:02:17.200> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
mac so the only buttons I could get to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.540 
mac so the only buttons I could get to
work<00:02:17.470> with<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.800> are<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> right<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.520> left

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
batteries go in here and what's cool

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.290 
batteries go in here and what's cool
about<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.650> not<00:03:02.709> rechargeable<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
about it it's not rechargeable but the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.210 
about it it's not rechargeable but the
batteries<00:03:04.900> are<00:03:05.080> optimized<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.830> has<00:03:05.950> power

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
batteries are optimized it has power

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
saving functionality into it which will

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.550 
saving functionality into it which will

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
make the batteries last for 18 months so

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.140 
make the batteries last for 18 months so
that's<00:03:11.680> pretty<00:03:11.980> ridiculous<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.700> get<00:03:12.820> over<00:03:13.060> a
