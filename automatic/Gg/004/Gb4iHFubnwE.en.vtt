00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.460
 I love you so much here 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.550
 an eclipse, however, no 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 normal in the sense but here have 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.040
 we have the eclipse 1 custom in the ft as well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.680
 fitness variant speak like one here 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.180
 looks from the wide forth full corpus 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.050
 So deep is meant here, of course 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.620
 as in real ones so in an original 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.690
 les paul because that's generally had times 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.040
 in short, just a halt 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.220
 often that the eclipse of the pure 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.739
 corpus before I say time of the model 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.479
 Of esp often with the gibson les paul 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.460
 or similar models 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.020
 that is then of the form and partly 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.550
 from the point of view of the sound 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.619
 but not really that is possible 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.200
 really rather because of the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.649
 Body otherwise at digital halt so thin 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.050
 is 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.250
 yes, I'll say that with your own 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.500
 sound from andreas poll not much to do 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.800
 therefore has really cool at this point 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.990
 that this special model is limited here 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.459
 was thrown on the market because so 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.319
 I have to say I like everyone 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.899
 event really well and we are watching the 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.610
 Best guitar from top to bottom 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.340
 every now and then from head to toe 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.759
 foot and although we have up here first 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.590
 motto local tuner installs the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.149
 complete hps here in gold so well 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.380
 also with the white beining theirs 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.690
 of course, you can see that on black 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.209
 From the end, everything goes in the direction of the bold 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.350
 kastl in black beauty but they like it 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.490
 really cool in any case 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.340
 otherwise we have 22 frets on our 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 ebony fingerboard really but 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.990
 you never have to be really cool 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.179
 the flec inlays from esp just like you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.580
 knows here in front again otherwise 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.700
 leaves paul ingredients on course 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.090
 speak rosewood ebony fingerboard 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.800
 i said margoni as a mahogany 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.750
 corpus and you can see it here, of course 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.220
 not a nice but now and blanket 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.830
 actually cleaned up again where the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.830
 Of course, over painted otherwise leaves 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.709
 electronic speak three ways bird 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.090
 twice volume 2 x ton at the parties 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.280
 and 60 and 80 we have here too 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.870
 so obstruct the 81 below the 60 above 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.349
 on the neck I would say 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.670
 the eclipse only now off small and 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.620
 if you, of course ma scheinlich 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.069
 pc area should be more interesting to us 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.510
 he collapsed here under pressure 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.370
 I've got it now, you multiply it 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 namely already equal time all 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.819
 turned back 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.250
 logically with his body lower in such 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.810
 of course, that's a lot of weather 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.940
 you have to do that wonderfully, too 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.680
 So the best piece of hands then far 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.450
 depending on and natural with it there as well 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.470
 not so good and beautiful transparent 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.470
 stays as it would like 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.730
 So I'll tell you where in your jazz yes 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.640
 is often said to have I to tell 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.000
 may sound sterile anyway 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.370
 Everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.500
 Finally, know and decide 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.760
 I have to say that guitar with the pick 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 ups at this end right now 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.870
 I really like it and mine 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.480
 opinion can not determine that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.310
 that is just very dynamic 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.319
 sound so clear at almost pick 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.940
 ups was a little bit more go though 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.230
 for digital I say beats her 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.150
 to klien but already really really good 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.129
 So I like it very much 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.140
 I would say we hear the clips 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.549
 now just here in the second channel 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.650
 say eat on the jerk on give me 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.940
 a little more on it and then steam 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.530
 you also notice directly I say that 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.539
 what you think of the guitar 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.850
 expected well fulfilled now 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.660
 speaks super super fed push pushes 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.660
 without end 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.330
 so the imsi pickups may be 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.470
 especially here on this guitar 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.670
 useful because the better stop at the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.600
 well-known 80 usually rise a bit 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.950
 I'll say I'll be cut 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.270
 and perhaps that compensates 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.950
 also in the own area this 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.140
 moment that the guitar just like that 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030
 swine dick is yes because that can grad 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.860
 I think if you play the guitar now 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.950
 even deeper is true so deep 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.030
 direction what do I know there and deeper that 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.160
 it is really very queasy it 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.260
 but you have to go here 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.540
 accordingly when the electronics 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.560
 no worries were made 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.370
 very well defined everything we hear us 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.370
 Now again the neck 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.410
 b 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.750
 the esp clips 1 box fitness my 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.400
 in any case according to the outside 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.200
 lets paul killer so this job is 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.750
 it's also really appropriate then 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.660
 of course for the harder area for 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.370
 designed the slightly harder gangue 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.570
 pig horny rock and metal guitar 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.220
 feels great 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.460
 Great that they play like 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.140
 butter sounds good comes over where they are 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.420
 productive here in ibbenbÃ¼ren and 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.420
 plays her best himself to the measure
