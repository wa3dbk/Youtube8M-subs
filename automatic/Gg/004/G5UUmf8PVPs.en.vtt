consuming<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.040> product<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.640> seems<00:02:32.420> harmless

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
consuming a product that seems harmless

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.840 
consuming a product that seems harmless
or<00:02:33.110> relatively<00:02:33.500> harmless<00:02:33.800> each<00:02:34.520> one

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
or relatively harmless each one

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.010 
or relatively harmless each one
individually<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.730> missing<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.360> one<00:02:38.780> key

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
individually but it is missing a one key

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.500 
individually but it is missing a one key
element<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.709> truly<00:02:40.959> toxic<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:43.160> missing<00:02:43.760> this

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
element a truly toxic is missing this

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.380 
element a truly toxic is missing this
one<00:02:44.810> key<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.320> it's<00:02:45.650> commonly<00:02:46.070> found<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
one key and it's commonly found in the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.820 
one key and it's commonly found in the
human<00:02:47.540> body<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:49.180> hydrogen

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
human body and that is hydrogen

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.130 
human body and that is hydrogen
see<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.670> two<00:02:52.820> chemicals<00:02:53.030> by<00:02:53.420> themselves<00:02:53.870> are

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
see the two chemicals by themselves are

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.170 
see the two chemicals by themselves are
fine<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.740> when<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.280> know<00:02:55.310> about<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.820> human

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
fine but when you you know about a human

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.760 
fine but when you you know about a human
bodies<00:02:56.540> nineteen<00:02:56.900> ninety-eight<00:02:57.500> percent

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
bodies nineteen ninety-eight percent

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.990 
bodies nineteen ninety-eight percent
water<00:02:58.330> chemical<00:02:59.330> equation<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.840> course<00:03:00.050> is<00:03:00.260> h2o

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
water chemical equation of course is h2o

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.640 
water chemical equation of course is h2o
so<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:02.210> stealing<00:03:02.480> hydrogen<00:03:03.200> or<00:03:03.380> body

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
so it's stealing hydrogen or body

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.040 
so it's stealing hydrogen or body

moisture in order to create these

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.590 
moisture in order to create these
chemicals<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.740> does<00:03:06.890> create<00:03:07.450> inside<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600

container possibly could if you spill
water<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.670> there<00:03:10.850> but<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.210> wouldn't

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
water in there but you wouldn't

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.820

might find in baby formula it creates a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.850 
might find in baby formula it creates a
tile<00:04:28.160> like<00:04:28.900> planar<00:04:29.900> structure<00:04:30.320> literally

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
tile like planar structure literally

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.190 
tile like planar structure literally
these<00:04:31.460> these<00:04:31.910> structures<00:04:32.570> start<00:04:32.840> building

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
these these structures start building

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.999 
these these structures start building
themselves<00:04:33.350> over<00:04:33.830> top<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.040> one<00:04:34.280> another

themselves over top of one another

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.480 
themselves over top of one another
and<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:36.360> that's<00:04:37.349> your<00:04:37.559> kidney<00:04:37.860> failure<00:04:38.129> renal

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
and so that's your kidney failure renal

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.700 
and so that's your kidney failure renal
failure<00:04:38.849> your<00:04:39.419> blood<00:04:39.659> problems<00:04:40.110> now<00:04:40.589> they

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
failure your blood problems now they

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.320 
failure your blood problems now they
found<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.009> same<00:04:41.189> problem<00:04:41.580> back<00:04:41.729> in<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:41.939> 90s

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
found the same problem back in the 90s

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.850 
found the same problem back in the 90s
they<00:04:42.509> were<00:04:42.629> trying<00:04:42.779> to<00:04:42.900> do<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.169> to<00:04:43.259> cattle<00:04:43.619> and

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
they were trying to do it to cattle and

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.760 
they were trying to do it to cattle and
I<00:04:43.889> was<00:04:44.009> killing<00:04:44.249> cattle<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.379> it's<00:04:46.379> not<00:04:46.589> good

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
I was killing cattle and it's not good

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.260 
I was killing cattle and it's not good
enough<00:04:46.800> for<00:04:47.129> cattle<00:04:47.399> any<00:04:47.550> more<00:04:47.759> weeks<00:04:48.029> sure

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
enough for cattle any more weeks sure

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.299 
enough for cattle any more weeks sure
feed<00:04:48.509> it<00:04:48.629> to<00:04:48.749> humans<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.860> know<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:49.979> can<00:04:50.159> throw<00:04:50.279> a

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:50.309 
feed it to humans you know I can throw a

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:51.709 
feed it to humans you know I can throw a
lot<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.580> stuff<00:04:50.759> at<00:04:50.939> you<00:04:51.089> as<00:04:51.180> far<00:04:51.389> as<00:04:51.509> this<00:04:51.629> goes

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
lot of stuff at you as far as this goes

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.839 
lot of stuff at you as far as this goes
and<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.710> chemical<00:04:53.069> equation<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:53.669> how<00:04:53.759> it

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
and the chemical equation for how it

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.850 
and the chemical equation for how it
works<00:04:53.999> out<00:04:54.180> but<00:04:54.330> we'd<00:04:54.479> all<00:04:54.599> be<00:04:54.749> confused<00:04:55.229> I'm

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
works out but we'd all be confused I'm

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.200 
works out but we'd all be confused I'm
not<00:04:56.039> totally<00:04:56.219> confused<00:04:56.729> at<00:04:56.849> took<00:04:56.999> a<00:04:57.089> little

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
not totally confused at took a little

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.159 
not totally confused at took a little
chemistry<00:04:57.569> so<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.020> not<00:04:58.319> completely<00:04:58.830> lost<00:05:00.169> now

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
chemistry so I'm not completely lost now

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.239 
chemistry so I'm not completely lost now
the<00:05:01.229> real<00:05:01.649> the<00:05:02.430> real<00:05:02.460> toxic<00:05:03.800> problem<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:05.009> the

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:05.249 
the real the real toxic problem is the

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.179 
the real the real toxic problem is the
site<00:05:05.490> cyanuric<00:05:06.210> acid<00:05:06.889> combined<00:05:07.889> with<00:05:08.009> its

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
spoke like crystals cause sudden kidney

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.850

now<00:05:13.860> here's<00:05:14.309> the<00:05:14.460> one<00:05:14.610> thing<00:05:14.849> that<00:05:14.879> they<00:05:15.089> don't

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
now here's the one thing that they don't

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.639 
now here's the one thing that they don't
tell<00:05:15.449> you<00:05:15.569> about<00:05:15.779> of<00:05:15.990> course<00:05:16.139> when<00:05:16.259> you<00:05:16.469> go<00:05:16.589> to

there to stir it up and it's rather
tasty<00:05:23.149> kids<00:05:24.149> seem<00:05:24.389> to<00:05:24.509> like<00:05:24.659> it<00:05:24.719> they<00:05:24.960> don't

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
tasty kids seem to like it they don't

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.189 
tasty kids seem to like it they don't
even<00:05:25.319> know<00:05:25.439> what<00:05:25.620> we're<00:05:25.770> giving<00:05:26.069> to<00:05:26.219> them<00:05:26.399> now

would get inside the lungs of your enemy

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.860 
would get inside the lungs of your enemy
and<00:05:56.350> literally<00:05:57.310> boil<00:05:57.699> off<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.210> lungs<00:05:58.479> on<00:05:58.780> the

and literally boil off the lungs on the

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.110 
and literally boil off the lungs on the
inside<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.949> blood<00:06:00.160> would<00:06:00.310> fill<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.699> lungs<00:06:00.850> in

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
inside the blood would fill the lungs in

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.790 
inside the blood would fill the lungs in
the<00:06:01.210> person<00:06:01.540> would<00:06:01.720> drown<00:06:01.930> to<00:06:02.199> death<00:06:02.229> in<00:06:02.680> their

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
they do it melamine actually when it's

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.200 
they do it melamine actually when it's
sent<00:06:09.550> into<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.820> Food<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.180> Drug
