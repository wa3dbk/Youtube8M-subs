 of daily makeup so to speak already 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.410

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.420
 that I do the order that applied the things and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.950
 all of that I also want to tell you that if 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.539

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.369

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.500
 hesitate to tell me they can leave me here 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.880
 in the comments and well no longer 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.650
 I talk so much because I do not want it to be 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 so long this video I do not want that 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.960
 be like half an hour and I leave you with the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.820
 video as I told you is my routine 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.820
 makeup and the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.850
 apply is this mamanis water and or 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.399
 sprayed for all of us and good after 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.980
 that was absorbed I will apply my 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.559
 This moisturizer has 30 of 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:55.199
 sunscreen and is the unit of 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:55.199
 infusion to apply in dots 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.500
 you do not occupy much with this one because as it is 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.450
 excluded I take a little bit of you already 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 you cover the whole face as you can see 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.410
 also the advance a little bit my eyebrows 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.560
 to make this video more agile because it 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.920
 absorbed I'm going to apply this first of 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.530
 citi color 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.140
 this was going to apply like this first of 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.390
 it's really super super good after I go 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.970
 to apply my base and this is the glory 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.580
 of the true match in the double tournament or 4.5 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.580
 which is the one of the warm tones 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.149
 ah 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.609
 and then I'll apply taps with this 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.609
 brochette 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.120
 after applying a little bit of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280
 corrector and I'm going to use this one of the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.960
 mark notice that I love is the environment 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.160
 11 with this kind of synthetic quotes 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.560
 they cover super super well so no 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.700
 we use like so much I'm going to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.099
 combine it with this type of spit 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.519
 and that I was forgetting I'm going to treat the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.019
 lips and I'm going to use car mex 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.319
 although already after that small 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.690
 This forgetting reminder I will seal 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.580
 this already the base and the corrector that 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.650
 Apply and I'll do it with this powder 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.420
 of rose in the middle environment you see that the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.910
 I really loved this kind of 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.120
 brush is almost similar with the capital 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.220
 base only that this is my he gives it and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.560
 now I'm going to apply contour and I 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.989
 like to eat it like that ingested and it seems 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.690
 use santÃ© powder that I love 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.860
 the money to introduced the xxxiii power 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.290
 that is in the tone number 6 and I what 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.049
 I apply with this pointed prose writer that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.640
 helps to mark that area well 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:58.040
 frame towards and with the same but with that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.090
 type of flat precision skewers I'll 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.019
 to apply here on the nose and I'll 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.269
 blur with the prose of photos I'm going 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.180
 to move to robotic apply this saying 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.510
 color the bigmat returns frames 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.510
 best 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.659
 and I'm going to apply it with this kind of 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:21.359
 Brushes as an illuminator I will use 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:25.950
 the mega glow of william white in the tone 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.480
 pink catwalk that is the 345 cd and it's going to 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.819
 apply with this small project 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.409
 bevel not hold so much product and be 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.460
 like that little bit and only so that 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.890
 It gives me a little glow in this area 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.900
 to know well in camera but without angle 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.390
 superbonito and now let's move on to the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.120
 eyes and I'm going to apply a little bit of the first 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.470
 finger 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.120
 come on man transition I like 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.240
 use of the product you use 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.920
 previously in the clearest part and 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.140
 now from the labour two of bourband and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.920
 keith I'm going to use shadow that's called 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.140
 night by that is like a brown shadow if 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.880
 it's dark with a little bit of simat and the 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.650
 applies on all the mobile eyelid and to 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.440
 do a little more depth I'm going to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.780
 use the vissum chocolate that is 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.790
 a super nice dark coffee and with the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.810
 project to blur this palette I'm going 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.570
 to apply it with shadows and why not 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.630
 I wished you reflection the mirror is this the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.070
 more clarita now I'm going to delineate my 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.960
 eyes and I'm going to do it with the high 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.050
 precision of go by 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.030
 with the same chocolate shade and with this 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.639
 brochita as pencil to apply it in 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.990
 the line of the lower lashes 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.509
 my eyelashes also collide and I'm going to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.810
 do with this brand trainer 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.300
 clean color and before applying mascara I'll 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.240
 to apply this delineator of scalpels 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.979
 waterproof eyeliner apply on the line 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.930
 upper part of the eyelashes so that 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.910
 see that they are fuller and can not be seen 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.250
 these bones as skin color between 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.440
 they are seen that several girls do 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.060
 just eyeliner like that and they have it 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.810

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.789
 that the wild and get up like this and 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.530
 delineate me because if I can not I can not say 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.240
 that looks horrible but that's how I 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.789
 I have accommodated then to go up to combine 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.250

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.250
