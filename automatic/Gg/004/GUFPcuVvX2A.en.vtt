00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
anywhere near an artist ended up

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.470 
anywhere near an artist ended up
scratching<00:00:10.410> some<00:00:11.190> dots<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.969> lines<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.330> I

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
scratching some dots and lines that I

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.900 
scratching some dots and lines that I
thought<00:00:12.690> were<00:00:12.870> pretty<00:00:13.139> cool<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.309> ended<00:00:14.820> up

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
thought were pretty cool I ended up

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.720 
thought were pretty cool I ended up
printing<00:00:15.179> them<00:00:15.389> out<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.750> putting<00:00:16.410> them<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
printing them out in putting them on the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
printing them out in putting them on the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
upcoming house tour 2011 and the reason

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
upcoming house tour 2011 and the reason
why<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.130> were<00:00:23.250> digitized<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.480> because<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
why they were digitized is because I

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.599 
why they were digitized is because I
ended<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.590> scratching<00:00:25.859> them<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ended up scratching them out on the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
ended up scratching them out on the
boogie<00:00:26.820> board<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.470> thought<00:00:29.070> well<00:00:29.130> what

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
boogie board and so I thought well what

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.010 
boogie board and so I thought well what
if<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.510> created<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.650> shop<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.160> Etsy<00:00:32.809> where<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
if I created a shop on Etsy where I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.069 
if I created a shop on Etsy where I
would<00:00:34.530> basically<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.399> same<00:00:35.969> random<00:00:36.780> set

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
would basically do the same random set

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.810 
would basically do the same random set
of<00:00:37.110> dots<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.860> whines<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.960> squares<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.820> other

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
of dots and whines and squares and other

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.799 
of dots and whines and squares and other
geometric<00:00:42.390> shapes<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.440> would<00:00:44.040> use<00:00:44.700> pens<00:00:45.480> right

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
geometric shapes I would use pens right

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.979 
geometric shapes I would use pens right
now<00:00:45.899> I've<00:00:46.020> got<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.200> handful<00:00:46.590> felt-tip<00:00:47.160> markers

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
now I've got a handful felt-tip markers

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.069 
now I've got a handful felt-tip markers
but<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.500> may<00:00:49.980> end<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.430> using<00:00:50.940> other<00:00:51.480> types<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
but I may end up using other types of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
but I may end up using other types of
cardstock<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.620> markers<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.370> people<00:00:53.969> decide

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
cardstock and markers if people decide

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.319 
cardstock and markers if people decide
that<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:55.289> drawings<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.850> originals

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that these drawings these originals

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.619 
that these drawings these originals
would<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.770> worth<00:00:59.010> buying<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.420> even<00:01:00.480> know

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
would be worth buying I don't even know

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.700 
would be worth buying I don't even know
how<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> sell<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
how much I'm going to sell them for I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.910 
how much I'm going to sell them for I
don't<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.010> much<00:01:02.250> people<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:02.910> spend

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
don't know how much people would spend

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.490 
don't know how much people would spend
they<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.070> come<00:01:05.280> likely<00:01:05.970> unframed<00:01:06.540> I'm

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500

thinking in between fifteen and twenty

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
thinking in between fifteen and twenty
dollars<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.460> realized<00:01:11.760> oh<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.180> oh

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

that's crazy well you know takes time

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.859 
that's crazy well you know takes time

and I've purchased a lot of virginal art
from<00:01:35.729> etsy<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> variety<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.829> guess

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
from etsy for a variety of I guess

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.679 
from etsy for a variety of I guess
prices<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.900> largely<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.100> really

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
prices and largely because I was really

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.389 
prices and largely because I was really
happy<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.229> saw<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.250> buy

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
happy with what I saw don't just buy

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
happy with what I saw don't just buy
things<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> certainly

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
things that I don't like and I certainly

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
things that I don't like and I certainly
wouldn't<00:01:45.930> recommend<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.310> either<00:01:47.790> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
wouldn't recommend that to you either so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
wouldn't recommend that to you either so
here<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.320> drawing<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.700> first<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.860> guess<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
here I go drawing the first I guess of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.550 
here I go drawing the first I guess of
what<00:01:53.310> will<00:01:53.490> likely<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.540> series<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:57.560> original

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
what will likely be a series of original

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
what will likely be a series of original
pen<00:01:59.070> ink<00:02:00.049> drawings<00:02:01.049> from<00:02:01.320> me<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.759> don't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
pen ink drawings from me and I don't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.109 
pen ink drawings from me and I don't
know<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.770> any<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> them<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> be

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
know what any of them are going to be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.570 
know what any of them are going to be
until<00:02:06.780> after<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.799> them<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> mean<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.369> don't

until after I do them I mean I don't

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.770 
until after I do them I mean I don't
what<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.850> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> look<00:02:09.180> like<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.720> don't

existence<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.489> type<00:03:32.670> of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.910 
it partially upside down they don't give
me<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.800> slightly<00:03:59.220> different<00:03:59.430> perspective<00:04:00.920> but

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
me a slightly different perspective but

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
most of the things that I draw are

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.860 
most of the things that I draw are
probably<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.070> be<00:04:05.190> like<00:04:05.940> what<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.660> see

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
probably going to be like what you see

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.430 
probably going to be like what you see
here<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:09.150> thought<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.230> would<00:04:10.320> be

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
here and I thought it would be

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.039 
here and I thought it would be
interesting<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:11.720> record<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.040> first<00:04:14.330> penning

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
interesting to record the first penning

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.050 
interesting to record the first penning

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
getting there slowly but surely I don't

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
know where I'm going with this I in

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.080 
know where I'm going with this I in
terms<00:04:32.250> of<00:04:33.080> if<00:04:34.080> people<00:04:34.620> get<00:04:35.159> it<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.789> may<00:04:35.970> not

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
terms of if people get it you may not

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.600 
terms of if people get it you may not
get<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.569> don't<00:04:37.259> care<00:04:37.470> if<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:38.190> don't<00:04:38.310> get<00:04:38.520> it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
get it I don't care if you don't get it

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.740 
get it I don't care if you don't get it
because<00:04:38.729> ultimately<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:39.449> just<00:04:39.599> about

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
because ultimately it's just about

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.330 
because ultimately it's just about
giving<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.289> people<00:04:40.319> who<00:04:40.680> do<00:04:40.830> get<00:04:41.009> it<00:04:41.159> and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
giving it to people who do get it and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.170 
giving it to people who do get it and
then<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:43.229> sell<00:04:43.949> enough<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.490> them<00:04:44.669> then<00:04:45.000> I'll

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
then if I sell enough of them then I'll

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.610 
then if I sell enough of them then I'll
make<00:04:45.330> another<00:04:45.629> batch<00:04:45.870> I've<00:04:46.080> got<00:04:46.229> plenty<00:04:46.470> of

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
make another batch I've got plenty of

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.290 
make another batch I've got plenty of
card<00:04:46.889> stock<00:04:46.949> here<00:04:47.159> but<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.580> think<00:04:47.849> maybe<00:04:48.030> just

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
card stock here but I think maybe just

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.080 
card stock here but I think maybe just
putting<00:04:48.539> up<00:04:48.629> ten<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:49.289> begin<00:04:49.560> with<00:04:49.969> should<00:04:50.969> be

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
putting up ten to begin with should be

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.659 
putting up ten to begin with should be
enough<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.629> there<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.810> go<00:04:51.930> go<00:04:52.229> tag<00:04:52.650> jag<00:04:52.919> calm<00:04:53.370> /

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
enough so there you go go tag jag calm /

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.129 
enough so there you go go tag jag calm /
etsy<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:56.400> know<00:04:56.490> maybe<00:04:57.030> if<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.659> saw<00:04:57.870> enough

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
etsy and you know maybe if I saw enough

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.469 
etsy and you know maybe if I saw enough
of<00:04:58.229> them<00:04:58.349> i<00:04:58.530> can<00:04:58.740> live<00:04:59.310> stream<00:04:59.819> me<00:05:00.090> drawing

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
of them i can live stream me drawing

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.300 
of them i can live stream me drawing
them<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.050> then<00:05:01.289> you<00:05:01.379> can<00:05:01.500> make<00:05:01.620> bids<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:02.129> them

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
them and then you can make bids for them

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.209 
them and then you can make bids for them
as<00:05:02.520> i<00:05:02.849> as<00:05:03.060> i<00:05:03.240> complete<00:05:03.419> them<00:05:03.690> no<00:05:04.319> no<00:05:04.440> no<00:05:04.650> not
