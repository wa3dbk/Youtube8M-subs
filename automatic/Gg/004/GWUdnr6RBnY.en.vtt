the<00:00:11.690> hole<00:00:12.690> that's<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.259> handle<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:14.400> for

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the hole that's in the handle was for

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.820 
the hole that's in the handle was for
putting<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.750> sharpened<00:00:16.199> stick<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.680> using

the thing is marketed or that's the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.570 
the thing is marketed or that's the
information<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:26.760> being<00:00:27.119> passed<00:00:27.359> today

information that's being passed today

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.810 
information that's being passed today
but<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> made<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:29.939> important<00:00:30.359> discovery<00:00:31.820> went

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
but I made an important discovery went

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.110 
but I made an important discovery went
online<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.480> found<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.489> believe<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.969> an

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
online I found this I believe this is an

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.139 
online I found this I believe this is an
original<00:00:36.710> Austrian

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
original Austrian

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.319 
original Austrian

Feld Messer seventy-eight field knife

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.319 
Feld Messer seventy-eight field knife
it's<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> correct<00:00:42.899> color<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.700> you'll<00:00:44.969> notice

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it's the correct color and you'll notice

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
it's the correct color and you'll notice
that<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.969> logo<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.000> different<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.710> believe

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that the logo is different and I believe

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
that the logo is different and I believe
that<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> original<00:00:50.820> Glock<00:00:51.059> field<00:00:51.480> knife<00:00:51.750> was

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that the original Glock field knife was

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.970 
that the original Glock field knife was
designed<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> bayonet<00:00:54.649> for<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> Steyr

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
designed to be a bayonet for the Steyr

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000 
designed to be a bayonet for the Steyr
AUG<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.960> has<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> hole<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
AUG and that's why it has that hole in

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
AUG and that's why it has that hole in
the<00:00:59.129> bottom<00:01:01.460> that's<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> primary<00:01:02.940> purpose

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the bottom that's the primary purpose

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
the bottom that's the primary purpose
for<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.960> hole<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:07.430> same<00:01:08.430> thing<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
for that hole and same thing with the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.670 
for that hole and same thing with the
bottle<00:01:09.210> opener<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.689> mean<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> might<00:01:10.380> actually

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
bottle opener I mean that might actually

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
bottle opener I mean that might actually
function<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> bottle<00:01:12.000> opener<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> think

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
function as a bottle opener but I think

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.410 
function as a bottle opener but I think
the<00:01:16.200> original<00:01:16.650> purpose<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the original purpose for that was to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.880 
the original purpose for that was to
brace<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:18.990> against<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> flash<00:01:19.680> suppressor

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
brace it up against the flash suppressor

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:30.200 
brace it up against the flash suppressor
on<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.750> steyr<00:01:22.130> rifle<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
on the steyr rifle this one is in a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510 
on the steyr rifle this one is in a
little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.570> rough<00:01:30.689> shape<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> adds

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
little bit of rough shape but that adds

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.300 
little bit of rough shape but that adds
a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> character<00:01:33.860> they<00:01:34.860> aren't<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.100> much

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
a lot of character they aren't as much

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
a lot of character they aren't as much
fun<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:35.729> they're<00:01:35.880> brand<00:01:36.119> new<00:01:36.210> I've<00:01:36.600> got<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
fun when they're brand new I've got a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.950 
fun when they're brand new I've got a
brand<00:01:37.140> new<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.979> same<00:01:38.250> color<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
brand new one right here same color I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.270 
brand new one right here same color I
just<00:01:39.960> wanted<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.770> there's<00:01:41.040> any

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
just wanted to see if there's any

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.660 
just wanted to see if there's any
difference<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.460> green<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.030> these

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
difference in the in the green on these

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.649 
difference in the in the green on these
it<00:01:47.670> looks<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.259> almost<00:01:49.680> identical<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:51.479> one

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it looks to be almost identical this one

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.350 
it looks to be almost identical this one
is<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.840> cleaner<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:53.939> there's<00:01:54.149> some

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
is just cleaner you can see there's some

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.980 
is just cleaner you can see there's some
real<00:01:54.990> faint<00:01:56.299> marker<00:01:57.299> writing<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.810> here

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
real faint marker writing on here

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.550 
real faint marker writing on here
probably<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> guy<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.579> issued<00:01:59.759> to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
probably the guy that it was issued to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.990 
probably the guy that it was issued to
and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.040> sure<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and I don't know for sure that this is a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.440 
and I don't know for sure that this is a
glock<00:02:03.270> austrian<00:02:04.490> field<00:02:05.490> knife<00:02:05.729> eel<00:02:05.969> from<00:02:06.299> the

glock austrian field knife eel from the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.949 
glock austrian field knife eel from the
military<00:02:07.729> but<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.910> definitely<00:02:09.509> from<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
military but it's definitely from that

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:19.860 
military but it's definitely from that
era

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.420 

here's<00:02:20.870> what<00:02:21.079> a<00:02:21.109> few<00:02:22.750> decades<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:24.019> use<00:02:24.250> make<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
here's what a few decades of use make it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.240 
here's what a few decades of use make it
look<00:02:25.609> like<00:02:26.590> which<00:02:27.590> one<00:02:27.829> looks<00:02:28.010> better

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
look like which one looks better

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.640 
look like which one looks better
probably<00:02:28.969> the<00:02:29.030> one<00:02:29.150> that's<00:02:29.180> hammered<00:02:29.719> up<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
probably the one that's hammered up the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.910 
probably the one that's hammered up the
one<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> use<00:02:31.189> most<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.849> my<00:02:32.349> black<00:02:33.349> one<00:02:33.650> here

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
one that I use most is my black one here

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.789 
one that I use most is my black one here
this<00:02:34.069> one<00:02:34.129> is<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.700> throwing<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:36.409> keep<00:02:36.620> it

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
this one is for throwing and I keep it

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.369
