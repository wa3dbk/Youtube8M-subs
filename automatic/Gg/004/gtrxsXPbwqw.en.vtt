looking at leather wool silk um down for
your<00:00:38.610> products<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.920> entertainment

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
your products that you use entertainment

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
your products that you use entertainment
but<00:00:41.489> first<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> foremost<00:00:42.329> most<00:00:42.899> important<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
but first and foremost most important is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.810 
but first and foremost most important is
what<00:00:43.649> you're<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:43.950> eating<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.700> you're

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
what you're actually eating what you're

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
what you're actually eating what you're
putting<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.210> mouth<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.020> education<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
putting in your mouth so education is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.740 
putting in your mouth so education is
what<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.309> step<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.450> feel

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
what you want to do step one if you feel

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.720 
what you want to do step one if you feel
like<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> go<00:00:49.739> vegetarian<00:00:49.950> first

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
like you need to go vegetarian first

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
like you need to go vegetarian first
then<00:00:51.030> okay<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> stepping<00:00:52.350> stone<00:00:52.710> but

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
then okay use it as a stepping stone but

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
then okay use it as a stepping stone but
a<00:00:53.309> lot<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.670> people<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.840> straight

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a lot of people do actually go straight

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.860 
a lot of people do actually go straight
from<00:00:55.620> McGary<00:00:56.010> knees<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.699> vegan<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.510> step

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
from McGary knees to vegan in one step

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
from McGary knees to vegan in one step
so<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.340> ethical<00:00:59.760> reasons

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
so because if it is for ethical reasons

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
so because if it is for ethical reasons
in<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.559> against<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> killing<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
in that you are against the killing of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
in that you are against the killing of
animals<00:01:02.930> knowing<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.960> dairy<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> eggs

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
animals knowing that dairy and eggs

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.620 
animals knowing that dairy and eggs
cannot<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.519> produced<00:01:05.880> without<00:01:06.090> killing

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
cannot be produced without killing

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.690 
cannot be produced without killing
animals<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> sort<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
animals then you know that sort of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
animals then you know that sort of
defeats<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> purpose<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> difference

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
defeats the purpose and the difference

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.070 
defeats the purpose and the difference
is<00:01:10.439> often<00:01:10.770> education<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.750> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is often education so at the time we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
is often education so at the time we
didn't<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.799> dairy<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> eggs<00:01:14.909> couldn't

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
didn't know that dairy and eggs couldn't

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.929 
didn't know that dairy and eggs couldn't
be<00:01:15.450> produced<00:01:15.840> without<00:01:16.020> killing<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
be produced without killing and now we

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
be produced without killing and now we
know<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> obviously<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> health<00:01:19.770> aspect

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
know that obviously on the health aspect

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
know that obviously on the health aspect
if<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.119> wanting<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:22.110> away<00:01:22.229> from<00:01:22.409> me

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
if you're wanting to get away from me

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
if you're wanting to get away from me
for<00:01:23.159> health<00:01:23.369> reasons<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.450> start<00:01:24.689> looking

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
for health reasons got to start looking

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
for health reasons got to start looking
at<00:01:25.290> Daria's<00:01:25.740> liquid<00:01:26.310> meat<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
at Daria's liquid meat because it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.569 
at Daria's liquid meat because it
contains<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.110> artery-clogging

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
contains just as much artery-clogging

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
contains just as much artery-clogging
cholesterol<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.759> saturated<00:01:29.970> fat<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:31.380> does

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
cholesterol and saturated fat as me does

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
cholesterol and saturated fat as me does
and<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.700> eggs<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> highest

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and also eggs are the highest

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
and also eggs are the highest
cholesterol<00:01:33.689> forming<00:01:34.350> food<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.740> earth<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
cholesterol forming food on earth and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.789 
cholesterol forming food on earth and
cholesterol<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.689> scientifically<00:01:37.320> linked<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
cholesterol is scientifically linked to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
cholesterol is scientifically linked to
heart<00:01:38.040> disease<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.549> world's<00:01:38.820> leading<00:01:38.970> killer

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
heart disease the world's leading killer

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
heart disease the world's leading killer
exactly<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> doesn't<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:40.740> sense<00:01:40.920> does

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
exactly and it doesn't make sense does

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039 
exactly and it doesn't make sense does
it<00:01:41.280> no<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.360> environmental

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it no because it's for environmental

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.770 
it no because it's for environmental
reasons<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.729> production<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> dereon<00:01:45.630> ace

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
reasons the production of dereon ace

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.990 
reasons the production of dereon ace
still<00:01:46.290> involves<00:01:46.950> copious<00:01:47.490> amounts<00:01:47.880> of

still involves copious amounts of

still involves copious amounts of
greenhouse<00:01:48.240> gas<00:01:48.750> emissions<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.619> also<00:01:49.979> water

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
greenhouse gas emissions and also water

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.480 
greenhouse gas emissions and also water
