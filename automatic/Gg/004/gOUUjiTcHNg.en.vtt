00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.319
 what was hollywood of the 30s and a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.110
 trick very used in the movies in those 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.770

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.569
 that opens the shot to see these 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.160
 in the false sky the model returns to 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.540
 close and you have to put it blank and 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
 black there is believed at the beginning was 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.769

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.239
 take black and white until then 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.370

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.140
 deep street and the factors towards in 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.960

 constant changes and expansions have 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.169
 brought positive results for this 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.630
 park turning it into one of the most 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.150
