before<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.140> let<00:01:04.439> me<00:01:04.470> mention<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> all

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
before I do that let me mention that all

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.960 
before I do that let me mention that all
pads<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.270> lit<00:01:06.869> blue<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.740> times<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
pads are lit blue at all times so if the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
pads are lit blue at all times so if the
pads<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.479> illuminated<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.290> means<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.799> sample

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
pads are illuminated it means a sample

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
pads are illuminated it means a sample
is<00:01:11.369> playing<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.299> loop<00:01:12.510> something<00:01:12.840> they

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
is playing if you loop something they

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
is playing if you loop something they
will<00:01:13.470> stay<00:01:13.680> lit<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> sample<00:01:14.970> ends<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
will stay lit but when a sample ends the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
will stay lit but when a sample ends the
pad<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.170> go<00:01:16.290> back<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> dim<00:01:16.890> blue<00:01:17.130> instead<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
pad will go back to dim blue instead of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
pad will go back to dim blue instead of
bright<00:01:17.850> blue<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> let's<00:01:19.350> talk<00:01:19.710> about<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.130> rear

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
bright blue so let's talk about the rear

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.840 
bright blue so let's talk about the rear
