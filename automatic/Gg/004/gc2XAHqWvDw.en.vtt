00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.560 
there's a grip there's another version
you<00:00:50.280> could<00:00:50.460> another<00:00:50.850> way<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you could another way to use it as a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.069 
you could another way to use it as a
grip<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.730> then<00:00:53.730> here's<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> tripod

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
grip and then here's the tripod

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
grip and then here's the tripod
I<00:00:57.770> mean<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.920> identical<00:00:59.340> to<00:01:00.050> what<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.199> have

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
I mean it's identical to what they have

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.600 
I mean it's identical to what they have
and<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.180> far<00:01:03.320> I'm<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.379> happy<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and so far I'm very happy with it one of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
and so far I'm very happy with it one of
the<00:01:05.700> reasons<00:01:06.030> why<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.260> an

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the reasons why I like to use this as an

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.700 
the reasons why I like to use this as an
extension<00:01:07.890> arm<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> won't

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
extension arm is because you won't

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
extension arm is because you won't
actually<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:11.460> holding<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.689> those

monopods people use you actually you see
the<00:01:16.650> monopod<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.820> straight<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

me<00:02:17.310> looking<00:02:17.580> down<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:18.000> controlling<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
me looking down on controlling the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.380 
me looking down on controlling the
camera<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.530> app<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.240> could

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
camera with the app here so you could

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.540 
camera with the app here so you could
see<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.690> mirror<00:02:21.900> right<00:02:22.140> next<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.590> me<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:23.160> my

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
see in the mirror right next to me on my

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.060 
see in the mirror right next to me on my
right<00:02:24.050> how<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.080> had<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:26.120> monopod<00:02:27.230> twisted<00:02:28.230> so

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
right how I had this monopod twisted so

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.500 
right how I had this monopod twisted so
that<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> don't<00:02:29.490> see<00:02:29.700> me<00:02:29.850> holding<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that you don't see me holding it and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.270 
that you don't see me holding it and
that's<00:02:30.750> why<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.620> much<00:02:31.920> better

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that's why I like this so much better

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.730 
that's why I like this so much better
than<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.640> monocots<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.570> buy<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.590> are

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
than the monocots that you buy that are

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.580 
than the monocots that you buy that are
just<00:02:35.180> straight<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:37.260> you're<00:02:37.380> filming

just straight you when you're filming
yourself<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.670> see<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.970> monopod<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
yourself you see the monopod in the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.380 
yourself you see the monopod in the
video<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.860> actually<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.209> all

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
holding the monopod in the video where

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.080 
holding the monopod in the video where
it's<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:46.620> looks<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.090> someone's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it's with this it looks like someone's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.449 
it's with this it looks like someone's
videotaping<00:02:48.630> me<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> phone<00:02:50.280> app

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
videotaping me and with the phone app

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.670 
videotaping me and with the phone app
you'd<00:02:50.970> see<00:02:51.150> exactly<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:51.750> you're<00:02:51.870> doing<00:02:51.989> as

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you'd see exactly what you're doing as

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.229 
you'd see exactly what you're doing as
far<00:02:52.739> as<00:02:52.980> what's<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.519> picture<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:54.030> you

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
far as what's in the picture with you

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.820 
far as what's in the picture with you
these<00:02:54.870> GoPro<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.560> don't<00:02:55.709> need<00:02:55.769> a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
these GoPro is you don't need a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.680 
these GoPro is you don't need a
viewfinder<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:57.180> point<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
viewfinder you just point it in the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.130 
viewfinder you just point it in the
direction<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.200> want<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.470> film<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.980> it's<00:03:00.140> view

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
direction you want to film and it's view

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.800 
direction you want to film and it's view
is<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:02.130> wide<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.970> pick<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:03.450> everything

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
is so wide that you pick up everything

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.050 
is so wide that you pick up everything
and<00:03:06.200> like<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.320> said<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.769> know<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.670> price<00:03:08.820> I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
and like I said you know for the price I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.729 
and like I said you know for the price I
paid<00:03:09.300> for<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.050> can't<00:03:10.320> beat<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.709> price

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
paid for this you can't beat the price

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.550 
paid for this you can't beat the price
and<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:12.420> identical<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.440> GoPro

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
and it's identical to the one that GoPro

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.229 
and it's identical to the one that GoPro
sells<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.340> their<00:03:14.580> website

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
sells on their website

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.009 
sells on their website
I<00:03:15.800> guess<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> Chinese<00:03:17.310> clone<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:18.300> eBay<00:03:18.660> it

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
I guess the Chinese clone it on eBay it

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.050 
I guess the Chinese clone it on eBay it
came<00:03:19.230> from<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:20.100> was<00:03:20.190> shipped<00:03:20.459> actually<00:03:20.910> from

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
came from it was shipped actually from

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.390 
came from it was shipped actually from
California<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.410> guess<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:22.860> ship<00:03:23.160> their

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
California so I guess they ship their

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.940 
California so I guess they ship their
products<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.970> California<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.950> distribute

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
products to California they distribute

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.370 
products to California they distribute
it<00:03:26.070> out<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.519> here<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:27.810> happens<00:03:28.230> that's

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
it out to here and it so happens that's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.170 
it out to here and it so happens that's
where<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.620> GoPro<00:03:29.100> products<00:03:29.489> come<00:03:29.700> from<00:03:29.730> till

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
where the GoPro products come from till

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.720 
where the GoPro products come from till
so<00:03:30.780> doesn't<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:31.739> forward<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.550> it's

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
so doesn't have to go forward on it it's

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.960 
so doesn't have to go forward on it it's
$30<00:03:33.330> less<00:03:33.510> than<00:03:33.720> what's<00:03:33.870> online<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.790> has

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
$30 less than what's online and it has

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.490 
$30 less than what's online and it has
three<00:03:36.299> different<00:03:36.330> ways<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.989> could<00:03:37.080> use<00:03:37.140> this

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
three different ways you could use this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.280 
three different ways you could use this
and<00:03:37.799> my<00:03:38.610> favorite<00:03:39.030> way<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.180> filming<00:03:40.110> myself

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
and my favorite way is filming myself

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.740 
and my favorite way is filming myself
and<00:03:40.769> not<00:03:40.860> seeing<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.220> model<00:03:41.610> part<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.510> mono

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
and not seeing the model part the mono

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.320 
and not seeing the model part the mono
