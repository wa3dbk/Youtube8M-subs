00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.970
 and 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.260
 very good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.150
 apple video 5 x 1 on this occasion os 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.490
 let's bring something different we're going to 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.140
 bring as fast charge your 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.880
 your iphone we have all had that 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.830
 crisis moment at work out there 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.990
 we've been outside where we've seen 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.199
 that the good phone because it had little 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.340
 little battery that one of the 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.789
 main questions we have 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.260
 It is usually how to charge it fast 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.519
 I always have the doubt of where 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.800
 Load faster on a computer 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.940
 using a usb cable or directly on 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.870
 a rosette of light 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.410
 Well, I'm going to read the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.610
 cable specifications usb 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.520
 usb cable adapter voucher is 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.480
 basically let's see are 5 volts 05 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.210
 amps and 225 watts of power the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.879
 Power adapter are 5 volts a 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.739
 amp and 5 watts of power as 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.840
 you will see the charge power is 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.910
 quite higher in the loaders 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 directly on the wall is to say if you have 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.020
 you doubt and you have the possibility of being able 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.090
 connect your iphone directly to 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.289
 the wall do not doubt it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.109
 computer on one side and plug 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.539
 directly to the wall outlet because 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.490
 will load the 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.200
 next advice is about the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.509
 iphone temperature as it is when 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 load better the iphone we load better 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.829
 When the room temperature is more 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.509
 low therefore the first thing you have 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.759
 what to do is make sure that your 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.709
 phone has a correct temperature 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.450
 there are usually many people who carry the 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.280
 iphone me among them charge iphone 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.689
 directly with the cover if you run 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.030
 Hurry and you need the cargo to be what 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.459
 best possible, you should remove the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.920
 I found the phone because because the case 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.679
 makes the phone warm up so 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.149
 both the load capacity or the 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.979
 load optimization is not so 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.110
 accurate that is not so optimal forgiveness 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.899
 then remember the first advice 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.369
 plug one in for the second council 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.590
 remove the case so the phone 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.099
 transpire between quotation marks and release the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.129
 hot 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.619
 so I can load much better another advice 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:09.160
 better or better the third best advice 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.629
 said is to put the phone in airplane mode 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.310
 what do you do with this when you put the 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.989
 airplane mode what you are doing is that 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.750
 the phone is not at the same time that you are 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.640
 loading spending by spending resources on 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.390
 wifi network network connectivity 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.400
 bluetooth plus put the airplane mode it 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.620
 registered type of connections then the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.290
 phone is going to focus basically on 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.940
 load worth that would be the third council 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.250
 let's go over the first tips 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
 rosetta second advice remove the case 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.870
 of the phone so it does not get hot anymore 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 of the account and is more optimal the load and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.730
 third council put the phone in mode 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.250
 plane is worth fine we have had many 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.220
 questions about whether you can use the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.160
 ipad charger on our phone in 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.160
 our iphone we will see the optimal 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.050
 optimal is to have for each device its 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.940
 charger product not but in a moment 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.370
 given you can use the ipad chargers 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.220
 for your devices for your 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.840
 iphone you have iphone 6 and iphone 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.430
 6 plus luxury you will notice that the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.940
 phone charges much better much more 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.830
 fast is an optimal load 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.370
 those who have older devices 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.930
 iphone 55 s what happens 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.880
 obviously the phone the charger 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.800
 of the ipad gives quite more power is 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.050
 much more powerful but that does the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.600
 phone the phone itself reduces 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.670
 that power is say let's say not 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.590
 phone burns the phone only 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.480
 Accepts the load that you need ie 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.190
 you can charge your 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.460
 your devices with the charger 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.140
 of the ipad so that you have all the 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.270
 perfectly clear ideas of agreements 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.950
 let's leave it down here on the link in 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.420
 the description a link to a video in 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.850
 the one that explains all this with much more 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.490
 detail with much more detail forgiveness and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.740
 do not have any doubt so nothing 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.350
 guys up here this video with 3 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.990
 counsel if any doubt resolved in the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.640
 today and nothing else you know I hope 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.510
 see you in a next video because this is 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.920
 the 5 x 1 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.920
