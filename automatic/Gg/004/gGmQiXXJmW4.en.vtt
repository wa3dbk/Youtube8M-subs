00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Good afternoon, Rio Thunder 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.720
 financial advisor and in this video we 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.830
 talk about inflation what it is on 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.400
 in fact, money has a property 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.559
 to become cheaper 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.120
 if we do not use them as they are 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.910
 multiply then they lose weight 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.930
 and now we just see how it is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.449
 really happens in 1000 since 2000 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.730
 for the year 2009 the money has depreciated three 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 times as it happened we see that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 certain years have been certain 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.349
 inflation and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.019
 for example if we in a personal year could 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.630
 buy at 1000 rubles 10 kilogram 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 sausage then 2009 early ninth 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.550
 years but we can and the same thing is thousands 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 rubles to buy 3 kilogram bedrooms 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.879
 sausage that is money 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 ensured depreciated three times their 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.620
 buy on the ability of several 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.059
 decreased at the same time in Soviet times 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 there was no inflation there if 660 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.570
 year if we would put 100 rubles under 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 mattress then in 10 years we would get those 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.649
 the same 100 rubles from this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.359
 there is a need just the same 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.729
 invest money sv multiply 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.510
 lest they come on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.890
 depreciated 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.390
 that is, as it was before 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.369
 Soviet times often fail 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.020
 just who money under the mattress hope 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.479
 on the fact that it is not somehow preserved miraculous 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 way to date, ruble inflation 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.000
 is about ten to twelve 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.530
 percent year and sometimes even more 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 inflation of currencies like a dollar and a half 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.390
 2 percent inflation pounds 2 worthy 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.270
 percent in euro inflation is about three 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.909
 percent and last year really 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.299
 showed that investing money in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.150
 dollars for example or in euro more profitable 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.520
 than rubles that is ruble for last 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.520
 year by the floor price of 25 percent by 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 against leading currencies depreciated 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.610
 inflation was pretty strong then 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.770
 there is if we would even put a year ago 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.780
 money is five percent currency it was 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 would be much more advantageous than if 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 put money at 10 percent in rubles 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.229
