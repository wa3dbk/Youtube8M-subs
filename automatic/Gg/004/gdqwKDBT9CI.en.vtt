00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.629
 the space 

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:06.130
 Everyone is kind Fraxers are only infinite or know English 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.200
 would formulate Infinite Space hang in the English original 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.430
 a light on one of four so the last limit but in felt catfish is called 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.460
 now the new Star Trek title 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.970
 from the "Free to Play" specialist Gäng fort and the German developer team 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 succeed 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.469
 thanks to the slim unit TIU Butler he plagues in under small club 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.429
 StarCraft infinitas Basin Browser can be installed on almost anyone 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.839
 Calculator configuration we play the role of one 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.649
 Captain either on the part of the human-formed federation or 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.629
 the warlike Hiltenfingen live in time plays Infinite Space in parallel 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.150
 to mid-season blankets Space Nine TV series 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.900
 by the Federation every now and then in military conflicts 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.170
 entangled is the ideal time to prove yourself as a Kathan of a spaceship 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.260
 their apprenticeship begins in the Lauenstein space station of the chosen 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.980
 fraction 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.050
 So in this case the filler ration 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.130
 Here we can not only make contacts with other players but 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.610
 also for and from our club on old as well as for a substantial 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.770
 we do not want to get out of our hats 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.270
 community service 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 because an official officer uniform is better here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.240
 But the launch does not just want to make him a social meeting place and administration 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.780
 but also form the decisive points for the next mission 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.540
 Here, then, if we were, for example, the paper mission if 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.230
 to make an exploration or contest a combat mission 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.120
 while storey orders continue to play the storyline and also free us 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.329
 provide different solutions 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.329
 the IndyCars scenarios cheerfully let off steam in Siberia and wishes 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.530
 Decision tree battles 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.260
 In doing so, each mission can also operationally wants up to four more 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.600
 Teammates deny the right of brisk slaughter cattle to care for them 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.850
 The game mechanics in the fight reminds a bit of the old stalker 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.619
 Tamara title because here too the action only found battles in 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.810
 two dimensions instead 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.099
 in addition to the usual weapons like FaceTime and Photo &amp; Hobby going on 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.730
 as well as the shields for protection 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.249
 The special skills in the fight are especially important 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.440
 so we can learn enemy ships Keith the NPD 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.730
 Lay out mines 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.749
 Even friends turrets plant or distribute 360 ​​° shockwaves 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.499
 In addition, her escaping enemies by tractor jumped into combat 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.169
 withdraw 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.930
 The ship models are modeled exactly on the actual models 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.550
 Both the developers themselves and the licensor Seda watch over this 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.139
 firmly 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.900
 in favor of the playability one must take however a few compromises in purchase 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.280
 so the proportions are not always 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.959
 otherwise there are no shuttles as tiny dots in the infinite wide 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.290
 would disappear
