adds 0 bulk to the actual phone all it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.850 
adds 0 bulk to the actual phone all it
does<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:08.040> create<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.239> line<00:03:09.690> around<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.470> phone

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
does is create a line around the phone

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.440 
does is create a line around the phone
which<00:03:11.790> then<00:03:13.070> creates<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.700> little<00:03:15.239> bit<00:03:15.420> of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
which then creates just a little bit of

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.090 
which then creates just a little bit of
extra<00:03:16.220> around<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.489> sides<00:03:18.019> that's<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
extra around the sides that's it the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.300 
extra around the sides that's it the
gold<00:03:20.430> shines<00:03:20.910> through<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.560> great<00:03:23.070> for

if you look on the tech 21 website you

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.230 
if you look on the tech 21 website you
will<00:04:43.680> also<00:04:43.919> find<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.729> there<00:04:44.940> are<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> variety

this band already in put it into the
case<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.220> therefore<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.330> not<00:04:54.539> two<00:04:54.870> separate

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
case and therefore it's not two separate
