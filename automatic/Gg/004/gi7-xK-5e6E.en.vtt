like<00:05:14.900> this<00:05:15.020> level<00:05:15.350> it's<00:05:15.530> not<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:15.860> difficult

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
like this level it's not that difficult

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.600 
like this level it's not that difficult
is<00:05:16.910> simple<00:05:18.610> perhaps<00:05:19.610> that's<00:05:19.790> why<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.120> like<00:05:20.270> it

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
