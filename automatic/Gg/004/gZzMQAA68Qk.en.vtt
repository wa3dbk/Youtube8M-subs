three and four hundred dollars on a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.130 
three and four hundred dollars on a
machine<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.360> comes<00:02:12.600> with<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> hundred

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
machine that comes with a hundred

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.290 
machine that comes with a hundred
stitches<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.250> you're<00:02:14.610> never<00:02:14.820> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.120> use

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
stitches and you're never going to use

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.550 
stitches and you're never going to use
any<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.870> them<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.490> suggest<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.420> find<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
any of them I suggest that you find a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
any of them I suggest that you find a
machine<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:20.340> comes<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.940> basic

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
machine that comes with the basic

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.230 
machine that comes with the basic
stitches<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.740> reason<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> price<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.850> this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
stitches for a reason a price in this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.170 
stitches for a reason a price in this
way<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.840> won't<00:02:24.990> waste<00:02:25.320> money<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:26.160> bring<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
way you won't waste money I bring a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.630 
way you won't waste money I bring a
price<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> most

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
price because that's really the most

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.510 
price because that's really the most
important<00:02:30.209> thing<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.690> need<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.520> understand

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
important thing you need to understand

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.130 
important thing you need to understand
when<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.090> get<00:02:33.240> ready<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.570> buy<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> sewing

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
when you get ready to buy a sewing

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.590 
when you get ready to buy a sewing
machine<00:02:34.230> because<00:02:34.890> sewing<00:02:35.220> machines<00:02:35.640> can

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
machine because sewing machines can

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.410 
machine because sewing machines can
range<00:02:36.900> from<00:02:37.140> very<00:02:37.680> low<00:02:38.070> price<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:39.120> very

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
range from very low price to very

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.130 
range from very low price to very
expensive<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:41.090> personally<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.510> know<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.930> lot<00:02:43.110> of

use<00:02:47.250> two<00:02:47.550> or<00:02:47.580> three<00:02:47.850> stitches<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.630> they

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
use two or three stitches and they

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.890 
use two or three stitches and they
couldn't<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.470> got<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:50.520> same<00:02:50.940> quality

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
couldn't have got this same quality

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.250 
couldn't have got this same quality
machine<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.370> lot<00:02:53.730> less<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.020> first

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
machine for a lot less so the first

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.199 
machine for a lot less so the first
thing<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.620> really<00:02:55.860> want<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.700> decide

between<00:02:57.570> whether<00:02:58.050> or<00:02:58.140> not<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.620> want<00:02:58.800> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
between whether or not you want to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.670 
between whether or not you want to
industry<00:02:59.340> machine<00:02:59.760> or<00:03:00.030> home<00:03:00.480> machine<00:03:00.900> once

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
industry machine or home machine once

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.100 
industry machine or home machine once
you<00:03:01.830> make<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.070> decision<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.000> must<00:03:03.660> set<00:03:04.080> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
you make that decision you must set a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.830 
you make that decision you must set a
budget<00:03:04.500> because<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.120> decide<00:03:06.420> what

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
budget because then you can decide what

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.600 
budget because then you can decide what
machine<00:03:07.320> would<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.709> best<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.370> within

machine would be best for you within
your<00:03:08.910> budget<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.620> last<00:03:10.890> thing<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.340> should

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
your budget the last thing you should

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.720 
your budget the last thing you should
consider<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.540> usage<00:03:13.080> meaning<00:03:13.920> how<00:03:14.190> often

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
consider is the usage meaning how often

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.210 
consider is the usage meaning how often
you<00:03:14.970> plan<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.239> use<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.780> machine<00:03:16.110> once<00:03:16.860> again

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
you plan to use the machine once again

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.640 
you plan to use the machine once again
if<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.519> plan<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> lot<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.570> sewing<00:03:19.110> I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
if you plan to do a lot of sewing I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.400 
if you plan to do a lot of sewing I
suggest<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.940> do<00:03:21.209> invest<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.200> good

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
suggest that you do invest in a good

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.740 
suggest that you do invest in a good
quality<00:03:22.470> machine<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.730> may<00:03:24.000> cost<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.630> little

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
quality machine that may cost a little

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.780 
quality machine that may cost a little
bit<00:03:24.900> more<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.100> end<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.610> would

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
bit more but in the end you would

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.270 
bit more but in the end you would
definitely<00:03:27.030> get<00:03:27.480> your<00:03:27.690> money's<00:03:28.019> worth<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:28.860> you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
definitely get your money's worth if you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.550 
definitely get your money's worth if you
don't<00:03:29.580> plan<00:03:29.820> on<00:03:29.880> doing<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.269> lot<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.450> sewing<00:03:30.780> get

don't plan on doing a lot of sewing get

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.550 
don't plan on doing a lot of sewing get
something<00:03:32.010> very<00:03:32.269> inexpensive<00:03:33.269> but<00:03:33.959> would<00:03:34.380> do

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
something very inexpensive but would do

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
something very inexpensive but would do
