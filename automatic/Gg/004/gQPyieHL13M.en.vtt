00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
just could feel coming a mile away all

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
course they get the cover and the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.650 
course they get the cover and the
outright<00:01:42.800> win<00:01:43.099> personal<00:01:43.759> quarterback<00:01:44.179> played

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
outright win personal quarterback played

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.370

very<00:01:44.929> well

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
very well

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.719 
very well
losing<00:01:45.770> Trent<00:01:45.979> Richardson<00:01:46.160> didn't<00:01:46.580> really

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
losing Trent Richardson didn't really

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.309 
losing Trent Richardson didn't really
matter<00:01:46.849> the<00:01:47.030> return<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.330> Josh<00:01:47.720> Gordon<00:01:48.020> though

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
matter the return of Josh Gordon though

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.260 
matter the return of Josh Gordon though
I<00:01:48.530> think<00:01:48.920> did<00:01:49.130> make<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> big<00:01:49.670> difference<00:01:49.819> and<00:01:50.119> we

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
I think did make a big difference and we

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.150 
I think did make a big difference and we
did<00:01:50.450> see<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.810> one<00:01:50.959> coming<00:01:51.349> here<00:01:51.800> though

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
did see that one coming here though

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.469 
did see that one coming here though

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
it's a no joke team they've got a great

defense great weapons on offense the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.710 
defense great weapons on offense the
only<00:02:01.130> maybe<00:02:01.369> issue<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:01.970> consistency<00:02:02.569> of

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
only maybe issue is a consistency of

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.080 
only maybe issue is a consistency of
Andy<00:02:03.349> Dalton<00:02:03.739> but<00:02:04.160> other<00:02:04.340> than<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.970> know

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
Andy Dalton but other than that you know

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.330 
Andy Dalton but other than that you know
this<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.450> top<00:02:05.720> top<00:02:06.020> team<00:02:06.410> it's<00:02:07.009> great<00:02:07.220> what

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
this is a top top team it's great what

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.010 
this is a top top team it's great what
did<00:02:07.520> what<00:02:07.759> Cleveland<00:02:08.209> was<00:02:08.330> able<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.599> do<00:02:08.810> last

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
did what Cleveland was able to do last

week<00:02:09.319> with<00:02:09.530> their<00:02:09.709> with<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.069> know<00:02:10.190> get<00:02:10.459> it

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
week with their with you know get it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.949 
week with their with you know get it
pulling<00:02:10.700> out<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.940> surprise<00:02:11.270> win<00:02:11.599> I'm

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
pulling out the surprise win I'm

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.600 
pulling out the surprise win I'm
thinking<00:02:12.349> maybe<00:02:12.470> Cincinnati<00:02:13.010> -<00:02:13.190> four<00:02:13.489> as<00:02:13.580> a

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
thinking maybe Cincinnati - four as a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.270 
thinking maybe Cincinnati - four as a
side<00:02:13.819> here<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:15.160> know<00:02:16.160> I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
side here is that what you like I know I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.589 
side here is that what you like I know I
actually<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.819> other<00:02:16.970> side<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.239> like

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
actually like the other side I like

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.750 
actually like the other side I like
reeling<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.230> game<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
reeling in this game and it's a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.010 
reeling in this game and it's a
dangerous<00:02:20.090> pick<00:02:20.360> obviously<00:02:20.720> because<00:02:20.930> you

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
dangerous pick obviously because you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.500 
dangerous pick obviously because you
know<00:02:21.080> he's<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:21.830> good<00:02:22.070> team<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:23.180> saw<00:02:23.360> what

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
know he's a very good team we saw what

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.330 
know he's a very good team we saw what
he<00:02:23.570> did<00:02:23.690> last<00:02:23.930> week<00:02:24.200> against<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.590> Packers<00:02:24.860> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
he did last week against the Packers and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.230 
he did last week against the Packers and
all

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
all

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.820 
all
the<00:02:26.360> Packers<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.870> Adam<00:02:27.440> pretty<00:02:27.710> much

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the Packers you know Adam pretty much

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.520 
the Packers you know Adam pretty much
buried<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.430> game<00:02:28.640> at<00:02:29.150> one<00:02:29.330> point<00:02:29.570> at<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
buried in that game at one point at the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.990 
buried in that game at one point at the
other<00:02:30.650> day<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> mean<00:02:31.040> they<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.490> they<00:02:31.610> give<00:02:31.730> up<00:02:31.880> a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
other day I mean they and they give up a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.550 
other day I mean they and they give up a
lot<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.300> rushing<00:02:32.720> yards<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.230> may<00:02:33.410> which

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
lot of rushing yards that we may which

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.950 
lot of rushing yards that we may which
is<00:02:33.710> very<00:02:33.890> surprising<00:02:34.210> but<00:02:35.210> they<00:02:35.300> held<00:02:35.480> Aaron

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
is very surprising but they held Aaron

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.630 
is very surprising but they held Aaron
Rodgers<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.470> four<00:02:36.680> point<00:02:36.920> four<00:02:37.160> four<00:02:37.370> point

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
Rodgers to four point four four point

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.920 
Rodgers to four point four four point
sixty<00:02:37.880> yards<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.120> pass<00:02:38.300> something<00:02:38.570> like<00:02:38.660> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
sixty yards the pass something like that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.920 
sixty yards the pass something like that
and<00:02:39.740> intercept<00:02:40.190> him<00:02:40.400> twice<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.090> Rodgers<00:02:41.720> just

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
and intercept him twice and Rodgers just

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.450 
and intercept him twice and Rodgers just
doesn't<00:02:42.170> get<00:02:42.230> intercepted<00:02:42.800> twice<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.250> game

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
doesn't get intercepted twice in a game

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.950 
doesn't get intercepted twice in a game
and<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.090> doesn't<00:02:44.360> happen<00:02:44.480> again

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
and it just doesn't happen again

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.900 
and it just doesn't happen again
so<00:02:45.920> babbles<00:02:46.220> burying<00:02:46.490> precedent<00:02:46.850> for

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
so babbles burying precedent for

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.160 
so babbles burying precedent for
Cincinnati<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.540> they've<00:02:47.660> added<00:02:47.840> down<00:02:48.140> a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
Cincinnati and they've added down a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.660 
Cincinnati and they've added down a
whole<00:02:48.440> bunch<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.740> balls<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.190> Rodgers<00:02:49.550> is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
whole bunch of balls that Rodgers is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.430 
whole bunch of balls that Rodgers is
throwing<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.750> there's<00:02:50.930> no<00:02:51.050> questions

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
throwing and there's no questions

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.070 
throwing and there's no questions
defense<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.920> very<00:02:52.130> good<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:53.030> Cleveland<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.810> I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
defense is very good but Cleveland is I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.510 
defense is very good but Cleveland is I
think<00:02:54.500> they're<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> bit<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.950> an<00:02:55.070> underrated

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
think they're a bit of an underrated

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.460 
think they're a bit of an underrated
paint<00:02:56.030> team<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.600> it's<00:02:56.960> always<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> question

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
obviously Richardson's gone but I think

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.900

you're<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:04.580> Peter

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910

week<00:04:31.790> so<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:33.230> know<00:04:33.320> hopefully<00:04:33.530> they're<00:04:34.070> not

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
week so you know hopefully they're not

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.620 
week so you know hopefully they're not
just<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.460> gland<00:04:34.760> offense<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.360> they're<00:04:35.450> getting

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
just a gland offense and they're getting

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.780 
just a gland offense and they're getting
a<00:04:35.690> little<00:04:35.900> bit<00:04:35.990> more<00:04:36.140> creative<00:04:36.470> as<00:04:36.650> well<00:04:36.830> I

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
a little bit more creative as well I

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.030 
a little bit more creative as well I
just<00:04:38.210> think<00:04:38.540> taking<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.900> points<00:04:39.290> as<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.590> live

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
just think taking the points as a live

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.640 
just think taking the points as a live
including<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.910> live<00:04:41.060> dog<00:04:41.330> here<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.440> I<00:04:42.530> only

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
including the live dog here and I only

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.440 
including the live dog here and I only
protect<00:04:43.010> about<00:04:43.190> 34<00:04:43.580> points<00:04:43.910> in<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.090> game<00:04:44.150> so

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
protect about 34 points in this game so

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.580 
protect about 34 points in this game so
I'm<00:04:44.510> not<00:04:44.630> going<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.840> say<00:04:45.020> I'm<00:04:45.110> playing<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.500> end

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I'm not going to say I'm playing the end

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.500 
I'm not going to say I'm playing the end
there<00:04:45.740> okay<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.520> think<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.820> will<00:04:46.910> be<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.090> lost<00:04:47.300> run

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
there okay I think it will be a lost run

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.120 
there okay I think it will be a lost run
game<00:04:47.690> both<00:04:47.900> these<00:04:48.080> teams<00:04:48.260> are<00:04:48.470> very<00:04:48.650> very<00:04:48.950> good

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
game both these teams are very very good

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.700 
game both these teams are very very good
defensively<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.230> think<00:04:51.410> Cleveland

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
defensively and and I think Cleveland

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.930 
defensively and and I think Cleveland
can<00:04:51.860> stay<00:04:52.010> within<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.340> number<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.670> this<00:04:52.760> game

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
can stay within the number in this game

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.910 
can stay within the number in this game
Cleveland<00:04:53.630> as<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.840> home<00:04:54.170> dog<00:04:54.410> getting<00:04:54.650> four

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
Cleveland as a home dog getting four

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.920 
Cleveland as a home dog getting four
points<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.460> Scott<00:04:55.790> Kellan's<00:04:56.240> pick<00:04:56.480> thanks<00:04:56.780> God
