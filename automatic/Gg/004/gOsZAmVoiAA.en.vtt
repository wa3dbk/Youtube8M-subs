the<00:00:18.660> game<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.609> kind<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.060> had<00:00:21.570> an

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the game so right here I kind of had an

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.390 
the game so right here I kind of had an
old<00:00:21.900> save<00:00:22.260> which<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.039> needed<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
old save which is I really needed it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
old save which is I really needed it
because<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> beat<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.510> missions<00:00:24.990> but

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
because I beat all my missions but

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.339 
because I beat all my missions but
trevor<00:00:26.010> has<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.730> mission<00:00:27.300> where<00:00:27.539> he<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.289> he
