we're propagating Savio leucantha our
Mexican<00:00:02.730> bush<00:00:02.879> sage<00:00:03.120> from<00:00:03.589> cuttings<00:00:04.589> and

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
Mexican bush sage from cuttings and

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.670 
Mexican bush sage from cuttings and
we're<00:00:06.299> going<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> need<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.779> water<00:00:07.350> them<00:00:07.560> in

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
we're going to need to water them in

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.030 
we're going to need to water them in
once<00:00:08.040> we've<00:00:08.189> got<00:00:08.370> them<00:00:09.230> put<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.469> cells<00:00:10.710> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
once we've got them put in the cells and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120 
once we've got them put in the cells and
in<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.190> potting<00:00:11.519> soil<00:00:12.349> but<00:00:13.349> not<00:00:13.559> keep<00:00:13.799> them<00:00:13.950> so

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
in the potting soil but not keep them so

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
in the potting soil but not keep them so
wet<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:15.179> they<00:00:15.330> get<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:18.090> leaf<00:00:18.420> stay<00:00:18.660> wet

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
wet that that they get the leaf stay wet

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.849 
wet that that they get the leaf stay wet
they<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.380> good<00:00:19.560> air<00:00:19.680> circulation

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
they need to have good air circulation

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
they need to have good air circulation
so<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> leaves<00:00:20.670> will<00:00:20.820> dry<00:00:20.970> off<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.330> they

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
so the leaves will dry off so they

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.349 
so the leaves will dry off so they
weren't<00:00:21.720> real<00:00:21.869> fungus<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.380> all<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:23.359> it'll

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
weren't real fungus and all that it'll

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.609 
weren't real fungus and all that it'll
take<00:00:24.510> several<00:00:24.689> weeks<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.109> these<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> root

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
take several weeks for these to root

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.689 
take several weeks for these to root
down<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> usually<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:29.340> find<00:00:29.490> out

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
down what I usually do is to find out

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880 
down what I usually do is to find out
whether<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.590> got<00:00:31.590> through

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
whether or not I've got got through

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.580 
whether or not I've got got through
coming<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.090> pick<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.329> these<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:34.110> flats

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
coming you can pick up these these flats

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.020 
coming you can pick up these these flats
and<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.640> holes<00:00:35.820> down

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and you can see the little holes down

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
and you can see the little holes down
here<00:00:36.410> these<00:00:37.410> roots<00:00:37.649> will<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.100> deep<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
here these roots will go very deep and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.930 
here these roots will go very deep and
the<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.719> first<00:00:39.960> roots<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.680> come<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.100> will

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the very first roots that come out will

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.369 
the very first roots that come out will
make<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> beeline<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.050> these<00:00:43.170> holes

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
make a beeline for one of these holes

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
make a beeline for one of these holes
right<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.890> you'll<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.100> white<00:00:44.670> roots

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
right here and you'll see white roots

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.250 
right here and you'll see white roots
sticking<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> these<00:00:45.660> holes<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> you'll

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
sticking out of these holes and you'll

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.869 
sticking out of these holes and you'll
know<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.800> they've<00:00:47.190> rooted<00:00:47.520> down<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
know that that they've rooted down and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.860 
know that that they've rooted down and
that<00:00:47.969> you've<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:49.520> conceivably<00:00:50.870> enough

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that you've got conceivably enough

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.920 
that you've got conceivably enough
plants<00:00:52.170> enough<00:00:53.010> roots<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.660> conceivably<00:00:54.660> set

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
plants enough roots to conceivably set

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
plants enough roots to conceivably set
to<00:00:55.050> another<00:00:55.260> location<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> larger

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
to another location but or to a larger
pot<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> pull<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
pot but you want to pull them up and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.990 
pot but you want to pull them up and
take<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> look<00:01:01.010> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.219> grab<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> hold<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> plant

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
take a look if you grab a hold of plant

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
take a look if you grab a hold of plant
and<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.570> plant<00:01:03.690> basically<00:01:04.049> comes<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.920> what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and the plant basically comes or what

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
and the plant basically comes or what
looks<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> wants<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> pull<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.330> without

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
looks like it wants to pull out without

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
looks like it wants to pull out without
lifting<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.380> into<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> soil<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> probably

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
lifting up into the soil you probably

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.350 
lifting up into the soil you probably
don't<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.640> many<00:01:08.729> roots<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> thank

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
cultivation practices and had a whole

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
cultivation practices and had a whole
bunch<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.000> roots<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.689> put<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bunch of roots on it and I just put it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
bunch of roots on it and I just put it
in<00:01:25.320> some<00:01:25.530> potting<00:01:25.860> soil<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:27.450> expect<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
in some potting soil and I expect it to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.760 
in some potting soil and I expect it to
do<00:01:28.320> quite<00:01:28.560> well<00:01:29.420> much<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.600> dividing<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> clump

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
do quite well much like dividing a clump

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.580 
do quite well much like dividing a clump
of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.400> plant<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.540> making<00:01:33.960> numerous<00:01:34.320> plants

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
of the plant and making numerous plants

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.370 
of the plant and making numerous plants
out<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.070> root<00:01:35.850> ball<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.049> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
out of a root ball this is kind of the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
out of a root ball this is kind of the
same<00:01:37.590> idea<00:01:39.500> salvia<00:01:40.500> leucantha<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.280> Texas

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
same idea salvia leucantha is a Texas

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.960 
same idea salvia leucantha is a Texas
native<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> very<00:01:43.229> tough<00:01:43.500> plant<00:01:44.430> makes<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
native it's a very tough plant makes a

native it's a very tough plant makes a
beautiful<00:01:45.619> purple<00:01:48.259> almost<00:01:49.259> foxtail<00:01:50.009> looking

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
beautiful purple almost foxtail looking

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
beautiful purple almost foxtail looking
bloom<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.860> comes<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> fall<00:01:54.000> it's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
bloom that comes on in the fall it's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.340 
bloom that comes on in the fall it's
quite<00:01:54.450> quite<00:01:54.750> striking<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:57.079> believe<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> is

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
quite quite striking and I believe it is
