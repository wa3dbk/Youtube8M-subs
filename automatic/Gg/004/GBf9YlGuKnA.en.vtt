00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.540
 So Simon plays muscle maker in 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.790
 this video is about bz what are 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 actually pcs and embarrassed why are 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 she is as important as the whole country 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.029
 I have here of time critical the toilet 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 rx that's the word on it 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.539
 strictly speaking, this abbreviation this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.100
 curious where you are, of course, as all 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 first asks what does actually mean 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.519
 Often this abbreviation will get away from it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.710
 assumed that it is the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.400
 initial letters of four amino acids 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.019
 would have to be 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 however, it will be difficult for her four 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.380
 amino acids and so find where the whole 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.390
 Fits and looks at the ingredient list 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.050
 You can find the whole course already 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.579
 expose 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 because here are only three amino acids 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.710
 contain these are the three amino acids 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.500
 leucine lg solar pull and el ouali the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 These are called jokes 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.539
 Abbreviation stands for brandt change amino 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.370
 acids to german branched amino acids 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.680
 grow to do the chemical structure 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 has that they are always two chain if 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.649
 one now further questions what can 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.539
 she was actually one for me 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.300
 effective you will come to the point that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.309
 Essential amino acids are essential 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.659
 amino acids are those amino acids 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.400
 that the body does not make itself 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.470
 So you can not synthesize yourself 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 but through the approach through 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.010
 the food must be supplied 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 that means it's a very special one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 important amino acids the body 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
 may need to work with and out 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.450
 even went over a very complex 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 the nonessential process 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.500
 amino acids can produce itself is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.270
 Of course very important at the place 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.710
 play these essential amino acids 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.990
 course, a very important role in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.479
 Feeding everything you need as avenger 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 Costs have a certain amount on him 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.310
 amino acids and of course the question 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 how strong these bi cass are 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.240
 just in a definition phase in the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.460
 Diet where you have to do without many things 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.479
 the bca it's very important it has to do with it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.790
 do that body someday 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.200
 Lack of condition has over this lack to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 Example of carbohydrates in the low 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.680
 carb diet must be the head on petter and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.790
 in a way to gain energy 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.259
 To fall back on 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.659
 but also about a normal one 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.250
 diet is the body in need 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 offset it means the body already has 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.810
 where does he get his energy and there 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.210
 It can also happen that the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.040
 distributed in amino acid metabolism 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.690
 are citric acid cycle and so on 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.000
 and so on it can do so 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 come that the body to amino acids 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.380
 energy recovery is currently in use 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.090
 definition phase is so important on 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.950
 to pay attention to these important amino acids 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.819
 So here maybe synonymous with this pcs 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 to work 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.510
 in the master phase is simply the question 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.220
 Do I really need them or will I? 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.080
 by protein powder and by one 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.920
 protein-rich nutrition also to mean so 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.030
 amino acids 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.470
 That's a question everyone is asking 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.870
 I have to ask for my part 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.730
 say in the definition phase of a diet 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 for me very important in the mass 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.000
 phase I do not necessarily need them 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.410
 that means I either pack 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.030
 empty I did not open it anymore 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.709
 or I take very easy 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.630
 temporarily not at all and if I then 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.220
 a phase definition, they are going 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.360
 fear there is very important here 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.700
 of course always the question namely the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.290
 Packing with 120 capsules that fits 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.599
 perfect for your sports bag 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.970
 or in any glove box or viz 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.380
 The supply pack with 330 capsule 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.910
 they are of course individual 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.390
 capsule down a bit 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.980
 better 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.690
 which one can be wonderful who is so in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.890
 let the kitchen stand and then turn 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.019
 you simply took the pictures 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.910
 half asleep number 3 45 capsules out 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.290
 It is wonderful to swallow 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.359
 Of course, a very comfortable thing 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.310
 Overall , I joined in any case 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.989
 at the bca products on a good 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.519
 We have access to quality here 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.829
 for example these three important ones 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.540
 Amino acids contain the capsule 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.489
 made of pork branche land him 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 also normal for those who are important 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.640
 want to pay attention otherwise 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.709
 nothing else contains none 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.239
 additives no fillers nothing 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.639
 Unfortunately, it is often in the East and 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.709
 Lack of quality you have somewhere that 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.310
 because it is advertised with the bca as 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.170
 prince 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.819
 if you look closely is there too 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.290
 still a lot of other things in it 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.150
 you are not at all to yourself 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.650
 I would like to take it on everyone 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.780
 very important , i just said so 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.819
 the definition phase is simple 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.900
 a convenient income opportunity and 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.609
 especially on empty stomach 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.829
 after training it makes sense to 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.090
 first pcs to lead the body 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.010
 him with these very important ones 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.650
 that clearly provides so much for everything 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.730
 theme pcs and these pcs from early on 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.530
 meanwhile you can find it in the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.970
 muscle maker shop the link to the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.739
 I'll give you a video description 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.060
 See you in the next video many 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.060
 greetings your singing
