of<00:03:00.099> spring-trap<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.390> second<00:03:01.780> theory<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.349> that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
of spring-trap the second theory is that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.580 
of spring-trap the second theory is that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
flash drop is a minion of spring-trap

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.650 
flash drop is a minion of spring-trap
for<00:03:06.099> example<00:03:06.459> nightmare<00:03:06.849> Freddy<00:03:07.120> had<00:03:07.420> few

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
for example nightmare Freddy had few

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.900 
for example nightmare Freddy had few
minions<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.260> nightmare<00:03:08.950> chica<00:03:09.190> had<00:03:09.549> human

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
minions and nightmare chica had human

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.839 
minions and nightmare chica had human
yin<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.329> its<00:03:10.810> nightmare<00:03:11.500> cake<00:03:11.769> do<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.549> see

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
yin to its nightmare cake do you see

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.039 
yin to its nightmare cake do you see
what<00:03:13.060> I'm<00:03:13.239> talking<00:03:13.569> about

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
what I'm talking about

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.460 
what I'm talking about
if<00:03:14.380> that's<00:03:14.919> menial<00:03:15.549> offspring<00:03:16.239> from<00:03:16.419> then<00:03:16.810> we

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
if that's menial offspring from then we

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.430 
if that's menial offspring from then we
still<00:03:17.919> didn't<00:03:18.459> see<00:03:18.700> spring<00:03:19.269> shop<00:03:19.540> himself<00:03:20.109> and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
still didn't see spring shop himself and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.759 
still didn't see spring shop himself and
probably<00:03:20.769> he<00:03:21.700> will<00:03:21.940> come<00:03:22.269> back<00:03:22.569> in<00:03:22.930> F&amp;F<00:03:23.440> for

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
probably he will come back in F&amp;F for

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.930 
probably he will come back in F&amp;F for
later<00:03:24.459> because<00:03:25.120> he<00:03:25.599> always<00:03:25.840> does<00:03:26.349> also<00:03:27.220> not<00:03:27.639> a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
later because he always does also not a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.479 
later because he always does also not a
purple<00:03:28.690> thing<00:03:28.989> at<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.440> right<00:03:29.590> side<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.220> hard

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
purple thing at the right side it's hard

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.629 
purple thing at the right side it's hard
to<00:03:30.730> say<00:03:30.940> what<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.260> may<00:03:32.650> be<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.980> cheap<00:03:33.400> the

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
to say what is but it may be a cheap the

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.640 
to say what is but it may be a cheap the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
purple guy at blush drop are somehow

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.270 
purple guy at blush drop are somehow
