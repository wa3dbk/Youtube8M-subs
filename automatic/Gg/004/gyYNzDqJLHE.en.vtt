I<00:00:00.149> hope<00:00:01.020> writing<00:00:01.469> those<00:00:01.650> in<00:00:01.860> didn't<00:00:02.190> take<00:00:02.370> you

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
I hope writing those in didn't take you

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.960 
I hope writing those in didn't take you
that<00:00:02.700> long<00:00:03.440> now<00:00:04.440> let's<00:00:04.830> hear<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.160> process<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
that long now let's hear the process of

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.839 
that long now let's hear the process of
gradual<00:00:06.540> elaboration<00:00:07.350> which<00:00:07.670> connects<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
gradual elaboration which connects the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.570 
gradual elaboration which connects the
middle<00:00:09.150> ground<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.990> foreground<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.889> then

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
middle ground to the foreground and then

00:00:11.580 --> 00:01:27.130 
middle ground to the foreground and then
to<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> full<00:00:12.179> score

I<00:01:32.979> hope<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.250> agree<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:35.180> helps<00:01:35.570> us<00:01:35.659> get

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
I hope you agree that this helps us get

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.649 
I hope you agree that this helps us get
closer<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.650> understanding<00:01:37.180> Mozart's<00:01:38.180> musical

of summarizing the sort of analysis
we've<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.300> been<00:02:14.510> doing<00:02:14.720> by<00:02:15.560> using<00:02:15.620> notation
