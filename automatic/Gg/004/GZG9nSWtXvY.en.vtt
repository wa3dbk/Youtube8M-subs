00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.020
 then people who breed here and what 's added 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.280
 another new shannon stays on this 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.570
 my channel breeds gaming 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.610
 there are places for free 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.990
 album on hijacked and I'm going to try it 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.660
 especially flying car game to win if we do not 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.189
 all nine 20 kills behind with only 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.170
 one point to use so my class and 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.940
 thar no secondary shakers no this 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.350
 yet no tact add a field cars and the 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.670
 potty looks just started are three 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.250
 guys made, we can still be good 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.710
 make 4 kills of course still 4 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.540
 kills and try to win this game 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760
 the problem is in black us 2 you get 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.170
 ten points to create your class with 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.239
 I put your 10-point secondary in it 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.829
 two and one point lost and tess corn syrup 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.059
 lost one or two points and so on 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.120
 etcetera and what is this again for 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.040
 span is span is a target man and you 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 I just need 10 points you share 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.340
 easily win such a pot 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.930
 First you have or so invited two 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.390
 who needed him text 10 and so on 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.520
 etcetera you just need those points 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.899
 that you can spend because different 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.219
 two just at a disadvantage opposite the 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.320
 other and the is and now because I only have one 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.910
 point I have so this is in it 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.590
 focus goes firstly no toughness 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.149
 which means if someone touches me 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.619
 target point flies up and so I him 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.149
 no more camping the second I have none 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.740
 expert those modules no longer fast 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.209
 cost-free also sprinting 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.770
 Fourth I don't have a flexchair is like 

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.819
 someone used for this I am anyway 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.560
 it wants 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.729
 etcetera etcetera I can still do one 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.170
 hope we keep zeros why me 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.550
 because of this I am at a disadvantage and we are going 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.450
 just try the jar find it 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.950
 is nice to do this 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.390
 that was of course with the scenes that 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.929
 you already face 8 and i just go 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.700
 to attempt 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.560
 I have dior evie anyway you stretch the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 core them if you go above your red 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.080
 with for after 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.789
 if i win the find it good if i do 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.869
 I lose it was not good your channel 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.819
 He jumped down following 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.679
 I no way dick death over him there 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.000
 Also yes good but nice to him 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.190
 above you I think it's all right 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.550
 nice cozy hero 3 someone dead 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.470

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.190
 walk reload record record 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.690
 those are all things you care about 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.739
 it just like you play call or duty or there 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.390
 someone reload 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:58.030
 if anyone is grilling something in the game 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.200
 usually your character saves you 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.569
 should pay attention to your footsteps 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.190
 course around you today 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.720
 you also often help yourself 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.649
 and save your life very often 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.479
 with it 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.509
 and you just have to stay on everything just 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.580

 30 a of course to be mainly political 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.700
 can win 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.030
 the guy is dead because who's back soon 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.190
