00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.040 

so<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.319> addition<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.519> effective<00:00:09.420> climbing<00:00:09.870> and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
so in addition to effective climbing and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.169 
so in addition to effective climbing and
effective<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.620> footwork<00:00:11.160> we're<00:00:11.759> gonna<00:00:11.880> take

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
effective for footwork we're gonna take

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879 
effective for footwork we're gonna take
a<00:00:12.210> little<00:00:12.480> bit<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> look<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.139> heel<00:00:13.500> hooking

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
a little bit of a look at heel hooking

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.680 
a little bit of a look at heel hooking
and<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> benefits<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> heel<00:00:15.030> hooks<00:00:15.440> so

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
and the benefits of heel hooks so

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.820 
and the benefits of heel hooks so
benefiting<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:18.779> heel<00:00:19.020> hooking<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.650> can

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
benefiting from heel hooking is you can

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.509 
benefiting from heel hooking is you can
use<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.699> leg<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.039> specifically<00:00:23.039> your<00:00:23.250> tap

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
use your leg and specifically your tap

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.689 
use your leg and specifically your tap
to<00:00:24.410> transfer<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.560> bodyweight<00:00:26.010> where<00:00:26.460> you

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to transfer your bodyweight where you

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.460 
to transfer your bodyweight where you
may<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.119> normally<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.810> able<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.050> use<00:00:28.289> your

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
may not normally be able to use your

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.389 
may not normally be able to use your
arms<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> pull<00:00:29.130> yourself<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.480> easily<00:00:31.399> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
arms to pull yourself over as easily you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.920 
arms to pull yourself over as easily you
probably<00:00:32.700> could<00:00:32.940> still<00:00:33.239> use<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.540> arms<00:00:33.780> but

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
probably could still use your arms but

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.180 
probably could still use your arms but
it<00:00:33.989> would<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.230> more<00:00:34.440> energy<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.070> we're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
it would take more energy so we're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
it would take more energy so we're
trying<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> again<00:00:35.910> conserve<00:00:36.660> energy<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> get

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
trying to again conserve energy and get

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
trying to again conserve energy and get
you<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> climb<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.340> efficiently<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.020> will

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you to climb more efficiently so I will

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.160 
you to climb more efficiently so I will
demonstrate<00:00:40.910> with<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.239> without<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> heel<00:00:42.930> hook

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
demonstrate with and without a heel hook

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.400 
demonstrate with and without a heel hook
trying<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.639 

using<00:00:47.410> your<00:00:47.680> heel<00:00:48.039> on<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:49.059> hold<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:50.260> using

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
using your heel on a hold and then using

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.080 
using your heel on a hold and then using
your<00:00:50.769> leg<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.129> pull<00:00:51.370> your<00:00:51.519> body<00:00:51.730> weight<00:00:52.059> over

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
your leg to pull your body weight over

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.530 
your leg to pull your body weight over
this<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:53.019> very<00:00:53.230> useful<00:00:53.649> makes<00:00:54.399> longer<00:00:55.300> reach

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
this is very useful makes longer reach

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.170 
this is very useful makes longer reach
longer<00:00:56.469> reaches<00:00:56.890> much<00:00:57.370> easier<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:57.940> much<00:00:58.120> more

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
longer reaches much easier and much more

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.020 
longer reaches much easier and much more
obtainable<00:00:58.769> so<00:00:59.769> what<00:01:00.219> I<00:01:00.250> just<00:01:00.519> did<00:01:00.670> there<00:01:00.730> you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
obtainable so what I just did there you

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.119 
obtainable so what I just did there you
saw<00:01:01.269> was<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.839> good<00:01:02.110> example<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.680> a<00:01:02.769> heel<00:01:02.979> hook

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
saw was a good example of a heel hook

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.740 
saw was a good example of a heel hook
that<00:01:03.399> made<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.820> much<00:01:04.000> easier<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.509> get

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
that made it much easier to get

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.050 
that made it much easier to get
something<00:01:05.229> now<00:01:05.920> here<00:01:06.190> I<00:01:06.220> tried<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.670> same<00:01:06.880> move

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
something now here I tried the same move

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.789 
something now here I tried the same move
without<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.420> heel<00:01:07.720> hook<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.259> can't<00:01:08.530> reach

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
without a heel hook and I can't reach

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.969 
without a heel hook and I can't reach
the<00:01:09.040> hold<00:01:09.690> just<00:01:10.690> going<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.140> prove<00:01:11.440> how<00:01:11.740> much

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
the hold just going to prove how much

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.420 
the hold just going to prove how much
how<00:01:12.729> useful<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.570> heel<00:01:13.810> hook<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.590> so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
how useful that heel hook really is so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.130 
how useful that heel hook really is so
again<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.729> want<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:15.970> place<00:01:16.210> your<00:01:16.240> heel<00:01:16.659> on<00:01:16.960> to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
again you want to place your heel on to

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.560 
again you want to place your heel on to
the<00:01:17.229> hold<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:18.429> want<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.759> make<00:01:19.090> sure<00:01:19.119> it's<00:01:19.450> on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
the hold you want to make sure it's on

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.510 
the hold you want to make sure it's on
there<00:01:19.720> firmly<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.410> you're<00:01:21.100> going<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.280> use

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
there firmly and you're going to use

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.460 
there firmly and you're going to use
your<00:01:21.700> leg<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.270> actually<00:01:22.660> pull<00:01:22.960> your<00:01:23.200> body

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
your leg to actually pull your body

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.639 
your leg to actually pull your body
weight<00:01:23.770> over<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> side<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.179> then<00:01:25.869> again

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
weight over to the side and then again

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.889 
weight over to the side and then again
making<00:01:27.399> sure<00:01:27.580> you're<00:01:27.759> exhaling<00:01:28.240> during<00:01:28.720> all

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
making sure you're exhaling during all

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.169 
making sure you're exhaling during all
this<00:01:29.110> reach<00:01:30.070> up<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.490> grab<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.729> hold<00:01:31.060> that

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
this reach up and grab the hold that

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:38.060 
this reach up and grab the hold that
you're<00:01:31.330> aiming<00:01:31.659> for

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.560 

so<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.430> close-up<00:01:39.700> example<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.450> how

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
so this is a close-up example of how

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.150 
so this is a close-up example of how
we're<00:01:40.750> gonna<00:01:40.810> place<00:01:41.140> our<00:01:41.320> heel<00:01:41.620> on<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:41.920> hold

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
we're gonna place our heel on the hold

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.910 
we're gonna place our heel on the hold
you<00:01:42.940> want<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.150> make<00:01:43.330> sure<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:44.500> your<00:01:44.680> heel<00:01:44.890> on

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
you want to make sure get your heel on

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.430 
you want to make sure get your heel on
there<00:01:45.250> it's<00:01:45.730> good<00:01:45.970> good<00:01:46.360> contact<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.320> can

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
there it's good good contact and it can

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.500 
there it's good good contact and it can
support<00:01:47.920> your<00:01:48.160> body<00:01:48.400> weight<00:01:48.550> now<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.330> is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
support your body weight now that is

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.400 
support your body weight now that is
very<00:01:49.570> important

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
very important

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.620 
very important
because<00:01:50.710> if<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.070> heel<00:01:51.310> slips<00:01:51.700> off<00:01:51.940> your

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
because if that heel slips off your

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.150 
because if that heel slips off your
ankle<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.080> going<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.320> be<00:01:53.500> bleeding

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.620 

so<00:01:59.160> again<00:01:59.430> checking<00:01:59.820> at<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.150> different<00:02:00.510> angle

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so again checking at a different angle

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.110 
so again checking at a different angle
we're<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.920> he'll<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.520> placed<00:02:02.790> on

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
we're gonna see the he'll be placed on

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.430 
we're gonna see the he'll be placed on
the<00:02:03.360> hold<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.770> he'll<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.690> my<00:02:06.930> weight<00:02:07.170> is

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the hold so he'll on all of my weight is
