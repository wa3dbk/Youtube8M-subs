00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.650
 finally with a new tutorial I do 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.959
 spend some time because unfortunately 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.800
 I have little time and this tutorial is a bit 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:24.150
 I don't know how we want it 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 call it photo with hole or photo 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 together movement this is the effect e 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 I explain to you how to do it we open the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.060
 our photoshop 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.520
 we have a photo of our choice 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.620
 jennifer connely if we take it off 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 background and so always keep one 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.320
 background published if in the case we have 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.950
 need we take hold of ours 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 circle and from here we do a nice 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.090
 circle on our photo we put ourselves 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 sky we position hair prisms 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.060
 let's go on reverse selection so that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.850
 we don't give the effect to the background or not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.970
 we give it inside our photo 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:17.180
 let's go to blur filter blur 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:22.979
 radial here we decide to give it a zoom 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.080
 is the factor we go to eye we see a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 50 percent 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.700
 we load it as you already see 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 we have 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.840
 this background so already a means 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.900
 movement sees and while the image 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.350
 central and firm or take the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.689
 radial nuance and as a first color 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.049
 plan 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:53.549
 let's put a dark blue and take that one 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.540
 with the circle is the second one then 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.939
 that goes from the blue to take on transparent the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.369
 we give ok we throw it in as you see 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:12.730
 we gave this another one 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:16.000
 reverse level selection track 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.180
 edit trace we give a thickness of 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.360
 5 a white color so we give it a 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.260
 track central location and method of 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:33.109
 we give normal fusion 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.170
 ok as you can see we already have this 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:40.489
 effect that is of this circle that makes 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.310
 catch a glimpse of the rest of the body 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.150
 now that we do take this 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.959
 level of nuance let's go up 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.519
 We talk a bit about saturation 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:06.200
 the color volume a little so let's go 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:09.409
 on the blend method overlay color 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:15.459
 here is how you see we have this effect 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:21.319
 of movement of photos while this is more 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:24.739
 sharp let's go to the track level 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:28.639
 let's go to the outside shadow we put them 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:35.239
 an outer shadow so that you see 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:41.659
 better extension and inner shadow e 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:45.650
 also I find the relief new 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:52.849
 level we make another circle 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:04:01.750
 we do it a little manual if it is 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:01.750
 we move it we fill it with brown 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:16.169
 the blend method discolours as you see 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:20.850
 looks like a magnifying glass on one 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.700
 photos of you vol title with this the 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.990
 our affection is over I hope there is 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.700
 liked and see you at the next 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.700
 tutorial hi guys
