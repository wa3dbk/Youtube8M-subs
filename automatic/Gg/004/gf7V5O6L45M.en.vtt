together and really hit it hard today is
a<00:00:27.840> tough<00:00:28.290> workout<00:00:28.590> I'm<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.460> excited<00:00:29.820> she

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
a tough workout I'm really excited she

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.440 
a tough workout I'm really excited she
planned<00:00:30.360> it<00:00:30.480> yeah<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.980> could<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.430> bad<00:00:32.579> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
planned it yeah this could be bad so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940 
planned it yeah this could be bad so
what<00:00:33.600> we're<00:00:33.720> going<00:00:33.810> to<00:00:33.900> do<00:00:33.990> today<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.530> little

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
what we're going to do today is a little

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.370 
what we're going to do today is a little
bit<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> hit<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.790> bit<00:00:35.970> of<00:00:36.380> plyometrics

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
bit of hit a little bit of plyometrics

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.600 
bit of hit a little bit of plyometrics
so<00:00:37.590> high<00:00:37.770> intensity<00:00:38.220> interval<00:00:38.250> training

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so high intensity interval training

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.390 
so high intensity interval training
really<00:00:39.510> jack<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> heart<00:00:40.290> rate<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> burn<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
really jack up the heart rate and burn a

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.130 
really jack up the heart rate and burn a
ton<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> calories<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.540> we've<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.870> three

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
ton of calories so we've got three

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
ton of calories so we've got three
separate<00:00:43.650> circuits<00:00:44.130> that<00:00:44.220> we're<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> do

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
separate circuits that we're going to do

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
separate circuits that we're going to do
three<00:00:45.120> exercises<00:00:45.350> per<00:00:46.350> circuit<00:00:46.649> each

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
three exercises per circuit each

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
three exercises per circuit each
exercise<00:00:47.969> within<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> circuit<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.140> 60

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
exercise within the circuit is 60

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
exercise within the circuit is 60
seconds<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.309> 20<00:00:50.760> seconds<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.329> rest<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.100> we're

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
seconds with 20 seconds of rest so we're

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.139 
seconds with 20 seconds of rest so we're
going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.399> through<00:00:53.609> each<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.000> those<00:00:54.090> three

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
going to go through each of those three

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.500 
going to go through each of those three
times<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:56.039> gonna<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.399> lot<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> fun<00:00:56.850> why

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
times and it's gonna be a lot of fun why

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
times and it's gonna be a lot of fun why
don't<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> explain<00:00:57.809> about<00:00:58.109> hit<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.949> BIOS<00:00:59.519> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
don't you explain about hit and BIOS and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
don't you explain about hit and BIOS and
why<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> crazy<00:01:00.690> stuff<00:01:00.809> yeah<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
get on the treadmill go forever at a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.590 
get on the treadmill go forever at a
steady<00:01:05.489> state<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.150> doesn't<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> lot

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
steady state and that doesn't do a lot

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
steady state and that doesn't do a lot
for<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> conditioning<00:01:07.410> of<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.590> body<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.130> we

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
for the conditioning of your body so we

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
for the conditioning of your body so we
do<00:01:08.400> commissioning<00:01:09.240> jacks<00:01:09.690> your<00:01:09.840> heart<00:01:09.990> rate

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
do commissioning jacks your heart rate

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
do commissioning jacks your heart rate
up<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.440> able<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> furnish<00:01:10.800> automatic<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
up you're able to furnish automatic a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
up you're able to furnish automatic a
lot<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.820> matta<00:01:12.000> calories<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.540> short<00:01:12.900> period<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
lot of matta calories in short period of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.540 
lot of matta calories in short period of
time<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.980> also<00:01:14.100> brings<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
time and it also brings in the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.460 
time and it also brings in the
conditioning<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> line<00:01:15.390> legs<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> ABS

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470

midsection<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.250> stuff<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
midsection and stuff like that so we

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.700 
midsection and stuff like that so we
like<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> mix<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.229> bit<00:01:19.409> between

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
like to mix it up a little bit between

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
like to mix it up a little bit between
steady-state<00:01:20.070> hit<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.030> tell<00:01:21.210> Victoria

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
steady-state hit and I tell Victoria

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.030 
steady-state hit and I tell Victoria
she's<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.380> maximuscle<00:01:22.860> today

she's gonna be at maximuscle today

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.230 
she's gonna be at maximuscle today
making<00:01:23.280> appearance<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.729> she's<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.030> lean
