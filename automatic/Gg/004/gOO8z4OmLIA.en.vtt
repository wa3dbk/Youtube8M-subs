00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.329
 Hello again 

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.000
 this time he tells you about an experience in my life as a gamer 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.840
 playing xbox 360 and wii future ps3 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.879
 I'll tell you why it was and I repeat I was in love with the nintendo wii but 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.800
 now I realize that it is the biggest garbage in terms of consoles of this 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.630
 generation 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.730
 1 I start to tell you 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.330
 some time ago I had an xbox 360 which amused me the most 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 gears of war colotto and uti etcetera I spent my days playing with my cousins 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.329
 without getting tired because I had really cool games but a year 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 the red lights came out 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.930
 and next Christmas they bought me a wii and I really want to take advantage of it 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.390
 that my fun moments come back like with my xbox 360 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.530
 At the beginning, the Wii excited me a lot because I thought I was going to go back 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.810
 playing excellent games but ended up disappointing me 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.260
 he saw that his best games did not go beyond mario mario this mario the other mario 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.780
 mario and so on 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.530
 his graphics were very heavy 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.110
 most of its catalog of games will be childish and mediocre 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 I did not have such good games for the other consoles 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 his way of playing that was strange and always different 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.040
 I always try to see him on the positive side, but he did not succeed 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.770
 for all those reasons or that the wii was not the console that the xbox wanted 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.270
 360 yes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.310
 but it tied me to his many mistakes 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.430
 your internet charge and its great overheating and noise 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.050
 and because I did not notice before 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.050
 the ps3 is the perfect console for me 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.690
 is the most powerful console with the best technology and graphics 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.890
 brutally incredible, far superior to the other consoles 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.080
 has blu-ray format with hd quality that will soon surpass tenerife 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.770
 its controls are comfortable and with motion sensor in front and back 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.270
 sides 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.540
 and you do not need to be buying in batteries as it comes with a special charger 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.539
 included that is connected by means of which it is seen 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.070
 its internet connectivity better called playstation network which is just like the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.330
 xbox the ihf but this one is cool and fadi free and excellent 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 great exclusive games like killzone 2 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.090
 lit the vi plan net 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.209
 rodolfo al 3 metal gear solid 4 gran turismo 5 et cetera 6 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.829
 its accessory called playstation mus that detects the movements 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.189
 I must admit it is a copy of the wii command only that this is much better 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.630
 since it captures movements more accurately you do not need to be buying 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.420
 batteries are 100% wireless and with much higher graphics and good games 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.839
 you can use it as a cd u for an operating system like linux 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.829
 so all of you I recommend 100% the ps3 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.640
 of preferential clean that this has no defect is a work 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.040
 teacher and I hope to sell my wii crap to soon have that majestic 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.659
 console 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.870
 thank you, see you soon
