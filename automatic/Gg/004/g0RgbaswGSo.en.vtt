00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
I would look I would look so stupid if I

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.020 
I would look I would look so stupid if I
didn't<00:01:28.280> take<00:01:28.909> any<00:01:29.180> anyway<00:01:29.509> but<00:01:30.200> look<00:01:31.720> see<00:01:32.720> I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
didn't take any anyway but look see I

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.469 
didn't take any anyway but look see I
didn't<00:01:35.030> bounce<00:01:35.240> as<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.259> right<00:01:36.530> there

didn't bounce as it is right there

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
didn't bounce as it is right there
and<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.600> got<00:01:38.780> screwed<00:01:39.140> over

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.170
