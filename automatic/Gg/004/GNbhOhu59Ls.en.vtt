00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 today my base is simply from 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.730
 first in all the mobile eyelid either 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 above that is a bit of concealer 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.400
 because i'm not good about the cycle for not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 make the eye shadow stick already 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:25.109
 first start by putting this make 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.210
 up orange and start by putting a 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.300
 little bit of clear light clear genius 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.550
 clear light clear little touch the little 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.850
 puff brush to remove access 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.440
 at 1 slightly below the eyebrows 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 that at this point there is no primer 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.329
 so what you are alone is maximum 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.329
 giallino is a smaller brush 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.190
 make the inside of the eye 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 can't even below 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.870
 I don't have orange so now I have it 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.430
 I'll have to do it in layers and to do it if a 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.970
 nice day and fast throughout the part 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.970
 mobile eyelid 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.080
 but let's get back a little bit below 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.460
 but with a fairly soft brush 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.270
 I repeat, the orange does not sky then 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.650
 I have to make it I take this red 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.960
 which goes slightly on the shade 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.190
 of orange and I pass it by half 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 eyelid then trying to fade it is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.690
 as possible with the yellow we have 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.870
 put under for having just a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.070
 Orange 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.720
 obviously if you are lucky enough to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 you do n't have it ready now if there is 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.280
 comfortable band because that's enough you do 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.050
 the first the first half of the eyelid 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.310
 only with yellow is for the second goal 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.480
 with orange lightly blend the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.260
 cut to taking it counted 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.390
 cousin also down to half 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.270
 of the eye so it will come darker where 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.490
 the yellow has not arrived is lighter 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.100
 where instead there is yellow with others 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:34.160
 panels we can no longer take small 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.900
 always this orange red zoe is in 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.560
 let's scroll the shadow line 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.560
 eye 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.010
 always has the same brush is 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.530
 always with this red pass it a little 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 even inside the eye where 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.480
 we put the garden lighter 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.790
 I'm a bit sorry for the noises of 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.670
 background but I have the window open 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:19.180
 it's hot and all the noises come in 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:23.410
 cars and motorcycles that can 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.769
 same brush we are going to take a 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.440
 pinch of this here which is a yellow 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.860
 a little stronger and is slightly for 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.860
 the car 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.420
 we swab the strip to do 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.570
 become orange right where we have it 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.910
 put the red is unloading the 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.830
 camera so it will be a very fast one 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.830
 thin eyeliner below 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.470
 remember when it comes from the nar 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.980
 yes to pass the mascara immediately otherwise 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.459
 it gets all a bit of traffic is one 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.829
 also ultra-thin line 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.829
 above when center 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.540
 abundant mascolo 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.990
 it is known as clear, curious first 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:02.600
 I put this on a doll type and then 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.100
 it's not a little darker 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.710
 the compound that gave us hunt one 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.710
 pink is transparent glitter 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.120
 that's the finished trick maybe 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.670
 always prefer you can put a 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.670
 peach-colored lipstick
