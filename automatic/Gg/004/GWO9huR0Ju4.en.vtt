00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello and welcome to this course for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 learn to knit online in this chapter 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.490
 Chapter 11 we will learn to do 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.640
 Eights or braids 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.160
 the base of the braids is a technique 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.250
 very simple in which the points are 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.880
 intersect on a group of points of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.410
 the same turn to cross them 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.660
 we will use a special needle 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.530
 braids or a safety pin that you'll see 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.570
 in this video later 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.620
 to make the sample that I have made 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.790
 for this video I have drawn a pattern 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 this pattern consists of the return of the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.949
 right to work we start with two 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.640
 points of the right then five points 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:59.229
 upside down six points of the right that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.680
 it will be the first braid then four 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.080
 points of the reverse and six points of the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.250
 right that will be the second braid 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.789
 followed by five points of the reverse and two 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.789
 of the right 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.420
 braids usually carry both 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.090
 reverse points sides is to say yes 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.080
 We are doing the braid with points 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.510
 of the right on both sides of it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.860
 we're going to make upside-down points so that 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.860
 the braid highlights more 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.650
 until here we will be knitting points of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.850
 law and purl stitches under 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.850
 pattern that we have 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.259
 ah 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.670
 when we have the right to work 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.149
 done let's change the hand needle and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.369
 start the reverse of the work the reverse 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.700
 of the work will go with points 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.200
 contrary to the right of the work is 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 say if we had 5 points 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.190
 to one side of the braid backwards now 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.890
 let's make points of law and in the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.560
 same braid that we had woven before 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.739
 for the right to work points of 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.739
 right let's make upside-down points 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.820
 we will have to knit the points that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.300
 correspond to us 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.300
 every time 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.770
 when we have already done all the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.740
 turns of points as we want the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.430
 width of the braid we will make the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.180
 crossing that is what makes that 8 effect 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.180
 or braid 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.760
 we knit the stitches as usual or 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.940
 as the pattern comes and when 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.970
 get to the points where we go 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.680
 to make the braid we are going to use the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.519
 safety pin 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.519
 sting but 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.629
 this safety pin is special for wool 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.930
 let's take the three points you see 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:34.319
 in the video once we pick them up 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.700
 We leave on hold and we will knit with 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.870
 points of the right the other three points 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.870
 that we have left of the braid 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.600
 once we are weaving we will go back to 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.450
 incorporate the points we had in 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.450
 wait or in the safety pin to the needle 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.370
 we turn them over as we had it in the 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.770
 unmissable and we weave them with points of 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.770
 right as we are entitled 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.070
 these crosses are always going to 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.320
 perform in the return of the right of the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.050
 work 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.290
 and we will put as many laps as 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.770
 We want wide braids or 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.770
 eights 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.240
 once we get to the second braid 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.820
 of the tissue we are going to repeat the process 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.880
 with the safety pin we will take the three 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.289
 first points and we are going to put them in 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.499
 wait 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.990
 and we weave the three following points with 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:08.330
 points of the right since we are in the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.900
 return of the right of labor 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.900
 then we dump the points as they are 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:33.280
 and we weave them as normally in this 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.280
 case correspond to points of law 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.400
 in the reverse of the work we are going to weave 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.070
 the points that correspond 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.490
 that is, we had done points before 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.840
 of right now in this round you 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.240
 we will make points inside out and in the braid 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.980
 we will do the same thing, that is, weave the 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.720
 points upside down as normally as 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.720
 if there was not a crossing 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.220
 when we have already gone around 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.490
 corresponding to the width that we want 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.240
 the braids we will perform the same 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.060
 process of crossing and we will take with the 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.300
 unmissable three points 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:38.790
 we work from the right the rest of the 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.790
 three points that remain in the tissue 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.380
 then we turn over the points we have in 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.639
 the safety pin and we're going to weave them with 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.639
 points of the right 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.710
 all right 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.249
 in the blog I leave the pattern of this 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:31.360
