i'm going to show you where the two

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
i'm going to show you where the two
portals<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.790> complete<00:02:03.180> take<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
portals that are complete take me in the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.900 
portals that are complete take me in the
real<00:02:04.590> world<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:05.750> still<00:02:06.750> haven't<00:02:06.960> gotten<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
real world I still haven't gotten to a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.530 
real world I still haven't gotten to a
cold<00:02:09.110> biome<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.410> snow<00:02:11.270> that's<00:02:12.270> why<00:02:12.480> i'm

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
cold biome that has snow that's why i'm

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
cold biome that has snow that's why i'm
building<00:02:12.630> own<00:02:12.959> leads<00:02:13.080> portal<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.590> i<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.800> try

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
building own leads portal so i can try

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.330 
building own leads portal so i can try
to<00:02:13.980> find<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> cold<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.790> biome<00:02:15.360> where<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:16.340> find

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to find a cold on biome where I can find

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.490 
to find a cold on biome where I can find
pumpkins<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.959> get<00:02:19.650> snow<00:02:20.190> um<00:02:21.319> there<00:02:22.319> was<00:02:22.440> a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
pumpkins and get snow um there was a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.809 
pumpkins and get snow um there was a
bunch<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.830> trees<00:02:23.100> here<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.459> just<00:02:23.610> kind<00:02:23.790> of

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
bunch of trees here and I just kind of

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.750 
bunch of trees here and I just kind of
burnt<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.209> down<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:26.160> still<00:02:26.640> get

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
burnt them down so that I can still get

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.949 
burnt them down so that I can still get
the<00:02:26.850> woods<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.269> there's<00:02:27.480> none<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.780> leaf

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
the woods but there's none of the leaf

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.550 
the woods but there's none of the leaf
everywhere<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.560> explored

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
everywhere and this one I explored

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.990 
everywhere and this one I explored
around<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.100> there's<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.340> few<00:02:32.519> caves<00:02:32.730> but

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
around it there's a few caves but

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.199 
around it there's a few caves but
they're<00:02:33.150> really<00:02:33.269> small<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:35.700> all<00:02:36.000> this

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
they're really small and it's all this

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.350 
they're really small and it's all this
type<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> ion<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.989> grassy<00:02:37.530> hills<00:02:37.769> no<00:02:38.730> snow

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
type of ion like grassy hills no snow

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.530 
type of ion like grassy hills no snow
yet<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.340> far<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.420> only

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
yet and so far I think that you can only

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.229 
yet and so far I think that you can only
find<00:02:42.750> pumpkins<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.769> snow<00:02:44.160> biome<00:02:44.400> biomes

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
find pumpkins in this snow biome biomes

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.500 
find pumpkins in this snow biome biomes
because<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.600> haven't<00:02:45.780> found<00:02:45.989> any<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:47.510> other

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
because I haven't found any in other

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.940 
because I haven't found any in other
places<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:52.080> I'll<00:02:52.230> take<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.830> other

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
places so now I'll take you to the other

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.770 
places so now I'll take you to the other
portal

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.559 

only<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.620> looks<00:02:59.890> good<00:03:02.940> these<00:03:03.940> um<00:03:04.410> sky

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
only that looks good these um sky

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.030 
only that looks good these um sky
bridges<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:07.810> guess<00:03:07.990> they<00:03:08.650> didn't<00:03:08.860> take<00:03:08.980> very

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
bridges I guess they didn't take very

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.730 
bridges I guess they didn't take very
long<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> build<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.990> held<00:03:11.200> shift<00:03:11.500> and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
long to build I just held shift and

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.820 
long to build I just held shift and
edged<00:03:11.890> off<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:12.459> kept<00:03:13.530> looking<00:03:14.530> like

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
edged off and just kept looking like

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.500 
edged off and just kept looking like
that<00:03:17.220> I'll<00:03:18.220> probably<00:03:18.459> make<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.730> walls<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.360> them

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
that I'll probably make a walls on them

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.850 
that I'll probably make a walls on them
at<00:03:19.569> some<00:03:19.750> point<00:03:19.780> but<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:20.410> haven't<00:03:20.590> done<00:03:20.739> it

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
at some point but I just haven't done it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.890 
at some point but I just haven't done it
yet<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.280> need<00:03:21.880> two<00:03:22.030> more<00:03:22.180> upsetting<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.690> stick

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
yet I need two more upsetting to stick

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.330 
yet I need two more upsetting to stick
right<00:03:23.080> there<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.500> then<00:03:23.590> I'll<00:03:23.739> have<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.890> portal

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
right there and then I'll have a portal

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.380 
right there and then I'll have a portal
right<00:03:24.370> here<00:03:25.980> which<00:03:26.980> will<00:03:27.280> hopefully<00:03:27.880> lead<00:03:28.360> to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
right here which will hopefully lead to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.240 
right here which will hopefully lead to
a<00:03:29.040> cold<00:03:30.040> biome<00:03:30.459> with<00:03:30.640> snow<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:35.560> plan<00:03:35.830> not

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
a cold biome with snow and I plan not

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.880 
a cold biome with snow and I plan not
because<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.519> have<00:03:36.670> um<00:03:37.590> collected<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.680> ton<00:03:38.860> of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
because I have um collected a ton of

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.160 
because I have um collected a ton of
this<00:03:39.130> redstone<00:03:39.450> there's<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.540> red<00:03:40.780> stuff<00:03:40.930> I

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
this redstone there's this red stuff I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.650 
this redstone there's this red stuff I
don't<00:03:41.320> really<00:03:41.440> know<00:03:41.620> what<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.950> call<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.660> have

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
don't really know what to call it I have

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.440 
don't really know what to call it I have
planned<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.230> make<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.410> huge<00:03:44.890> castle<00:03:45.640> either<00:03:46.209> on

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
planned to make a huge castle either on

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.100 
planned to make a huge castle either on
the<00:03:46.540> main<00:03:46.750> world<00:03:46.959> or<00:03:47.290> oops<00:03:48.069> fuck<00:03:48.930> either<00:03:49.930> in

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
the main world or oops fuck either in

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
the main world or in hell I plan to make

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.910 
the main world or in hell I plan to make
a<00:03:52.360> huge<00:03:52.690> castle<00:03:52.930> with<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.380> it'll<00:03:53.530> probably<00:03:53.709> be

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
a huge castle with it it'll probably be

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.280 
a huge castle with it it'll probably be
not<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.519> held<00:03:54.819> in<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.510> nether<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.930> don't<00:03:56.200> know

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
not in held in the nether I don't know

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.500 
not in held in the nether I don't know
why<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.470> always<00:03:56.530> called<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.390> lot

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
why I always called that just a lot

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.640 
why I always called that just a lot
easier<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.840> say<00:04:00.420> yeah<00:04:01.420> but<00:04:01.600> I'll<00:04:01.750> I'm<00:04:02.380> probably

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
easier to say yeah but I'll I'm probably

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.440 
easier to say yeah but I'll I'm probably
not<00:04:02.799> gonna<00:04:02.890> make<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:04.000> nether<00:04:04.209> i'll

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
not gonna make it in the nether i'll

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.789 
not gonna make it in the nether i'll
probably<00:04:04.690> make<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.380> main<00:04:05.530> surface

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
probably make it on the main surface

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.090 
probably make it on the main surface
just<00:04:06.310> because<00:04:07.410> you'll<00:04:08.410> you'll<00:04:08.799> be<00:04:08.920> able<00:04:09.010> to

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:51.649 
I think I might have dug that and then

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:52.959 
I think I might have dug that and then
this<00:04:51.829> is<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.009> other<00:04:52.189> portal<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:52.789> one
