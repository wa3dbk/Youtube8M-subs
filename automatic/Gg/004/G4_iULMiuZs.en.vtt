00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 I remember absolutely everything related to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.970
 olympic games because it's 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.589
 always had the biggest goal itself 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.250
 more motivation throughout my 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.920
 careers 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.340
 of course never forget my first 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.039
 performance this was 1000 year australia 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.390
 and I was very sad because when 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.930
 we came to the Olympic Village and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.550
 opened the booklet it was written that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.619
 from athletics, we expect so much 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 there are so many medals there 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.150
 abstracts unfortunately nothing for me 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.859
 somehow this is how it hurt me 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.450
 was eighteen years old i was just starting 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.710
 my professional way on me is very 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.329
 I wanted to win a medal for my 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.600
 countries and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.550
 it became so good to me 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 good motivation but everything is not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 evolved, I now remember that since 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 first match I broke racket 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.320
 then there were problems with countries on 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 the third match I do there is one 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.309
 paladins on i'm a pair of sneakers and and which 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.199
 there the sole fell off all the time I 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.149
 she said that probably not destiny that's all 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.640
 Iâ€™m talking about identity 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.350
 will not work well, here's how it's probably 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 enthusiasm about lada 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.990
 great desire it all came together and i 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.880
 played her first final of indian names 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 this silver medal and she for me 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.430
 was worth its weight in gold and there you are from i'm not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.530
 you have just passed the first olympiad 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.780
 insulting and vexing and defeat in athens on 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 next olympia tackle chatting games 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.830
 there would be no ewok victory historical 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.659
 when for the first time on a pedestal there were three 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.610
 Russian women but in fact after 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.409
 beijing finals that we played on 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.479
 Nara sateen and the first question that we 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.640
 asked how the faith of zvonareva played 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.689
 because it all happened 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 certain circumstances 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.530
 schedule we played at the same time and match 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.479
 for gold and for bronze we are right 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.369
 maps and we were worried only one question 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.049
 of course we wanted to stand together and 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.789
 when we learned that yes it seems to me 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.140
 despite even disappointing dinar 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.330
 naturally can and understand after 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.729
 defeat anyway there was pride in 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.259
 your country and what happened and how 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.259
 then here we are a part
