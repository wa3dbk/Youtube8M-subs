00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
fruit spurs where your apples will be

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
about 2 inches above the lateral

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.820 
about 2 inches above the lateral
branching<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.720> with<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:22.020> pair<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> sharp

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
branching and with a nice pair of sharp

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.870 
branching and with a nice pair of sharp
hand<00:01:23.630> pruners<00:01:24.630> come<00:01:25.530> right<00:01:25.740> above<00:01:26.100> 2<00:01:26.430> inches

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
hand pruners come right above 2 inches

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.560 
hand pruners come right above 2 inches
and<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.570> prune<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> branches<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.619> off

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
and just prune the branches right off

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.310 
and just prune the branches right off
this<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:31.340> keeps<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.579> plant<00:01:33.320> looking

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this also keeps your plant looking

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.270 
this also keeps your plant looking
healthy<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:36.770> creates<00:01:37.770> quite<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.479> an

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
healthy and creates quite a an

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.350 
healthy and creates quite a an
opportunity<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> fruit<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.119> some

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
opportunity for the fruit to get some

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.810 
opportunity for the fruit to get some
sunlight

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
sunlight

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.980 
sunlight
we<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.990> mention<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.950> prune<00:01:47.250> our

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
we like mention we will prune our

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.060 
we like mention we will prune our
espaliers<00:01:49.939> several<00:01:50.939> times<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.450> year<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.930> that

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
espaliers several times a year and that

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
espaliers several times a year and that
is<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.520> keep<00:01:53.909> our<00:01:54.119> caliper<00:01:54.540> high

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
is so that we can keep our caliper high

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.740 
is so that we can keep our caliper high
and<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:56.009> also<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.729> provide<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.479> bit<00:01:57.600> of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and we also can provide a little bit of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.609 
and we also can provide a little bit of
sunlight<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.500> apples<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.409> see

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
sunlight for the apples so you can see

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.940 
sunlight for the apples so you can see
here<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.450> these<00:02:03.450> apple<00:02:03.930> trees<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.229> ready<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
here this these apple trees are ready to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.419 
here this these apple trees are ready to
be<00:02:05.130> pruned<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.220> look
