lens is a lot of people ask us what
they're<00:00:15.690> all<00:00:15.839> about<00:00:15.870> why<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> need<00:00:16.770> those

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
they're all about why you need those

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.849 
they're all about why you need those
movements<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> today<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
most people associate tilt shift lens is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.509 
most people associate tilt shift lens is
with<00:00:24.330> architectural<00:00:25.170> work<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:26.160> really

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
with architectural work but really

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
with architectural work but really
they're<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.000> very<00:00:27.480> very<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.960> home<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
they're very very very at home in the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.500 
they're very very very at home in the
studio<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.460> they<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.699> save<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.939> hours<00:00:30.179> of

studio and they can save you hours of
time<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.439> polish<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.070> images<00:00:32.489> not

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
time and really polish your images not

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.270 
time and really polish your images not
only<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.210> creatively<00:00:33.989> extending<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:34.739> reducing

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
only in creatively extending or reducing

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
only in creatively extending or reducing
your<00:00:35.430> depth<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.790> field<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.300> also<00:00:36.840> keeping

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
your depth of field but also keeping

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.340 
your depth of field but also keeping
things<00:00:37.730> geometrically<00:00:38.730> correct<00:00:39.350> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
things geometrically correct this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.130 
things geometrically correct this
particular<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:41.280> shot<00:00:41.600> it's<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> basic

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
particular little shot it's just a basic

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.290 
particular little shot it's just a basic
pack<00:00:44.070> shot<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:46.170> quickly<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.710> can

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
pack shot really but very quickly we can

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
pack shot really but very quickly we can
produce<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.570> much<00:00:48.750> higher<00:00:48.989> quality<00:00:49.559> image<00:00:49.890> just

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
produce a much higher quality image just

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
produce a much higher quality image just
by<00:00:50.610> playing<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.120> camera<00:00:51.539> movements<00:00:52.190> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
by playing with camera movements so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
by playing with camera movements so
we're<00:00:53.309> using<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.640> tilt<00:00:53.940> shift<00:00:54.000> lens<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.660> show

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
we're using this tilt shift lens to show

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.099 
we're using this tilt shift lens to show
how<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:56.219> extend<00:00:56.460> our<00:00:56.730> depth<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.120> field<00:00:57.360> we

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
how we can extend our depth of field we

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.900 
how we can extend our depth of field we
are<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.620> shooting<00:00:58.949> wide<00:00:59.160> opens<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.699> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
are we're shooting wide opens on this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
are we're shooting wide opens on this
lens<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.600> 50<00:01:00.930> mil<00:01:01.140> Shinoda

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
lens this is the 50 mil Shinoda

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
lens this is the 50 mil Shinoda
tilt-shift<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:02.969> 2.8<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:04.019> i<00:01:04.140> use

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
tilt-shift we are at 2.8 and if i use

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.960 
tilt-shift we are at 2.8 and if i use
the<00:01:04.530> live<00:01:04.769> view<00:01:04.979> function<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> back<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the live view function on the back of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
the live view function on the back of
the<00:01:06.049> d7000<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:09.380> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.409> zero

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the d7000 we can see that which is zero

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
the d7000 we can see that which is zero
everything<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
everything first so we can see if I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.210 
everything first so we can see if I
focus<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.830> lens<00:01:15.590> with<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> tip<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> tape

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
focus the lens with the tip of the tape

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.010 
focus the lens with the tip of the tape
measure<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> nice<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> sharp<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.900> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
measure is nice and sharp and then if I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.460 
measure is nice and sharp and then if I
scroll<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.590> burning<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.610> 100%

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
scroll up burning one that I'm at 100%

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.990 
scroll up burning one that I'm at 100%
we<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.890> everything<00:01:23.130> drifts<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
we can see that everything drifts out of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
we can see that everything drifts out of
focus<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.350> shoot<00:01:25.530> wide

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
focus so we know that if we shoot wide

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
focus so we know that if we shoot wide
open<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.580> lens<00:01:26.820> we're<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> have

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
open with this lens we're going to have

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.950 
open with this lens we're going to have
very<00:01:28.320> narrow<00:01:28.590> depth<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.040> field<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.210> take<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
very narrow depth of field if I take it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380 
very narrow depth of field if I take it
back<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.670> end<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> table

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
back so we can see the end of the table

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.710 
back so we can see the end of the table
all<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:36.360> i<00:01:36.450> zoom

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
all the way back here but then i zoom

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.289 
all the way back here but then i zoom
back<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.079> again<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> put

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
back in again and then I'm going to put

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
back in again and then I'm going to put
just<00:01:39.570> front<00:01:40.049> tilt<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just front tilt and I'm not going to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.910 
just front tilt and I'm not going to
touch<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.549> focus<00:01:41.880> control<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.720> front<00:01:43.049> tilt

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.319 

very<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.399> focused

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
very one that I focused

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.410 
very one that I focused
vaguely<00:01:48.630> first<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> tip<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> tape<00:01:50.420> I'm

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
vaguely first or the tip of the tape I'm

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
vaguely first or the tip of the tape I'm
not<00:01:51.810> focusing<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.799> such<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.850> putting<00:01:54.240> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
not focusing as such I'm just putting in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.289 
not focusing as such I'm just putting in
front<00:01:54.720> till<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
front till and you can see that this

back to the front section we can see

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.530 
back to the front section we can see
that<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> minor<00:02:12.030> minor<00:02:12.390> tweak

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
I can assure that tip very sharp go back

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:23.580 
I can assure that tip very sharp go back
again<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:22.030> with<00:02:22.359> a<00:02:22.390> slight<00:02:23.049> tweak<00:02:23.379> of

tilt<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:29.159> can<00:02:30.159> ensure<00:02:30.340> will<00:02:30.730> have<00:02:30.939> sharpness

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
clearly from front to back and we're

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.940 
clearly from front to back and we're
doing<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:34.689> maximum<00:02:35.470> aperture<00:02:35.829> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
doing that at maximum aperture the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
doing that at maximum aperture the
advantage<00:02:36.459> with<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.939> we<00:02:37.120> can<00:02:37.329> use<00:02:37.689> our

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
advantage with that is we can use our

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.599 
advantage with that is we can use our

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
depth of field you tend to stop the lens

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.390 
depth of field you tend to stop the lens
down<00:02:48.549> far<00:02:49.120> too<00:02:49.420> much<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.620> sweet<00:02:50.920> spot<00:02:51.189> of<00:02:51.280> this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
down far too much the sweet spot of this

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.640 
down far too much the sweet spot of this
particular<00:02:51.669> lens<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.540> 50<00:02:52.959> mil<00:02:53.169> is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
particular lens this is the 50 mil is

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.009 
particular lens this is the 50 mil is
probably<00:02:54.069> around<00:02:54.370> about<00:02:54.599> f11<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.750> will<00:02:55.870> give

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
probably around about f11 that will give

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.960 
probably around about f11 that will give
us<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.230> best<00:02:56.470> compromise<00:02:56.799> between<00:02:57.220> depth<00:02:57.730> of

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
us the best compromise between depth of

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.899 
us the best compromise between depth of
field<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.629> resolution<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.919> don't<00:03:00.189> suffer

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
field and resolution so we don't suffer

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.000 
field and resolution so we don't suffer
adverse<00:03:01.620> effects<00:03:02.620> from<00:03:02.849> diffraction<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:05.010> it's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
adverse effects from diffraction so it's

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.199 
adverse effects from diffraction so it's
a<00:03:06.129> really<00:03:06.489> nice<00:03:06.669> easy<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:09.370> control<00:03:09.790> effect

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
a really nice easy to to control effect

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.690 
a really nice easy to to control effect
if<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:11.139> try<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.470> do<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.829> same<00:03:12.099> thing<00:03:12.489> just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
if I try to do the same thing just

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.390 
if I try to do the same thing just
simply<00:03:13.389> by<00:03:13.540> stopping<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.169> down<00:03:14.409> it<00:03:15.129> would

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
simply by stopping it down it would

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.460 
simply by stopping it down it would
still<00:03:15.790> drift<00:03:16.239> out<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.510> focus<00:03:17.049> very<00:03:17.200> very

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
still drift out of focus very very

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.259 
still drift out of focus very very
clearly<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.069> we<00:03:18.729> would<00:03:18.909> suffer<00:03:19.239> from

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
clearly and we would suffer from

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.909 
clearly and we would suffer from
diffraction<00:03:19.959> because<00:03:20.199> I'd<00:03:20.319> be<00:03:20.470> tempted<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
diffraction because I'd be tempted to

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.460 
diffraction because I'd be tempted to
stop<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.370> down<00:03:21.489> past<00:03:21.790> f11<00:03:22.599> even<00:03:23.169> though<00:03:23.290> this

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
stop it down past f11 even though this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.080 
stop it down past f11 even though this
lens<00:03:23.709> will<00:03:23.919> stop<00:03:24.159> down<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.549> 32<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:27.310> far<00:03:27.760> far

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
lens will stop down to 32 it's far far

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
lens will stop down to 32 it's far far
better<00:03:28.419> to<00:03:28.780> use<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.049> at<00:03:29.319> its<00:03:29.500> optimum

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
better to use it at its optimum

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.420 
better to use it at its optimum
apertures<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:32.139> this<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> typical<00:03:33.069> sort<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
apertures so this is a typical sort of

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.420 
apertures so this is a typical sort of
shot<00:03:33.699> that<00:03:34.319> can<00:03:35.319> cause<00:03:35.560> people<00:03:35.769> problems<00:03:36.280> in

shot that can cause people problems in

shot that can cause people problems in
the<00:03:36.519> studio<00:03:36.909> no<00:03:37.090> it's<00:03:37.239> exactly<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.079> same<00:03:38.260> sort

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the studio no it's exactly the same sort

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.869 
the studio no it's exactly the same sort
of<00:03:38.530> problem<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:38.979> you'd<00:03:39.099> get<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.639> you're

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
of problem that you'd get if you're

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.819 
of problem that you'd get if you're
taking<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.269> picture<00:03:40.419> of<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.659> building<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.650> can

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
taking a picture of a building you can

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.309 
taking a picture of a building you can

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
see that this box is actually leaning in

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.640 
see that this box is actually leaning in
at<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.099> top<00:03:45.419> so<00:03:46.419> just<00:03:46.750> sort<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:46.959> here<00:03:47.229> and<00:03:47.440> here

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
at the top so just sort of here and here

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.649 
at the top so just sort of here and here
the<00:03:47.829> same<00:03:47.859> thing<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.549> if<00:03:48.669> you<00:03:49.030> shot<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.329> picture

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
the same thing is if you shot a picture

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.390 
the same thing is if you shot a picture

the<00:03:56.109> things<00:03:56.349> that<00:03:56.560> made<00:03:56.799> 5x4<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.909> attractive

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
the things that made 5x4 so attractive

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.569 
the things that made 5x4 so attractive
was<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.139> fact<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.439> had<00:03:59.620> control<00:04:00.129> over

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
was the fact you had control over

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.899 
was the fact you had control over
perspective<00:04:01.479> so<00:04:02.319> that<00:04:02.620> we<00:04:03.129> can<00:04:03.400> if<00:04:03.549> we<00:04:03.579> were<00:04:03.790> to

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
perspective so that we can if we were to

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.309 
perspective so that we can if we were to
just<00:04:04.030> level<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.569> up<00:04:04.750> as<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.989> nice<00:04:05.169> little

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
just level this up as a nice little

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.729 
just level this up as a nice little
spirit<00:04:05.680> level<00:04:05.709> on<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.250> top<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.959> this<00:04:08.290> tripod

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739

spirit level on the top of this tripod
head<00:04:08.979> I<00:04:09.479> can<00:04:10.479> use<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.079> front<00:04:11.470> rise<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.609> fall

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
head I can use the front rise and fall

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.759 
head I can use the front rise and fall
mechanism<00:04:13.389> I'm<00:04:13.750> actually<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.199> use<00:04:14.379> full

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
mechanism I'm actually going to use full

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.620 
mechanism I'm actually going to use full
if<00:04:15.129> a<00:04:15.310> rebuilding<00:04:15.639> we'd<00:04:15.939> normally<00:04:16.090> use<00:04:16.359> rise

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
if a rebuilding we'd normally use rise

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.129 
if a rebuilding we'd normally use rise
and<00:04:17.109> I'm<00:04:17.349> going<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.620> lower<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:19.060> front<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.690> you

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
and I'm going to lower the front and you

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.589 
and I'm going to lower the front and you
can<00:04:20.169> see<00:04:20.320> hopefully<00:04:21.159> then<00:04:22.120> what<00:04:22.300> we're<00:04:22.479> able

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
can see hopefully then what we're able

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.959 
can see hopefully then what we're able
to<00:04:22.930> do<00:04:23.139> is<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:23.919> still<00:04:24.190> keep<00:04:24.400> everything<00:04:24.669> nice

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
to do is to still keep everything nice

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.270 
to do is to still keep everything nice
and<00:04:25.300> parallel

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
and parallel

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.820 
and parallel
to<00:04:27.430> move<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.700> around<00:04:28.380> but<00:04:29.380> we're<00:04:29.530> still

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
to move it around but we're still

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.430 
to move it around but we're still
shooting<00:04:30.100> from<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> top<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.880> box<00:04:31.110> so<00:04:32.110> and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
shooting from the top of the box so and

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.800 
shooting from the top of the box so and
then<00:04:32.800> if<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:33.010> needed<00:04:33.190> just<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.639> fine<00:04:34.090> fine<00:04:34.570> little

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
then if I needed just a fine fine little

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.350 
then if I needed just a fine fine little
bit<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.110> tilt<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:36.070> converging<00:04:36.580> verticals<00:04:37.120> are

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
bit of tilt the converging verticals are

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.310 
bit of tilt the converging verticals are
nowhere<00:04:38.080> near<00:04:38.320> as<00:04:39.030> bad<00:04:40.030> as<00:04:40.660> they<00:04:40.900> would<00:04:41.169> have

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
nowhere near as bad as they would have

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.730 
nowhere near as bad as they would have
been<00:04:41.560> had<00:04:42.130> we<00:04:42.660> been<00:04:43.660> shooting<00:04:44.200> straight<00:04:44.500> down

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
been had we been shooting straight down

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.050 
been had we been shooting straight down
so<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.040> means<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.430> we<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.669> keep<00:04:45.820> things

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
so it means that we can keep things

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.540 
so it means that we can keep things
geometrically<00:04:46.960> correct<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.680> if<00:04:47.980> i<00:04:48.070> zoom<00:04:48.340> in

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
geometrically correct and if i zoom in

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.810 
geometrically correct and if i zoom in
quite<00:04:48.940> clearly<00:04:49.889> this<00:04:50.889> is<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.160> 50<00:04:51.580> mil

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
quite clearly this is the 50 mil

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.490 
quite clearly this is the 50 mil
Schneider<00:04:52.270> tilt<00:04:52.600> shift<00:04:52.660> lens<00:04:52.900> we<00:04:53.169> can<00:04:53.320> see

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
Schneider tilt shift lens we can see

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.830 
Schneider tilt shift lens we can see
here<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.919> our<00:04:54.130> sharp<00:04:54.820> point<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.150> focus<00:04:55.300> and

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
here is our sharp point to focus and

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.360 
here is our sharp point to focus and
then<00:04:56.590> if<00:04:56.889> I<00:04:57.010> just<00:04:57.220> gently<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.900> is<00:05:00.270> move<00:05:02.370> there

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
then if I just gently it is move there

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.920 
then if I just gently it is move there
is<00:05:03.460> my<00:05:03.610> front<00:05:03.850> point<00:05:04.090> of<00:05:04.180> focus<00:05:04.270> now<00:05:04.630> if<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.780> move

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
is my front point of focus now if I move

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.720 
is my front point of focus now if I move
everything<00:05:05.050> back<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:06.130> can<00:05:06.250> see<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.460> things

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
everything back we can see that things

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.420 
everything back we can see that things
are<00:05:06.880> starting<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.390> drift<00:05:07.810> out<00:05:08.250> but<00:05:09.250> then<00:05:09.400> I

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
are starting to drift out but then I

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.800 
are starting to drift out but then I
could<00:05:09.760> use<00:05:09.970> front<00:05:10.300> tilt<00:05:10.690> should<00:05:11.140> I<00:05:11.230> wish<00:05:12.810> just

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
could use front tilt should I wish just

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.670 
could use front tilt should I wish just
to<00:05:13.990> bring<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.710> point<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.220> focus<00:05:16.440> back<00:05:17.440> in

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
to bring that point of focus back in

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.430 
to bring that point of focus back in
again<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:19.000> just<00:05:19.210> verify<00:05:19.419> at<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.900> front<00:05:20.140> here

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
again and just verify at the front here

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.940 
again and just verify at the front here
so<00:05:21.810> we<00:05:22.810> can<00:05:22.960> see<00:05:23.140> we've<00:05:23.290> now<00:05:23.470> got<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.680> sharp

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
so we can see we've now got a sharp

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.409 
so we can see we've now got a sharp
point<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.250> photos<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.610> still<00:05:24.940> wider<00:05:25.180> we

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
point of photos this is still wider we

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.060 
point of photos this is still wider we
haven't<00:05:25.660> stopped<00:05:25.870> down<00:05:26.080> at<00:05:26.350> all<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:26.800> this<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:27.040> a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
haven't stopped down at all so this is a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.050 
haven't stopped down at all so this is a
2.8<00:05:28.950> then<00:05:29.950> once<00:05:30.190> we<00:05:30.340> stop<00:05:30.580> down<00:05:30.760> just<00:05:30.970> that

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
2.8 then once we stop down just that

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.390 
2.8 then once we stop down just that
tiny<00:05:31.390> little<00:05:31.720> bit<00:05:32.050> we'll<00:05:33.040> find<00:05:33.310> that

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
tiny little bit we'll find that

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.219 
tiny little bit we'll find that
everything<00:05:33.729> will<00:05:34.030> Crispin<00:05:34.570> up<00:05:34.690> completely

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
everything will Crispin up completely

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.900 
everything will Crispin up completely
because<00:05:35.800> we'll<00:05:35.950> be<00:05:36.070> in<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.280> sweet<00:05:36.550> spot<00:05:36.729> of

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
because we'll be in the sweet spot of

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.150 
because we'll be in the sweet spot of
the<00:05:37.120> lenses<00:05:37.570> apertures<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.229> we'll<00:05:38.919> have

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
the lenses apertures and we'll have

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.560 
the lenses apertures and we'll have
extended<00:05:39.580> depth<00:05:39.760> of<00:05:39.880> field<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.210> we'll<00:05:40.360> also

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
extended depth of field and we'll also

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.680 
extended depth of field and we'll also
be<00:05:40.870> keeping<00:05:41.320> it<00:05:41.820> geometrically<00:05:42.820> correct<00:05:43.180> it's

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
be keeping it geometrically correct it's

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.909 
be keeping it geometrically correct it's
one<00:05:43.960> of<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.200> things<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.620> sets<00:05:44.830> a

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
one of the things that sets a

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.100 
one of the things that sets a
professional<00:05:45.550> photographer<00:05:45.720> apart<00:05:46.720> from<00:05:46.960> an

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
professional photographer apart from an

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.460 
professional photographer apart from an
amateur<00:05:47.260> especially<00:05:47.950> on<00:05:48.010> a<00:05:48.100> shot<00:05:48.280> like<00:05:48.490> this

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
amateur especially on a shot like this

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.020 
amateur especially on a shot like this
so<00:05:50.470> I'm<00:05:50.740> taking<00:05:50.830> this<00:05:51.010> zero<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.520> men's<00:05:51.700> again

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
so I'm taking this zero the men's again

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.320 
so I'm taking this zero the men's again
set<00:05:52.720> it<00:05:52.840> back<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.289> its<00:05:53.440> standard<00:05:54.330> fixed

set it back to its standard fixed
settings<00:05:56.140> one<00:05:57.100> of<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.340> things<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.640> have<00:05:57.820> to

settings one of the things you have to

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.370 
settings one of the things you have to
remember<00:05:58.270> with<00:05:58.510> this<00:05:58.630> is<00:05:58.780> it<00:05:58.900> works<00:05:59.110> just<00:05:59.289> like

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
remember with this is it works just like

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.580 
remember with this is it works just like
a<00:05:59.500> large<00:05:59.740> format<00:06:00.100> lens<00:06:00.340> in<00:06:00.640> that<00:06:01.600> we<00:06:02.229> have<00:06:02.440> to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
a large format lens in that we have to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.460 
a large format lens in that we have to
set<00:06:02.890> our<00:06:02.919> aperture<00:06:03.520> manually<00:06:04.419> we<00:06:05.140> have<00:06:05.320> to

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
set our aperture manually we have to

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.400 
set our aperture manually we have to
focus<00:06:05.979> manually<00:06:06.490> but<00:06:07.270> then<00:06:07.450> we<00:06:07.600> also<00:06:07.780> have<00:06:08.200> to

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
focus manually but then we also have to

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.409 
focus manually but then we also have to
stop<00:06:09.070> the<00:06:09.280> lens<00:06:09.490> down<00:06:09.789> to<00:06:10.000> the<00:06:10.090> working

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
stop the lens down to the working

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.600 
stop the lens down to the working
aperture<00:06:10.870> this<00:06:11.440> allows<00:06:11.860> us<00:06:11.890> to<00:06:12.370> view<00:06:12.550> a

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
aperture this allows us to view a

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.420 
aperture this allows us to view a
maximum<00:06:13.450> aperture<00:06:13.630> all<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.110> time<00:06:14.320> as<00:06:15.100> long<00:06:15.280> as

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
maximum aperture all the time as long as

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.219 
maximum aperture all the time as long as
we're<00:06:15.550> focusing<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.090> composing<00:06:16.600> but<00:06:17.110> then

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
we're focusing and composing but then

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.659 
we're focusing and composing but then
before<00:06:17.380> we<00:06:17.680> shoot<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:17.979> picture<00:06:18.280> we<00:06:18.370> have<00:06:18.520> to

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
before we shoot the picture we have to

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.950 
before we shoot the picture we have to
stop<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.210> lens<00:06:19.419> down<00:06:20.640> the<00:06:21.640> advantage<00:06:22.539> to<00:06:22.780> this

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
stop the lens down the advantage to this

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.510 
stop the lens down the advantage to this
is<00:06:23.200> that<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:24.430> lens<00:06:24.700> has<00:06:24.880> no<00:06:26.039> electronic<00:06:27.039> input

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
is that the lens has no electronic input

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.060 
is that the lens has no electronic input
to<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:27.940> camera<00:06:28.360> so<00:06:29.320> it<00:06:29.410> doesn't<00:06:29.800> tell<00:06:29.950> the

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
to the camera so it doesn't tell the

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.820 
to the camera so it doesn't tell the
camera<00:06:30.280> what<00:06:30.370> apertures<00:06:30.850> in<00:06:31.000> use<00:06:31.470> or<00:06:32.470> what

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
amount of shifts in use but it does

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.710 
amount of shifts in use but it does

of course buy in a Nick on mount and

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.080 
of course buy in a Nick on mount and
then<00:07:13.810> use<00:07:14.050> a<00:07:14.080> high<00:07:14.380> quality<00:07:14.710> precision<00:07:15.400> Nick

then use a high quality precision Nick

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.210 
then use a high quality precision Nick
onto<00:07:16.390> canon<00:07:16.690> adapter<00:07:17.200> so<00:07:17.740> therefore<00:07:18.040> it<00:07:18.100> makes

it very very quick to change from one to

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.020 
it very very quick to change from one to
another<00:07:20.170> means<00:07:20.860> it's<00:07:21.010> good<00:07:21.280> for<00:07:21.550> a<00:07:21.610> busy
