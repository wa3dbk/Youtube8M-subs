00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.639

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
for me going to UNC I I kind of had

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.219 
for me going to UNC I I kind of had
these<00:01:21.770> expectations<00:01:22.549> of<00:01:22.909> what<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.990> was<00:01:24.140> going

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
these expectations of what it was going

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.100 
these expectations of what it was going
to<00:01:24.350> be<00:01:24.530> like<00:01:24.680> from<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.070> soccer<00:01:25.250> standpoint<00:01:26.110> but

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
to be like from a soccer standpoint but

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.899 
to be like from a soccer standpoint but
I<00:01:27.170> didn't<00:01:27.560> really<00:01:27.800> know<00:01:28.570> exactly<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.320> type<00:01:30.650> of

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
I didn't really know exactly the type of

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.070 
I didn't really know exactly the type of
family<00:01:31.909> environment<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.659> would<00:01:32.900> have

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
family environment that I would have

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.240 
family environment that I would have
coming<00:01:33.860> from<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.340> very<00:01:34.820> close<00:01:35.060> family<00:01:36.250> with

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
coming from a very close family with

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.789 
coming from a very close family with
like<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.490> lot<00:01:37.760> of<00:01:37.790> love<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:39.080> kind<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.470> are

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
like a lot of love you kind of are

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.149 
like a lot of love you kind of are
scared<00:01:40.159> when<00:01:40.430> you<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:41.090> leave<00:01:41.299> for<00:01:41.540> college

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
scared when you you leave for college

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.380 
scared when you you leave for college
even<00:01:43.159> though<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.280> had<00:01:43.430> traveled<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.000> much<00:01:44.030> I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
even though I had traveled so much I

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.750 
even though I had traveled so much I
always<00:01:44.659> could<00:01:44.810> come<00:01:44.990> home<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:45.860> spending<00:01:46.370> four

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
always could come home but spending four

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.660 
always could come home but spending four
years<00:01:47.030> away<00:01:47.390> from<00:01:47.570> home<00:01:47.930> was<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.650> little<00:01:49.070> scary

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
years away from home was a little scary

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.180 
years away from home was a little scary
but<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.210> think<00:01:50.330> as<00:01:50.750> soon<00:01:50.960> as<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.320> got<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:51.920> campus

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
but I think as soon as I got on campus

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.660 
but I think as soon as I got on campus
and<00:01:52.549> felt<00:01:52.760> that<00:01:53.590> family<00:01:54.590> environment<00:01:54.950> that

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
and felt that family environment that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.600 
and felt that family environment that
they<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.420> realized<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.890> wasn't<00:01:58.400> really

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
they have I realized I wasn't really

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.280 
they have I realized I wasn't really
missing

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
being accepted into another one and it's

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.350 
being accepted into another one and it's
not<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.950> your<00:02:06.130> family<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.580> four<00:02:06.790> years<00:02:07.090> it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
not just your family for four years it

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.960 
not just your family for four years it
continues<00:02:07.840> throughout<00:02:08.830> your<00:02:09.010> life<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.580> it's

continues throughout your life so it's

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.820 
continues throughout your life so it's
special<00:02:10.180> like<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.270> many<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
special like that I was just so many I

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.260 
special like that I was just so many I
think<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.010> biggest<00:02:18.780> misconception<00:02:19.780> about<00:02:20.650> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
think the biggest misconception about a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.390 
think the biggest misconception about a
tough<00:02:22.270> word<00:02:22.540> say<00:02:22.840> JA<00:02:23.680> UNC<00:02:24.330> would<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:26.400> I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
tough word say JA UNC would have to be I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.970 
tough word say JA UNC would have to be I
think<00:02:28.000> people<00:02:28.750> think<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:28.990> we<00:02:29.230> take<00:02:29.500> things

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
think people think that we take things

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.220 
think people think that we take things
really<00:02:30.130> serious<00:02:30.820> there<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:33.660> think<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.960> take

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
really serious there and I think we take

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.830 
really serious there and I think we take
winning<00:02:35.650> very<00:02:35.800> seriously<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.270> think<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
winning very seriously but I think the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.460 
winning very seriously but I think the
process<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:42.310> fun<00:02:42.520> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
process of that is just really fun and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.220 
process of that is just really fun and
as<00:02:44.470> much<00:02:44.890> as<00:02:44.950> we're<00:02:45.910> super<00:02:46.330> competitive<00:02:46.660> on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
as much as we're super competitive on

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.880 
as much as we're super competitive on
the<00:02:47.290> field<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.970> seem<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.270> have<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:49.890> genuine

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the field we seem to have this genuine

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.150 
the field we seem to have this genuine
love<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.480> caring<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.600> one<00:02:52.930> another<00:02:53.160> that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
love and caring for one another that

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.960 
love and caring for one another that
then<00:02:55.150> helps<00:02:55.810> us<00:02:55.959> propel<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.580> field<00:02:57.790> but

your soccer experience there my favorite

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.410 
your soccer experience there my favorite
part<00:03:57.330> about<00:03:57.630> UNC<00:03:58.560> probably<00:03:59.280> had<00:03:59.970> nothing<00:04:00.330> to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
part about UNC probably had nothing to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.970 
part about UNC probably had nothing to
do<00:04:00.570> with<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.050> soccer<00:04:01.290> which<00:04:01.650> was<00:04:01.800> really

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
do with the soccer which was really

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.040 
do with the soccer which was really
surprising

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
surprising

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.400 
surprising
I<00:04:04.459> think<00:04:05.459> off<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.270> field<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.690> campus<00:04:07.230> is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
I think off the field the campus is

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.160 
I think off the field the campus is
beautiful<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:08.510> was<00:04:09.739> challenged<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.890> school<00:04:11.250> and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
beautiful I was challenged in school and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.909 
beautiful I was challenged in school and
I<00:04:13.170> think<00:04:13.680> living<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.120> southern<00:04:15.810> way<00:04:16.260> was

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
I think living in that southern way was

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.130 
I think living in that southern way was
different<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.519> me<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.910> like<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.570> slower<00:04:18.840> pace

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
different for me I like the slower pace

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.490 
different for me I like the slower pace
it<00:04:19.560> kind<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.859> goes<00:04:20.040> well<00:04:20.280> with<00:04:20.400> my<00:04:20.549> style<00:04:21.500> and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
it kind of goes well with my style and

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.340 
it kind of goes well with my style and
just<00:04:23.400> everything<00:04:24.240> about<00:04:24.450> UNC

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
just everything about UNC

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.140 
just everything about UNC
it's<00:04:25.440> just<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:26.010> place<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.490> feels<00:04:26.669> really<00:04:26.970> good

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it's just a place that feels really good

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.020 
it's just a place that feels really good
and<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.540> place<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:29.220> kind<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.490> take<00:04:29.700> an

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
and a place that you kind of take an

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.630 
and a place that you kind of take an
identity<00:04:30.540> with<00:04:30.840> after<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.560> while<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.430> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640

baby blue so in that way I think a lot
of<00:04:37.890> things<00:04:38.100> surprised<00:04:38.610> me<00:04:38.820> about<00:04:38.910> going<00:04:39.240> there

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.260 
that didn't have to do a soccer which
was<00:04:42.930> really<00:04:43.470> cool

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.780
