00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.040 
rice just near the top of the top of the
bucket<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:51.780> you're<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:53.809> go<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.989> a

fairly<00:00:55.440> high<00:00:55.590> intensity<00:00:56.100> once<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> get

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fairly high intensity once you get

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
fairly high intensity once you get
started<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> make<00:00:57.570> sure<00:00:57.600> your

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
as close to the bottom of the barrel as

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.290 
as close to the bottom of the barrel as
possible<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.580> either<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:20.880> time

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
possible so you can either go for time

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.740 
possible so you can either go for time
so<00:01:21.870> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.580> 20<00:01:23.580> seconds<00:01:23.910> 30<00:01:24.090> seconds<00:01:24.450> 40

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you can just count reps if you don't

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.820 
you can just count reps if you don't
have<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> clock<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.730> I<00:01:29.760> usually<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.530> 20<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.620> 30

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
have a clock so I usually go 20 to 30

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:47.749 
have a clock so I usually go 20 to 30
reps<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> I'll<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> 20<00:01:34.140> reps<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.610> got

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
reps so I'll do 20 reps here so I got

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
as fast as you can the rice should be

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.660 
as fast as you can the rice should be
popping<00:05:44.550> out<00:05:44.670> of<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:44.850> garbage<00:05:45.660> pin<00:05:49.670> that

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
popping out of the garbage pin that

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.220 
popping out of the garbage pin that
one's<00:05:50.790> more<00:05:50.940> for<00:05:51.120> speed<00:05:52.010> that's<00:05:53.010> it
