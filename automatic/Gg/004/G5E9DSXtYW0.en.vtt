 hello welcome to my alelÃ­ channel 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.340
 call today I want to show you how to do 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.279
 a rice with milk is very easy either 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.170
 simple to do and well the only thing 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.090
 that we need rice here 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.339
 I have the lawyer drained too 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 here I have vanilla I have cinnamon sugar 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:28.829
 and some milk evaporated my milk 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.120
 regular I will add what is the 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.980
 cinnamon and everything else and have the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.110
 fire 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.110
 so I'm going to let it boil 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 everyone 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 and once it hurts I'm going down the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 fire and I will incorporate what is the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
 vanilla and I'm also going to add what 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.960
 It is evaporated and tell them I'll let 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.690
 boil but I'm always moving well 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.159
 Well, my rice is boiling here 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.559
 then already what actually exists as 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.340
 twice of the fire then I'm going to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.890
 lower him 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.040
 I'm going to lower the fire as low as possible 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.220
 may i 'll be stirring too and 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.500
 if it happens to them so it goes up and this to a 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.450
 chair went down 16 and it keeps going up 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.290
 only remove from the fire of the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 Grill well 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.120
 and continue moving again and put the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.280
 will come back again 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.290
 until there is going to be a moment where 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.300
 milk is already cooked they grab it with the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.760
 finger and you will see that it is already 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.010
