00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.859
 early in the morning at the foot of the high black 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.559
 everyone is still sleeping 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.139
 really all 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.839
 No one is already on his feet and in the middle of the beautiful nature 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 more than 22,000 of them are in Styria 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.420
 and they have a great task preserving biodiversity us the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.310
 Wildlife health in an intact habitat that happens through 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.730
 on the one hand, Bremen habitat by creating the habitats of wildlife 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.520
 shape 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.809
 in order we 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.799
 rise 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.689
 Percent off the right structures percentages in the wildlife stock 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:01.610
 watch 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.429
 and among collectors 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.860
 then just percent gives this ideal goal that we aim for 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.170
 as it certainly forbids men the most important thing it means 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 possible to keep the habitat 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.350
 and I am private 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.660
 because that's the big buzzword it's all about with weather 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.960
 do but it just has 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.630
 to create and preserve the habitat 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.180
 and then it stays mild daughter 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 just like us humans, the wild animals have their needs once 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.230
 Debut t-bone, so to speak 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.050
 the 2 Red 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.790
 and the third is the food 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.850
 the people are the British 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.880
 Percent in time and space 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.909
 so and how they have their way with the Irish 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.330
 that is especially in the twilight time in the morning 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.870
 and with it, if the Wied you 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.110
 there for food intake 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.720
 Percent in the clearing go or even fluent the EM 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.090
 that is taken into consideration here 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 that the wild animals at rest gates 8 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:12.809
 the passengers are the wide the area moves directly 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.249
 42 outdoor sports are running 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:23.549
 and here we are looking for and improvement in consideration, especially in their 6 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.549
 and rearing time GÃ¼nther young animals 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.569
 this will not be disturbed 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.280
 spring is the time where it is not properly defended and the offspring is 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.260
 World come straight in this period, these animals need special protection 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.899
 Protection also needs their habitat, the pictures then under 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:42.620
 circumstances 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.840
 Commit to the city shared important function of hunting courage 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.379
 Has 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.150
 tried to keep down with stones as possible and even further down 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.079
 then reluctantly keep the records under roe deer that have no natural 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.609
 Enemy without hunt will simply ascend and export in the valley 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.639
 and thus everyone really equal among them also of the agriculture 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.259
 learned something elderly 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.679
 the urban hunters and hunters certainly have one too 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.219
 He will help with economic function 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.489
 to avoid major material damage in agriculture and forestry 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.259
 But hunting is not just important for the economy 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.329
 It also acts as a catalyst for the science we have 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.269
 tub 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.159
 Iceland has a wealth of experience from the hunting community 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.889
 a oyster basic research research of science 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.039
 Percent as well as applied research will get newest 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.199
 the Tricolor Vischer findings 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.570
 OMV the combination of these two 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.340
 that brings us further in knowledge and because of that and the habitats and the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.669
 Interaction between pillows remain 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.779
 the knowledge of the native game and its way of life were ready 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:53.620
 we 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.919
 For example, I have had a project 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.810
 and percent from casting 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.830
 compensates for great results out there and now we are a markets 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.679
 AMS wants to pursue the pure now 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.889
 a where we could see today 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.709
 what the above and how it's the thrusts 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.959
 carried out and dedications letters the very little the whole and the whole 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.030
 existing with satellite transmitters 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.720
 but it's just about all possible basics like populations 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.120
 ecology looks like a lot of money Tietz important that propagates the mother 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.449
 Aden the population structure somehow can not raise Romand then then 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.880
 further unleashed with Therese Moss and hunting unfinished as open annoying 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.750
 a whole important branch of the opponents of the hunt is driven the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.310
 has so many important features the most original is the delivery of 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.310
 Delicacies from the woods right on our plate their stripes 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.129
 is the most popular among them 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.580
 then with example I buy 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.129
 after all, it's crazy 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.970
 and 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.259
 that are coming 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.150
 it is 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.940
 still a big hit or cool relaxed to Â«It is actually now 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.289
 the harvest is 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.389
 so at the hostage-taking in the current week with Stephan Kramer and Zuweiser 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.150
 the Linzer 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.110
 DAPD 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.659
 Their tasks are varied and not easy to fulfill 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.749
 the hunters Finke do not always have the social acceptance there 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.749
 they should have because of their important function 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.599
 and yet we need her 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.039
 as keeper of landscape and nature
