below and again on the top left you'll
have<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> link<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> inside<00:01:27.750> out

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
have a link there for the inside out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
have a link there for the inside out
dribble<00:01:28.140> inside<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.710> dribble<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> great

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
dribble inside all dribble is a great

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
dribble inside all dribble is a great
move<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> your

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
move to have down to have in your

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
move to have down to have in your
arsenal<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.590> quicker<00:01:31.829> than<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.070> crossover

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
arsenal it's quicker than a crossover

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.580 
arsenal it's quicker than a crossover
but<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.150> doing<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.509> cross<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.110> re-cross

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
but it's like doing a cross and re-cross

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.520 
but it's like doing a cross and re-cross
or<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.070> fake<00:01:35.400> crossover<00:01:36.210> next<00:01:37.170> one's<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.409> be

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
or a fake crossover next one's gonna be

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
or a fake crossover next one's gonna be
the<00:01:37.680> behind<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.280> dribble<00:01:38.490> there's<00:01:39.210> two

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the behind the back dribble there's two

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.700 
the behind the back dribble there's two
different<00:01:39.540> ways<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.500> first

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
different ways you can do it the first

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
different ways you can do it the first
way<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.759> both<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.150> feet

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
way is like this with both your feet

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
way is like this with both your feet
planted<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.049> dribbling<00:01:43.409> side<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> side<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
planted just dribbling side to side so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
planted just dribbling side to side so
you'd<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.610> driving<00:01:44.970> you'd<00:01:45.329> stop<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.290> go

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you'd be driving you'd stop and you go

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
you'd be driving you'd stop and you go
behind<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.890> back<00:01:47.070> there's<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.850> slow<00:01:48.060> motion

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
behind the back there's a slow motion

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.490 
behind the back there's a slow motion
for<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.350> looks

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
for you so you can see what it looks

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840 
for you so you can see what it looks
like<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.799> bit<00:01:49.950> more<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
like a little bit more and then you can

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090 
like a little bit more and then you can
also<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.689> two<00:01:52.020> step<00:01:52.380> behind<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.860> back

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
also do a one two step behind the back
