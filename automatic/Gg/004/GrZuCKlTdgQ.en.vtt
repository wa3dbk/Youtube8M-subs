welcome<00:00:03.179> back<00:00:03.389> where<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.470> time<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.160> be

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
welcome back where this time going to be

welcome back where this time going to be
in<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.520> mid<00:00:05.759> power<00:00:06.060> fr<00:00:06.990> car<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> 350z<00:00:08.670> I

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
in a mid power fr car this is a 350z I

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.580 
in a mid power fr car this is a 350z I
find<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.170> very<00:00:10.610> well-balanced

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
find that it's very well-balanced

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.039 
find that it's very well-balanced
control<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.670> good<00:00:14.849> place<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.420> learn<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
control and a good place to learn how to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.470 
control and a good place to learn how to
really<00:00:16.410> drift<00:00:16.800> more<00:00:17.220> horsepower<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.270> car

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
really drift more horsepower so in a car

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.179 
really drift more horsepower so in a car
like<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.710> careful

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
like this you have to be be careful

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.279 
like this you have to be be careful
about<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.760> entry<00:00:24.090> speed<00:00:24.390> even<00:00:24.689> more<00:00:25.050> because

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
about your entry speed even more because

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.859 
about your entry speed even more because
you<00:00:25.619> will<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.490> faster<00:00:26.970> than<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you will be going a lot faster than you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.070 
you will be going a lot faster than you
were<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.650> z4<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.750> sure<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.050> just

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
were in the z4 so make sure you just

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.430 
were in the z4 so make sure you just
control<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.859> speed<00:00:32.250> into<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> corner<00:00:36.440> balance

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
control your speed into a corner balance

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.950 
control your speed into a corner balance
it<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.800> darwen<00:00:38.760> steering<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it out with darwen steering and you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
it out with darwen steering and you
should<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.200> able<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.649> trick<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.219> cars

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
should be able to trick these cars

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.440 
should be able to trick these cars
beautifully<00:00:42.420> um<00:00:46.070> let's<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.090> fast

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
beautifully um let's go up to this fast

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.840 
beautifully um let's go up to this fast
section<00:00:49.340> 5th<00:00:50.340> walk<00:00:50.579> here

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.370 

some<00:00:58.850> car<00:00:59.180> like<00:00:59.390> this<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.750> really<00:00:59.960> have<00:01:00.200> to<00:01:00.350> be

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
some car like this you really have to be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.720 
some car like this you really have to be
be<00:01:00.650> careful<00:01:01.070> about<00:01:01.340> your<00:01:02.560> drama<00:01:03.820> puts<00:01:04.900> day

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
be careful about your drama puts day

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.940 
be careful about your drama puts day
maybe<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:08.690> biggest<00:01:08.930> difference<00:01:09.320> when<00:01:09.800> you

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
maybe the biggest difference when you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.870 
maybe the biggest difference when you
have<00:01:10.160> more<00:01:10.550> horsepower<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:13.430> let's<00:01:13.670> go<00:01:13.850> through

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
have more horsepower so let's go through

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.820 
have more horsepower so let's go through
and<00:01:14.420> maybe<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.750> can<00:01:14.900> see<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.470> difference

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
and maybe you can see the difference

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.270 
and maybe you can see the difference
between<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.460> z4<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.300> car<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.980> notice

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
between the z4 and this car you notice

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.070 
between the z4 and this car you notice
we're<00:01:19.430> going<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.670> lot<00:01:19.790> faster<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.540> let's<00:01:20.750> break

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
we're going a lot faster so let's break

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.280 
we're going a lot faster so let's break
lot<00:01:21.500> earlier<00:01:22.300> just<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.450> be<00:01:23.630> safe<00:01:23.870> just<00:01:23.930> to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
lot earlier just to be safe just to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.090 
lot earlier just to be safe just to
control<00:01:24.650> use<00:01:24.890> your<00:01:25.370> speed<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.820> require<00:01:30.100> notice

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
control use your speed to require notice

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.260 
control use your speed to require notice
I'm<00:01:31.550> covering<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.090> towel<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.960> lot<00:01:33.590> more<00:01:34.270> that's

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
I'm covering the towel a lot more that's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.020 
I'm covering the towel a lot more that's
just<00:01:35.570> because<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:36.170> car<00:01:36.590> has<00:01:36.860> more<00:01:37.040> power<00:01:37.670> to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
just because this car has more power to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:49.719 
just because this car has more power to
give<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.500> more<00:01:48.530> power<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
give and the more power you have the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.160 
give and the more power you have the
more<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.150> back<00:01:50.360> end<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.720> going<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.020> be

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
more the back end is going to be

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.400 
more the back end is going to be
squirming<00:01:52.040> around<00:01:52.340> on<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.140> want

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
squirming around on you so you just want

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:14.770 
squirming around on you so you just want
to<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.710> careful<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.690> control<00:01:56.690> it<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.510> used

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
to be careful and control it so get used

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.130 
to be careful and control it so get used
to<00:02:14.900> these<00:02:15.080> these<00:02:15.380> are<00:02:15.620> mid<00:02:16.130> power<00:02:16.370> cars<00:02:16.960> like<00:02:17.960> I

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
to these these are mid power cars like I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.770 
to these these are mid power cars like I
said<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.650> want<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> use<00:02:19.070> weight<00:02:19.850> shift<00:02:20.180> same

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
said you want to use weight shift same

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.190 
said you want to use weight shift same
thing<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.590> learned<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> cappuccino

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
thing as you learned in the cappuccino

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.340 
thing as you learned in the cappuccino
but<00:02:24.200> you're<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.010> be

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
but you're just going to be

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.090 
but you're just going to be
concentrating<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.440> lot<00:02:27.470> more<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.069> your

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
concentrating a lot more on your

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.980 
concentrating a lot more on your
throttle<00:02:28.790> input<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.540> does<00:02:29.720> change

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
throttle input because it does change

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.950 
throttle input because it does change
the<00:02:30.140> attitude<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.069> car<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.460> lot<00:02:31.730> more<00:02:32.030> but

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the attitude of the car a lot more but

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:42.640 
the attitude of the car a lot more but
it<00:02:33.110> didn't<00:02:33.530> musi<00:02:33.830> through<00:02:34.190> Z<00:02:34.760> feel<00:02:35.060> sorry

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.100 

so<00:02:43.650> let's<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.280> another<00:02:44.580> lap<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.540> maybe

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
so let's get another lap in and maybe

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.410 
so let's get another lap in and maybe
you<00:02:46.260> could<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.650> even<00:02:47.220> more<00:02:47.550> difference<00:02:48.030> pay

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
you could see even more difference pay

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:18.790 
you could see even more difference pay
attention<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.080> feather<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.890> throttle

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.170 

too<00:03:19.800> much<00:03:20.010> steering<00:03:22.460> so<00:03:23.460> let's<00:03:23.670> try<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.120> get

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
too much steering so let's try and get

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.710 
too much steering so let's try and get
this<00:03:24.240> long<00:03:24.900> corner<00:03:25.500> nice<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.010> clean<00:03:26.570> like<00:03:27.570> I

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
this long corner nice and clean like I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.630 
this long corner nice and clean like I
said<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.560> control<00:03:28.950> your<00:03:29.160> entry

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
said you have to control your entry

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:40.600 
said you have to control your entry
speed<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.950> don't<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.160> afraid<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.520> slow<00:03:32.880> down

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610
