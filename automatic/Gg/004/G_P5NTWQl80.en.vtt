 hello friends welcome to this second universal guitar video instantly 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.530
 we are going to 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.869
 to learn 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.169
 in the technique of the capo 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.239
 we are also going to have some some chords that have capo 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.460
 learn some rhythms 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.380
 this to apply the chords that we would have a small 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.300
 introduction 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.210
 to the enclosure 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.710
 which is to play melodies 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.080
 with the guitar friends are ready 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.790
 Victor text ready it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.090
 one day later 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.660
 let's start 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.570
 the segi lladÃ³s / is a technique that requires quotas in the following way 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.620
 he was one of the left hand 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.490
 we are going to 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.580
 pose on all the strings the fretboard 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.010
 all the strings of the guitar 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.790
 on the fret 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.140
 we need it is to say that with one finger we are going to step on all the ropes 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.320
 by the way bows to place the bar we need to know the correct technique 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.710
 this is very important since 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.870
 percent in our hand 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.260
 have a muscle here 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.080
 which is a very delicate muscle that loan in this way 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.870
 we can hurt them 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.080
 then the correct way to hold the bar 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.870
 exerting the pressure 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.070
 first from the shoulder 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 in this way we are going to give a small room back 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 then let's drop the hand taking advantage 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 this percy the severity of the fall 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 and finally 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.960
 already we speak with him thumb of the left hand a slight squeeze 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.960
 and with that we have a bar strong enough to sound 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960
 clean with rope 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 Viktor on it please place the bar 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.649
 as the face as he ended up demonstrating 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:31.319
 force goods from the shoulder leave dropping the hand and nothing else 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.379
 Squeezing lightly 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
 now if you touch agreement by four please 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.549
 m 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 let's start with the tone of the minors 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.749
 then we are going to 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.149
 place our bar 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.629
 as we said 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.869
