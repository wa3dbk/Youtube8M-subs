back<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> shirt<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.010> start<00:00:29.279> with

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
back of the shirt so you can start with

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.810 
back of the shirt so you can start with
the<00:00:29.550> shirt<00:00:29.730> facedown<00:00:31.279> we're<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.579> start

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the shirt facedown we're going to start

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
the shirt facedown we're going to start
by<00:00:33.170> measuring<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:34.920> underneath<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
by measuring right underneath the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.790 
by measuring right underneath the
armpits<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.899> you're<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
armpits so you're not going to want to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.530 
armpits so you're not going to want to
cut<00:00:37.980> higher<00:00:38.190> than<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.579> because<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.270> going

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
cut higher than that because it's going

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
cut higher than that because it's going
to<00:00:39.690> ruin<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> way<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> shirt<00:00:40.530> sits<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to ruin the way the shirt sits on you so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
to ruin the way the shirt sits on you so
using<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> measuring<00:00:42.270> tape<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
using the measuring tape I'm going to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
using the measuring tape I'm going to
measure<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.110> far<00:00:43.469> down<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.129> cut<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> be

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
measure how far down I want my cut to be

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.770 
measure how far down I want my cut to be
and<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.770> measure<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> across<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.969> then

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and then measure that across and then

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
and then measure that across and then
you<00:00:49.050> could<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.350> put<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> rough<00:00:49.980> mark<00:00:50.430> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you could just put like a rough mark on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
you could just put like a rough mark on
the<00:00:51.270> shirt<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.230> follow<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the shirt that way you can follow that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
the shirt that way you can follow that
line<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> next<00:00:58.260> step<00:00:58.469> would<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.180> measure

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
line the next step would be to measure

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
line the next step would be to measure
the<00:01:00.539> sides<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> shirt<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> going

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the sides of the shirt so this is going

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.630 
the sides of the shirt so this is going
to<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.989> cutting

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
to be where you're going to be cutting

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.920 
to be where you're going to be cutting
you<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> make<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> even<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.780> doing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you want to make it even so I'm doing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.649 
you want to make it even so I'm doing
about<00:01:07.140> two<00:01:07.530> inches<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.189> each<00:01:08.520> side<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
about two inches from each side of the
shirt<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.799> start<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> seam

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
shirt so you just start from the seam

shirt so you just start from the seam
measure<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.780> inches<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.590> put<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
little marker and then you could do the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
little marker and then you could do the
same<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> other<00:01:17.340> side<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.090> good<00:01:18.270> thing

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
same to the other side the good thing

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570

about<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.869> DIY<00:01:19.259> crop<00:01:19.890> top<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
about this DIY crop top is that it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
about this DIY crop top is that it
doesn't<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.299> perfectly<00:01:21.810> even<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
doesn't have to be perfectly even so

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.969 
doesn't have to be perfectly even so
even<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.369> markers<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.799> exactly<00:01:25.799> two

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
even if your markers are not exactly two

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
even if your markers are not exactly two
inches<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:26.820> fine<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:27.990> you're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
inches then that's fine so now you're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
inches then that's fine so now you're
ready<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.500> start<00:01:28.770> cutting<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> shirt<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.240> just

cutting<00:01:44.540> you're<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.869> doing<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
cutting you're going to be doing the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
cutting you're going to be doing the
same<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> other<00:01:47.009> side<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
same thing to the other side of the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
same thing to the other side of the
shirt<00:01:47.880> again<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> lines<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.799> perfect

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
shirt again if the lines are not perfect

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.889 
shirt again if the lines are not perfect
and<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.579> cutting<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.450> jagged<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and your cutting is kind of jagged and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
and your cutting is kind of jagged and
zigzag<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.250> okay<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:53.820> those<00:01:54.090> are

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
zigzag that is okay because those are

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.319 
zigzag that is okay because those are
going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.509> hidden<00:01:54.720> anyways<00:01:56.119> after<00:01:57.119> cutting

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
going to be hidden anyways after cutting

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.060 
going to be hidden anyways after cutting
both<00:01:57.600> sides<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.079> should<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.439> left<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.920> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
both sides you should be left with this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.240 
both sides you should be left with this
sort<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.490> flappy<00:02:00.229> piece<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> back<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.130> your

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
sort of flappy piece on the back of your

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.359 
sort of flappy piece on the back of your
shirt<00:02:03.170> now<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> final<00:02:04.619> step<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
shirt now the final step for the back of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.670 
shirt now the final step for the back of
your<00:02:05.700> crop<00:02:05.969> top<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.479> cutting<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.170> flap<00:02:07.409> off

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
your crop top is cutting that flap off

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.669 
your crop top is cutting that flap off
so<00:02:08.399> you're<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.640> gonna<00:02:08.819> start<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:10.349> one<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so you're just gonna start at one of the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.050 
so you're just gonna start at one of the
corners<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> cut<00:02:11.819> straight

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
corners and cut straight

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.000 
corners and cut straight
again<00:02:13.420> you're<00:02:13.630> going<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:13.959> using<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.560> mark

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
again you're going to be using that mark

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.590 
again you're going to be using that mark
that<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.280> made<00:02:15.459> in<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> middle<00:02:15.970> as<00:02:16.180> kind<00:02:16.480> of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
that we made in the middle as kind of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.420 
that we made in the middle as kind of
your<00:02:16.660> guideline<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.770> make<00:02:17.950> sure<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.220> don't

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
your guideline so make sure you don't

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.809 
your guideline so make sure you don't
cut<00:02:18.610> any<00:02:18.819> higher<00:02:19.090> than<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:20.319> line<00:02:20.819> is

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
cut any higher than that this line is

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.340 
cut any higher than that this line is
probably<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.300> bit<00:02:22.450> more<00:02:22.660> important<00:02:23.140> because

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
probably a bit more important because

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.480 
probably a bit more important because
it's<00:02:24.340> going<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:25.470> how<00:02:26.470> will<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> shirt<00:02:27.069> sits

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
it's going to be how will the shirt sits

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.160 
it's going to be how will the shirt sits
on<00:02:27.730> your<00:02:27.970> back<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.780> might<00:02:28.930> want

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
on your back so this one you might want

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.490 
on your back so this one you might want
to<00:02:29.230> try<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.620> make<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:30.120> semi<00:02:31.120> straight<00:02:31.500> step

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
to try and make it semi straight step

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.320 
to try and make it semi straight step
two<00:02:32.830> you're<00:02:33.220> going<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.520> cutting<00:02:33.730> right

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
two you're going to be cutting right

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.809 
two you're going to be cutting right
down<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.810> front<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.470> shirt<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.670> flip

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
down the front of the shirt so just flip

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.750 
down the front of the shirt so just flip
your<00:02:37.030> shirt<00:02:37.330> over<00:02:37.950> lay<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.100> out<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.520> it's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
your shirt over lay it out so that it's

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.180 
your shirt over lay it out so that it's
flat<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.600> material<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.650> even<00:02:44.190> now

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
flat and that the material is even now

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.770 
flat and that the material is even now
for<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.730> kind<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.150> eyeballed<00:02:46.570> it

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
for this I just kind of eyeballed it

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.660 
for this I just kind of eyeballed it
it's<00:02:47.019> kind<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.470> easy<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.980> figure<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's kind of easy just to figure out the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.600 
it's kind of easy just to figure out the
middle<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> shirt<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:51.250> start

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
middle of the shirt so just start

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.449 
middle of the shirt so just start
cutting<00:02:52.000> all<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.540> way<00:02:52.660> down<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.980> end

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.539 

now<00:03:01.209> we<00:03:01.269> are<00:03:01.659> done<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.469> hard<00:03:02.680> work<00:03:02.799> if

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
now we are done all of the hard work if

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.429 
now we are done all of the hard work if
you<00:03:03.730> lay<00:03:03.909> your<00:03:04.030> shirt<00:03:04.269> out<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.719> is<00:03:04.900> what<00:03:05.109> the

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
you lay your shirt out this is what the

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.380 
you lay your shirt out this is what the
cutouts<00:03:05.980> should<00:03:06.159> look<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.489> when<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> put

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
cutouts should look like when you put

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.789 
cutouts should look like when you put
the<00:03:07.480> cropped<00:03:07.689> up<00:03:07.870> on<00:03:08.019> just<00:03:08.260> put<00:03:08.379> it<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the cropped up on just put it on like a

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.709 
the cropped up on just put it on like a
vest<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.430> then<00:03:09.879> you're<00:03:10.030> gonna<00:03:10.120> take<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.510> two

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
vest and then you're gonna take the two

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.410 
vest and then you're gonna take the two
front<00:03:11.019> pieces<00:03:11.200> wrap<00:03:12.129> them<00:03:12.340> evenly<00:03:12.670> around<00:03:13.090> you

front pieces wrap them evenly around you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.750 
front pieces wrap them evenly around you

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
and then secure them in the back in a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.809 
and then secure them in the back in a
knot<00:03:15.969> now<00:03:16.840> those<00:03:17.230> pieces<00:03:17.500> upfront<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.700> I'm

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
knot now those pieces upfront that I'm

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.789 
knot now those pieces upfront that I'm
playing<00:03:19.060> with<00:03:19.359> those<00:03:20.260> are<00:03:20.409> just<00:03:20.590> kind<00:03:20.739> of

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
playing with those are just kind of

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.220 
playing with those are just kind of
jagged<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.299> just<00:03:22.450> tuck<00:03:22.629> those<00:03:22.810> into

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
jagged so you can just tuck those into

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.080 
jagged so you can just tuck those into
your<00:03:23.260> bra<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.950> then<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.489> gives<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.879> nice

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
your bra and then it gives it a nice

clean<00:03:25.389> and<00:03:25.689> sleek<00:03:25.840> look<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.769> why<00:03:26.920> we

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
clean and sleek look that's why we

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.229 
clean and sleek look that's why we
weren't<00:03:27.250> too<00:03:27.370> worried<00:03:27.639> about<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.939> jagged

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
weren't too worried about the jagged

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.809 
weren't too worried about the jagged
lines<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.769> there<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.219> have<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.519> there<00:03:30.790> is

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
lines and there you have it there is

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.289 
lines and there you have it there is
