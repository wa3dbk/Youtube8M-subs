00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hey today's video I stopped three tips from 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.639
 how to increase profits from your closet 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.650
 without needing to buy anything I know it seems 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.860
 a dream but it is not 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.849
 are tips and tactics that I myself use in 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.070
 day by day 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.460
 So you do not have to keep repeating clothes. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.289
 or else in a different way it is a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 all day drama 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.539
 so come on, the first tip is to fold 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.130
 The house bar is so simple but I 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 I swear to you that it makes all the difference 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 seems to be in new pants 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 - I feel like there are some 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.020
 ways you can do this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.489
 for example if you fold up 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.570
 ankle in the famous fishing pants if I 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.360
 so the club's manager is a style 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 so a little more different and combines 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.550
 a lot with the shoes a little more 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.879
 male type sox put of other low fans 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.699
 even tennis shoes can also fold up to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.430
 half of the potato capri style is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.129
 the classic cover and it's a style that stays 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.810
 very uncluttered and it's great that the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 hotter days he was suffering from 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.520
 shock more hot wet to wear pants 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.150
 it is a middle ground so very good stay 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 great also with sandal but credo in the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.020
 my face from whom or from another dozen 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 because I thought it was very heavy 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.840
 this ethical composition the blouse with 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.840
 and the torn pants are the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 next tip become abuser win 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 I already talked about this on the blog I know 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.070
 that is not for everyone but it's still a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.950
 tactic so I use it every time I 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 Can I think it looks very cute? 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.320
 with the sewing looking like I think 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.210
 pull mine is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.390
 there are some things you are going to do are you 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.060
 need to see if the front 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.190
 provesso passes because they will be spending 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.290
 the same thing that abuses them on the name side 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.360
 It is also clear that the life of paints 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.369
 no one that is showing around does not 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.810
 If the whole idea is going to be delivered, 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.610
 with a retarded person than others 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.759
 English is a tip so it's different 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.640
 and I with you that for me the person 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 prizing that basic blouse on our 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 it makes life much easier 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.550
 The third tip is the best is to abuse 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.530
 button 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.270
 I think the one piece with more versatile 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.450
 but that you can have an area 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.070
 here I am wearing the classic blouse of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.620
 checkered flannel 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.540
 because I think it 's something that almost 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.670
 everyone has at home and has some 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.310
 ways you can use 12 button to 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.430
 first of all buttons 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 and the sleeve folded in the middle of the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.040
 Arm is beautiful, I prefer to use it 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.450
 braised button want more 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.390
 I think it got a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.459
 little is stripped to my style plus 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.680
 to do both with a sweater 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.410
 tight with a more loose blouse you 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.290
 you can also open the buttons and use a 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.350
 basic shirt underneath that I think 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.060
 That's great, great tip for that one. 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.850
 going to the movies is that you do not have to 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.950
 marry that matches that outfit and there 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.750
 get Kazakh solution you can still 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.870
 close that other tip that is 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.760
 Particularly, my favorite is you. 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.040
 To use a knife at my waist I think 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 gets very stripped out super 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.690
 Calm down to you. 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.720
 so it has more than one or even 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.630
 use or use more tidy to make a 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.090
 chic thing but what I love is 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.739
 that Lusa is no longer a piece of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.130
 clothing and becomes an accessory in the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.530
 plate composition of the enlarged one 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.200
 I got a rather tidy blouse. 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.690
 a button blouse even from the classic ones 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.849
 in call and checkered with print 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.150
 It is yellow and another way you can 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.280
 wear this blouse with the sleeves folded 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.830
 even called a wrist as if it were 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.350
 conducted without more formal 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.319
 only it is very differentiated by 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.459
 it is a sweater that usually does not fit 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.049
 use that way 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.980
 another thing you can do in this 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.860
 in this form of blouse is to bottle up 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.870
 the last button to use a collar like 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.970
 this one of pearls that I used I think 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.209
 one thing is a bit more chic with 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.070
 a jump from the level and finally the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.350
 The last way you can wear a shirt 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.979
 button is in disregard to the last two 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.990
 buttons and make a bow on it at the 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.720
 You can wear double sleeves tomorrow. 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.970
 open and long the whole country is going 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.419
 you are a very cool way to use 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.280
 blouse with a shorts pant central short I 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.229
 I think it makes the mid timer cahill that 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:45.640
 type of part is totally different 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.740
 neat and tidy at the same time and 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.590
 It's great and I hope you have 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.260
 liked the tips are tips that I myself 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.030
 use then type a thing as soon as I 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.550
 I like to do not need to stay 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.340
 repeating clothes and I wanted to dedicate it 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.990
 a video for joey and for paula that 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.840
 requested a video in this style more 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.479
 the fashion of how to use the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:13.050
 cabinet profile in a different way 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:13.050
 and that's strange here 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.400
 the video is subscribed to the channel and 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.560
 whether the last 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.990
 but it subscribes to the channel is very 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.449
 important for me and share your 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.850
