00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.020
 the wind waker is show if you 're with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 But it should not be a match for a short time 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.740
 disturb that is I think the map 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.470
 Driftwood coast or something like that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.380
 driftwood something and my second 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.369
 Free so a bit outward 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.369
 water I will be adjusted 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.610

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.950
 and out here, you know them 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 island again the people who wind themselves 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 waker gambled you realize that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.180
 again what is that this is the first one 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.180
 the one you start on the one on 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.250
 but you start 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.879
 mirrored yes that is there to do or 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 little link starts waking up and so and so on 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 the seagulls watching looks into the distance 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.479
 and dreamed of big adventure and yes 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.549
 that's the little easter egg I have to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.180
 times might look soon a picture purely 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.830
 or so in the video or you look 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.369
 Just google yourself the best 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.020
 And yes, as I said, that's the first one 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.490
 Anyway, India winners speak anyway 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.229
 so somehow just like that just stop 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 mirrored yes that was the little one 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.729
 crystal not so blatant now synonymous 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.560
 special but i lie people i think 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.600
