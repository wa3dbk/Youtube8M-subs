00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.029 
my feet will end up collapsing into this
bad<00:01:32.920> pattern<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.639> that<00:01:34.210> may<00:01:34.389> be<00:01:34.420> okay<00:01:34.929> as<00:01:35.319> I'm

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.620 
bad pattern and that may be okay as I'm
standing<00:01:36.490> around<00:01:36.609> and<00:01:36.999> I'm<00:01:37.060> able<00:01:37.179> to<00:01:37.359> be<00:01:37.569> able

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
standing around and I'm able to be able

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.660 
standing around and I'm able to be able
to<00:01:37.719> kind<00:01:37.869> of<00:01:37.990> buffer<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.679> bad<00:01:38.979> mechanic<00:01:39.219> but

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
to kind of buffer that bad mechanic but

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.359 
to kind of buffer that bad mechanic but
when<00:01:39.939> I<00:01:39.999> start<00:01:40.270> running<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.960> loading<00:01:41.859> my<00:01:42.069> feet

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
when I start running and loading my feet

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.069 
when I start running and loading my feet
and<00:01:42.579> start<00:01:42.789> collapsing<00:01:43.359> this<00:01:43.450> becomes<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.929> real

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
and start collapsing this becomes a real

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.870 
and start collapsing this becomes a real
problem<00:01:44.109> and<00:01:44.649> one<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.249> mechanisms<00:01:45.670> for<00:01:45.729> a

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
problem and one of the mechanisms for a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.340 
problem and one of the mechanisms for a
lot<00:01:45.999> of<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.179> foot<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.569> ankle<00:01:46.749> and<00:01:47.170> knee

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
lot of the foot and ankle and knee

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.319 
lot of the foot and ankle and knee
dysfunction<00:01:47.920> pathologies<00:01:48.789> that<00:01:48.819> we<00:01:49.030> tend<00:01:49.270> to

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
dysfunction pathologies that we tend to

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.849 
dysfunction pathologies that we tend to
see<00:01:49.509> in<00:01:49.600> runners<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.409> one<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.679> first

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
see in runners so one of the first

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.940 
see in runners so one of the first
things<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.069> we<00:01:51.189> can<00:01:51.340> work<00:01:51.549> on<00:01:51.819> is<00:01:52.299> sort<00:01:52.509> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
things that we can work on is sort of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.929 
things that we can work on is sort of
bearing<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.039> into<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.369> background<00:01:54.819> of<00:01:54.909> your

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
bearing this into the background of your

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.730 
bearing this into the background of your
day-to-day<00:01:55.329> activity<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.229> what<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.499> means

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
day-to-day activity so what that means

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.370 
day-to-day activity so what that means
is<00:01:56.920> are<00:01:57.100> my<00:01:57.310> feet<00:01:57.520> straight<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:59.049> have<00:01:59.289> my

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
is are my feet straight and I have my

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.499 
is are my feet straight and I have my
weight<00:01:59.590> evenly<00:01:59.979> distributed<00:02:00.490> once<00:02:01.119> I'm<00:02:01.299> there

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
weight evenly distributed once I'm there

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.749 
weight evenly distributed once I'm there
there's<00:02:02.289> one<00:02:02.319> more<00:02:02.679> piece<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.219> that<00:02:03.279> means<00:02:03.579> I

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
there's one more piece and that means I

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.359 
there's one more piece and that means I
need<00:02:04.029> to<00:02:04.329> create<00:02:04.719> torsion<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.950> foot<00:02:06.219> I

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
need to create torsion in the foot I

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.639 
need to create torsion in the foot I
need<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.850> be<00:02:06.939> able<00:02:07.029> to<00:02:07.149> think<00:02:07.719> about<00:02:07.869> screwing

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
need to be able to think about screwing

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.350 
need to be able to think about screwing
my<00:02:08.830> hips<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.520> feet<00:02:09.670> into<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.030> ground<00:02:10.240> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
my hips and feet into the ground a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.270 
my hips and feet into the ground a
little<00:02:10.450> bit<00:02:10.600> if<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.379> stay<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.680> my<00:02:11.830> feet<00:02:11.920> straight

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
little bit if I stay on my feet straight

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.979 
little bit if I stay on my feet straight
and<00:02:12.459> still<00:02:12.640> collapse<00:02:12.970> that's<00:02:13.689> slightly

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
and still collapse that's slightly

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.670 
and still collapse that's slightly
better<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.069> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.489> how<00:02:15.640> my<00:02:15.819> ankles

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
better but you can see how my ankles

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280 
better but you can see how my ankles
roll<00:02:16.769> in<00:02:17.040> my<00:02:17.849> arch<00:02:18.120> starts<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.780> lay<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.109> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
my heel my heel chords go from straight

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.849 
my heel my heel chords go from straight
up<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.269> down<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.750> starting<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> collapse<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
up and down to starting to collapse and

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.099 
up and down to starting to collapse and
pull<00:02:29.040> off<00:02:29.189> axis<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:30.329> is<00:02:30.480> difficult<00:02:30.659> for<00:02:30.930> the

one of the things that we have our

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670 
one of the things that we have our
athletes<00:02:35.969> do<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.930> their<00:02:37.079> standing<00:02:37.590> with

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
athletes do is is their standing with

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.649 
athletes do is is their standing with
their<00:02:37.799> feet<00:02:38.099> under<00:02:38.459> their<00:02:38.609> lungs<00:02:38.879> we<00:02:39.389> try<00:02:39.599> to

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
their feet under their lungs we try to

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.170 
their feet under their lungs we try to
screw<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.680> feet<00:02:40.889> into<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> ground<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
screw the feet into the ground just a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.849 
screw the feet into the ground just a
little<00:02:42.420> bit<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.139> screwed<00:02:43.409> my<00:02:43.500> feet<00:02:43.680> into<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
little bit if I screwed my feet into the

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:44.959 
little bit if I screwed my feet into the
ground<00:02:43.889> as<00:02:44.129> hard<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.609> could

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
ground as hard as I could

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.509 
ground as hard as I could
100%<00:02:45.840> I'd<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.230> creating<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> lot<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.859> force<00:02:47.280> I

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
100% I'd be creating a lot of force I

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.520 
100% I'd be creating a lot of force I
need<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.209> back<00:02:48.389> that<00:02:48.569> off<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.230> create<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
need just to back that off and create a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.319 
need just to back that off and create a
little<00:02:49.709> torsion<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.310> as<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.549> square<00:02:50.849> my<00:02:50.970> hips<00:02:51.180> in

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
little torsion so as I square my hips in

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.059 
little torsion so as I square my hips in
you'll<00:02:51.480> notice<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.780> my<00:02:51.900> arches<00:02:52.169> come<00:02:52.950> on

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
you'll notice that my arches come on

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.860 
you'll notice that my arches come on
line<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.909> musculature<00:02:54.299> my<00:02:54.510> feet<00:02:54.689> works

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
line and the musculature my feet works

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.420 
line and the musculature my feet works
better<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.290> suddenly<00:02:55.829> I'm<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.280> better

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
better and suddenly I'm in a better

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.059 
better and suddenly I'm in a better
position<00:02:56.609> so<00:02:57.419> homework<00:02:57.780> number<00:02:57.870> one<00:02:58.169> is<00:02:58.379> let's

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
position so homework number one is let's

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.009 
position so homework number one is let's
get<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.280> practicing<00:02:59.970> standing<00:03:00.689> in<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.870> better

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
get you practicing standing in a better

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.110 
get you practicing standing in a better
position<00:03:01.169> you<00:03:01.919> can<00:03:02.069> do<00:03:02.159> this<00:03:02.340> barefoot<00:03:02.549> but

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
position you can do this barefoot but

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.940 
position you can do this barefoot but
you<00:03:03.209> can<00:03:03.299> also<00:03:03.480> practice<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.139> in<00:03:04.290> any<00:03:04.650> shoe

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you can also practice this in any shoe

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.319 
you can also practice this in any shoe
that<00:03:05.129> you're<00:03:05.250> wearing<00:03:05.459> during<00:03:05.969> the<00:03:06.060> course<00:03:06.269> of
