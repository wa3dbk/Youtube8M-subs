00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
through and it is the same this time and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.440 
through and it is the same this time and
the<00:03:34.169> bug<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.310> not<00:03:35.519> there<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.269> not

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.089 
the bug just it's not there it is not
there<00:03:36.660> what<00:03:36.870> mega<00:03:37.079> medicham<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.889> field

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
there what mega medicham is on the field

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.280 
there what mega medicham is on the field
so<00:03:38.819> Evan<00:03:39.419> comes<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.840> pretty<00:03:39.989> much<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.200> only

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
so Evan comes in pretty much the only

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.750 
so Evan comes in pretty much the only
thing<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.769> actually<00:03:40.919> do<00:03:41.190> anything<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.639> my

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
there's a lot of things that can happen

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.360

no<00:03:47.459> real<00:03:47.669> counters<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.329> on<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.630> team

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
no real counters for it on this team

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.390 
no real counters for it on this team
right<00:03:48.930> now<00:03:48.989> since<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> substitute<00:03:50.250> up

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
right now since I have the substitute up

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.909 
right now since I have the substitute up
I<00:03:50.639> cannot<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.450> could<00:03:51.750> take<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.959> hit<00:03:52.169> I<00:03:52.410> could<00:03:52.769> take

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
I cannot I could take a hit I could take

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.170 
I cannot I could take a hit I could take
that<00:03:53.040> very<00:03:53.190> nicely<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.000> know<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
that very nicely because you know it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.199 
that very nicely because you know it
substitute<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.220> Evan<00:03:56.220> was<00:03:56.579> actually<00:03:56.970> able<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
substitute and Evan was actually able to

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.930 
substitute and Evan was actually able to
survive<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.840> head<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:59.280> know<00:03:59.400> kudos<00:03:59.760> to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
survive the head so you know kudos to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.250 
survive the head so you know kudos to
Evan<00:04:00.239> even<00:04:00.690> though<00:04:00.750> Evan<00:04:00.959> doesn't<00:04:01.049> really

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
Evan even though Evan doesn't really

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.220 
Evan even though Evan doesn't really
have<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.470> great<00:04:01.970> defense<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.569> did<00:04:03.959> match<00:04:04.079> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
have that great defense it did match to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.449 
have that great defense it did match to
take<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.530> maybe<00:04:04.650> he's<00:04:04.799> got<00:04:04.859> some<00:04:05.040> defensive

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
take it maybe he's got some defensive

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.030 
take it maybe he's got some defensive
v's<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.030> there<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.989> hear<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.889> some

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
v's and there but I hear this is some

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.159 
v's and there but I hear this is some
something<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.549> wasn't<00:04:08.730> expecting<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.480> quick

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
something I wasn't expecting the quick

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.259 
something I wasn't expecting the quick
attack<00:04:10.470> d<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.579> pixelate<00:04:12.090> cook

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
attack d I think it's pixelate cook

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.220 
attack d I think it's pixelate cook
attack<00:04:12.480> because<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.870> was<00:04:12.959> super<00:04:13.169> effective

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
attack because that was super effective

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.589 
attack because that was super effective
so<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.519> actually<00:04:14.730> something<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.419> really

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
so that is actually something I really

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.120 
so that is actually something I really
didn't<00:04:15.840> expect<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.380> did<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> lot<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:16.889> damage

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
didn't expect and I did a lot of damage

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.069 
didn't expect and I did a lot of damage
to<00:04:17.250> poor<00:04:17.519> medicham<00:04:17.910> as<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.449> can<00:04:18.539> see<00:04:18.660> medicham

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
to poor medicham as you can see medicham

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.319 
to poor medicham as you can see medicham
has<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.320> pretty<00:04:19.889> low<00:04:20.099> defense<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:21.239> that

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
has a pretty low defense is not that

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
proper team and that did go a little bit

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.610 
proper team and that did go a little bit
better<00:05:53.580> on<00:05:53.730> on<00:05:54.330> his<00:05:54.690> party<00:05:54.990> goes<00:05:55.140> Sableye<00:05:55.560> the

better on on his party goes Sableye the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.130 
better on on his party goes Sableye the
Swampert<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:57.090> Brella<00:05:57.330> Mike<00:05:57.570> I<00:05:57.690> did<00:05:57.900> then

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
Swampert the the Brella Mike I did then

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.990 
Swampert the the Brella Mike I did then
the<00:05:58.230> Rotom<00:05:58.500> cut<00:05:58.920> I<00:05:58.950> think<00:05:59.340> which<00:05:59.730> is<00:05:59.760> kind<00:05:59.970> of

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
the Rotom cut I think which is kind of

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.040 
the Rotom cut I think which is kind of
interesting<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.390> don't<00:06:00.510> really<00:06:00.660> see<00:06:00.780> much<00:06:00.990> of

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
interesting you don't really see much of

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.800 
interesting you don't really see much of
that<00:06:01.260> but<00:06:01.860> um<00:06:02.010> it<00:06:02.310> did<00:06:02.490> end<00:06:02.730> with<00:06:03.300> me<00:06:03.480> winning

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
that but um it did end with me winning

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.800 
that but um it did end with me winning
again<00:06:04.110> i<00:06:04.140> think<00:06:04.290> it<00:06:04.500> was<00:06:04.590> 30<00:06:05.190> or<00:06:05.490> 20<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:06.720> was

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
again i think it was 30 or 20 so it was

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.570 
again i think it was 30 or 20 so it was
a<00:06:06.870> little<00:06:06.990> bit<00:06:07.170> better<00:06:07.320> medicham<00:06:08.160> didn't

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
a little bit better medicham didn't

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.760 
a little bit better medicham didn't
sweep<00:06:08.820> again<00:06:09.120> so<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:09.810> there<00:06:10.140> are<00:06:10.320> some

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
sweep again so it there are some

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.280 
sweep again so it there are some
counters<00:06:11.190> doing<00:06:11.400> about<00:06:11.550> a<00:06:11.610> champ<00:06:11.820> but<00:06:12.030> um<00:06:12.290> not

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
counters doing about a champ but um not

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.800 
counters doing about a champ but um not
on<00:06:13.320> that<00:06:13.560> team<00:06:13.740> not<00:06:14.670> on<00:06:14.820> that<00:06:14.970> team<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:15.690> i<00:06:15.720> just

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
on that team not on that team so i just

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.030 
on that team not on that team so i just
want<00:06:16.050> to<00:06:16.110> show<00:06:16.260> it<00:06:16.320> off<00:06:16.380> just<00:06:16.560> because<00:06:16.740> you
