00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:19.870
 because it was with beauty that counts back 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.610
 For another video, all of you. 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.940
 In the video today, I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.210
 that the producer spoke among the differences 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.039
 bs-4 and xbox one right before 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.199
 Look at what he says I mean the 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.149
 You who are still in the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.910
 beginning of the new generation of the eighth generation 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.920
 ps four explosions and always has a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.559
 people on the side of the producer and 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.720
 other side of the other in the case of the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.030
 ps4 other side the xbox 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.350
 sometimes one that sits on the side of one or 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.270
 of another that has not even caught the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.450
 hired generation is already talking badly 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.610
 face first with that 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.960
 business was lyricism fanboys I did not 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.980
 and there are people who talk to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.020
 shareholders 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.010
 so here is the side of the sony 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.199
 playstation 2 playstation and a case 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.329
 when the person is a smallholder shareholder 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.409
 you shareholder in case they all speak 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.540
 the shareholders 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.840
 You speak badly, you just show 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.900
 playstation and strength xbox xbox and olive 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.150
 or if not who is kxf on the xbox side 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.420
 speak badly of who has playstation and xbox 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.350
 it is the best for this business each one 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.799
 have your opinion 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.470
 Some people say that who 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.540
 understand ps4 xbox speak ill of it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.820
 does not have that exclusive for the first time 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.220
 instead what control is better the ones that is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.470
 Cxita says that xbox is better when 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.960
 s4 compared to the control is better 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.390
 exclusive of xbox is expensive for this 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.860
 first each one has is each one has 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 your opinion to choose what you want 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.020
 each console goes from the person's taste 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.329
 the exclusive ones that each one has its father 41 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.280
 exclusive of it pleases you more with more 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.259
 four dude I do not have a business 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.299
 fanboy was swallowed we talk that the 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.369
 bus has nothing to extension 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.860
 only that xbox or will still talk with 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.509
 headphones ship also has no 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.790
 nothing made three headphones or not 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.799
 despite the xbox live that I most have 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.329
 The game is because there are people who 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.370
 work just to make it clearer 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.680
 request 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.299
 find it more expensive now I got told 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.440
 talk that the producer here talks about 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:23.019
 this war is between ps and xbox van and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.670
 his views on the games is to put 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.959
 the more advanced the more you earn the more 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.739
 cheap and such 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.260
 Anyway, let's go with the big difference. 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.290
 between 4 ps xbox year 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.420
 The war between the ps4 xbox one is still 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.780
 in the initial phase between the producers 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 they are to start and they are 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.849
 revealing some opinions about this 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.859
 battle between sony and microsoft is in 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.379
 In recent months much has been said about 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:54.730
 processing power and resolutions 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:58.750
 is more according to alex producer of lost org 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.150
 and remember the pixel penalties 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.239
 it's what matters really is the game it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.609
 He spoke as a producer, not if he did not want to. 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.950
 tell which one is the best the best 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.359
 console because I had to 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.730
 opportunity to work only with the 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.750
 ps4 he just had the opportunity 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.660
 to work with ps4 interview with 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 game bout was an incredible experience and 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.459
 support from independent studio and 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.280
 really fantastic we are anxious 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.950
 to publish lost orge other 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.959
 giving platforms is the opportunity to 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.500
 to work with the new records 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.109
 because that's the way he says it 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.859
 our orb and advance only to 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.810
 past generation did not go here just to 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.959
 the pc iphone ipad and android 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.970
 only he now talked about launching this 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.010
 game for the exclusive consoles for the 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.400
 new generation because the brain console 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.530
 supports a lot and such he explains is 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.530
 so let's see the differences and can not 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.419
 have a country four cool about it right? 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.900
 It's because he has both of them , he explains. 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:08.139
 that he speaks as a player has always been a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.849
 fan of nintendo and sony but i bought 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.709
 all the platforms of the last 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.379
 generations to me he said that he 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.449
 always been more of your idea is sony and 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.750
 of nintendo but the last generations it 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.969
 It was all me and he said it to me 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.130
 me the games have a fundamental role 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.889
 every console has always had at least 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.469
 two clubs 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.460
 be better than the one who could not 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:30.710
 to run away 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.590
 every day is of every platform to have 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.080
 for this reason it is true that the 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.999
 differences for me are the games and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.779
 best platforms is that the titles 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:43.460
 I want to play but this both sony 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.169
 as Microsoft is making a big 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.490
 work to secure their titles 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.499
 English and other genres is to provide 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.629
 unique experiences for your fans 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:56.840
 he said something really true 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:05:00.199
 each producer has a focus tell if a 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.180
 focus an audi such a microsoft has a 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.460
 unique and always tries to reach the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.159
 of this exclusive that many people 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.650
 will buy a console must buy 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.449
 console more by the exclusive sometimes 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.069
 look control and such but the console 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.110
 people look more in terms of 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.629
 more graphical graphics between ps4 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.639
 next generation does not have much of a 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.259
 difference if you have an express I think 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.479
 that it does not make any difference the play 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.150
 four boxes thanks to them are the same 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.550
 only ps4 that has better rule more 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.529
 graphics two are the same thing does not stay 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.259
 with this on the head and the 4 graphic opway 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.969
 best xbox live has a better graphic 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.699
 none of this graphic of them are the same 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.659
 thing then the person is thinking the 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.879
 what to buy 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:43.819
 and it is one of the first two type the person 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:46.639
 will look straight into them the exclusive 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.069
 control and then the producer the focus 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.899
 them is always trying to look at 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.089
 unique you have to improve to 

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.520
 to draw more attention to the person 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.379
 be able to pick up this console and use 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.789
 understood this is fact is that the person 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.669
 always when buying a console from 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.169
 new generation and such will always look more 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.909
 exclusive then it really is what the 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.659
 microsoft sony producer have to look 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:11.300
 to be able to always leave more at the peak 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.490
 tried to make a better person for it 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.620
 was choose chose what you have in 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.149
 her opinion it's like it does not know if 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.349
 I'll explain at the right night but it's more or 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:19.759
 less in this and lion 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.129
 I, for example, when I went to buy my 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:26.180
 ps4 is able to get cold 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:27.650
 I bought it but because it's because 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.930
 I do not know why I think it was proof. 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.479
 even though it was not much it was not 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.370
 completed because of the control that 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.990
 pleased a few other things 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.669
 also that Japan remembered much more 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.710
 I knew the ps to launch one of the 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.350
 speeches and tried to get a 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.789
 bad first but xbox also has 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.009
 their advantages then each has a 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.550
 way in the opinion of choosing what 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.979
 would you like 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.690
 between which console you want to understand then 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.160
 It is this guys I wanted to talk this 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.470
 video with you 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.870
 sure is the producer talked about the 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.560
 great differences between ps patrick 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.330
 baumann 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.949
 I said that a little about mine. 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.770
 opinion on this too 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.509
 This is not a fiesta, war is always going to have 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.940
 they consume between them and such 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.370
 but what would kill me of anger a cake smo 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.810
 one who has 1 and speaks badly of the other has the 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.610
 another speaks ill of the other 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.440
 Now stop it, everyone has an opinion. 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.389
 to choose which one you like what you like 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.740
 but what pleases most does not have this 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.090
 to say that it is better that the other does not 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.080
 Brazil bought is the xbox and the other is the ps4 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.849
 prove that he wanted it liked 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.930
 But I do not understand, I understand . 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.720
 stay talking 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.919
 The fourth best opway such gift is 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.449
 basically this 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.400
 So people are no more, that's what they'll do. 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.860
 If you argue the dollar is looking 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.419
 They look more at me here to help me, said 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.400
 that on social networks facebook twitter 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.830
 the links are all those that are from 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.260
 3d video of the project stay connected south and 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.260
 said and even more 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.260
 went
