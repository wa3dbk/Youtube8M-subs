into what's inside the box I'll show you
the<00:04:46.790> inside<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:48.700> we<00:04:49.700> still<00:04:49.850> get<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:49.970> Power

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
the inside of it we still get the Power

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.960 
the inside of it we still get the Power
Core<00:04:50.570> here<00:04:50.840> here's<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.410> controller<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.610> it

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
Core here here's the controller and it

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.500 
Core here here's the controller and it
Kamath<00:04:53.390> eats<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:55.000> not<00:04:56.000> really<00:04:56.180> sure<00:04:56.360> if<00:04:56.420> these

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
Kamath eats and not really sure if these

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.240 
Kamath eats and not really sure if these
are<00:04:56.720> rare<00:04:56.930> or<00:04:56.960> not<00:04:57.260> if<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.560> came<00:04:57.770> with<00:04:57.830> every

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
are rare or not if it came with every

Atari or not

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.120 
Atari or not
you<00:04:59.690> basically<00:04:59.870> just<00:05:00.200> place<00:05:00.560> them<00:05:00.740> on<00:05:00.830> top<00:05:01.010> of

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
you basically just place them on top of

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.580 
you basically just place them on top of
the<00:05:01.190> controller<00:05:01.610> gives<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:03.020> your<00:05:03.230> it's

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
the controller gives you is your it's

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.740 
the controller gives you is your it's
like<00:05:03.740> really<00:05:04.310> cool<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.670> use<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:05.090> with<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.390> you

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
like really cool just use it with it you

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.670 
like really cool just use it with it you
know<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.320> get<00:05:06.440> more<00:05:06.500> on<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.570> stability<00:05:08.570> on<00:05:09.560> your

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
know you get more on a stability on your

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.820 
know you get more on a stability on your
controller<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:11.480> like<00:05:12.230> these<00:05:12.440> look<00:05:12.650> brand-new

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
controller and like these look brand-new

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.890 
controller and like these look brand-new
there's<00:05:13.520> still<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.940> original<00:05:14.030> twisty<00:05:14.720> ties

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
there's still the original twisty ties

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.750 
there's still the original twisty ties
on<00:05:15.290> them<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:16.660> got<00:05:17.660> two<00:05:17.960> of<00:05:18.140> these<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.680> got<00:05:19.310> three

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
on them I got two of these I got three

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.140 
on them I got two of these I got three
controllers<00:05:20.270> here<00:05:20.770> this<00:05:21.770> one<00:05:22.040> I<00:05:22.400> don't<00:05:23.030> really

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
controllers here this one I don't really

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.690 
controllers here this one I don't really
know<00:05:23.360> why<00:05:23.600> has<00:05:23.930> this<00:05:24.170> orange<00:05:25.160> thing<00:05:25.430> going

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
know why has this orange thing going

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.230 
know why has this orange thing going
around<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:27.770> uh<00:05:28.000> might<00:05:29.000> have<00:05:29.030> been<00:05:29.210> a

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
around it but uh might have been a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.450 
around it but uh might have been a
controller<00:05:29.600> that<00:05:29.660> came<00:05:29.960> with<00:05:30.140> it<00:05:30.290> first<00:05:30.620> but<00:05:31.190> I

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
controller that came with it first but I

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.170 
controller that came with it first but I
got<00:05:31.910> two<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.240> these<00:05:32.360> go<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.290> it<00:05:34.030> now<00:05:35.030> if<00:05:35.090> you

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
got two of these go on it now if you

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.790 
got two of these go on it now if you
look<00:05:35.300> at<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.480> inside<00:05:35.900> that's<00:05:36.170> moving<00:05:36.560> place

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
look at the inside that's moving place

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.570 
look at the inside that's moving place
the<00:05:38.620> game<00:05:39.730> show<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:40.790> guys<00:05:41.030> I'll<00:05:41.330> grab<00:05:41.600> the
