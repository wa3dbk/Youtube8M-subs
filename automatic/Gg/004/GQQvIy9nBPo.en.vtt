00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
okay so basically after you watch the

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.740 
okay so basically after you watch the
gameplay<00:01:08.650> demo<00:01:09.070> there's<00:01:09.790> this<00:01:09.970> little<00:01:10.299> bit

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
gameplay demo there's this little bit

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.749 
gameplay demo there's this little bit
where<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.020> see<00:01:11.290> all<00:01:11.320> these<00:01:11.530> weird<00:01:12.070> lines<00:01:12.549> of

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
where you see all these weird lines of

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.719 
where you see all these weird lines of
code<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:14.830> first<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.189> thought<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.520> lines

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
code at first I thought that the lines

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.050 
code at first I thought that the lines
of<00:01:15.850> code<00:01:16.090> with<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.680> file<00:01:17.680> type<00:01:17.979> Anna<00:01:18.340> my<00:01:18.729> I

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
of code with the file type Anna my I

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.999 
of code with the file type Anna my I
thought<00:01:19.900> that<00:01:20.049> they<00:01:20.140> were<00:01:20.229> actually<00:01:20.350> youtube

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
thought that they were actually youtube

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.679 
thought that they were actually youtube
video<00:01:21.310> links<00:01:21.820> is<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.540> have<00:01:22.659> to

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
video links is that you have to

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.929 
video links is that you have to
carefully<00:01:23.650> edit<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.100> part<00:01:24.310> where<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.579> were

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
carefully edit the part where you were

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
carefully edit the part where you were
going<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.119> put<00:01:25.210> into<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.600> YouTube<00:01:26.200> bar<00:01:26.470> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
going to put into the YouTube bar I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.280 
going to put into the YouTube bar I
tried<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:27.939> for<00:01:28.150> about<00:01:28.240> an<00:01:28.420> hour<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.689> realized

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
tried that for about an hour I realized

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
tried that for about an hour I realized
that<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.530> was<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.710> dud<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:30.880> my<00:01:31.149> theory<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that I was a dud so my theory that that

was<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.159> complete<00:01:36.610> dud<00:01:37.560> after<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.710> there<00:01:39.340> is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
was a complete dud after that there is

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.330 
was a complete dud after that there is
this<00:01:39.549> hex<00:01:39.939> code<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.509> just<00:01:40.689> barely<00:01:41.619> stays<00:01:42.130> on

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
this hex code that just barely stays on

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.760 
this hex code that just barely stays on
screen<00:01:42.700> for<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> millisecond<00:01:43.390> before<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.530> fades

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
screen for a millisecond before it fades

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.749 
screen for a millisecond before it fades
out

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.830 

didn't<00:01:49.759> see<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:49.969> okay<00:01:50.450> let's<00:01:50.659> try<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.960> again

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.529 

okay<00:01:56.840> here<00:01:57.079> I'm<00:01:57.229> gonna<00:01:57.350> slow<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.619> down<00:01:57.770> for<00:01:58.100> you

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
okay here I'm gonna slow it down for you

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.149 
okay here I'm gonna slow it down for you
bingo<00:01:59.539> that's<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.319> hex<00:02:03.530> code<00:02:03.829> so

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
bingo that's it so it's a hex code so

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.520 
bingo that's it so it's a hex code so
why<00:02:04.459> did<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:04.939> I<00:02:05.509> ran<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.869> hex<00:02:06.049> code<00:02:06.140> through<00:02:06.439> an

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
why did is I ran the hex code through an

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.279 
why did is I ran the hex code through an
online<00:02:06.709> translator<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.939> sure<00:02:08.810> enough<00:02:08.840> my

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
online translator and sure enough my

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.229 
online translator and sure enough my
hunch<00:02:09.709> was<00:02:09.799> right<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.819> it's<00:02:11.120> a

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
hunch was right there is it's a

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.539 
hunch was right there is it's a
legitimate<00:02:11.629> message<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.379> secret<00:02:12.890> message<00:02:13.129> and

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
legitimate message a secret message and

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.600 
legitimate message a secret message and
