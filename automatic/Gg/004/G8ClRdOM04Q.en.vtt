easy<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.760> defend<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.360> tell<00:02:24.510> already<00:02:24.660> like

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.870 

obviously<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.100> says<00:02:29.250> make<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> little<00:02:29.700> bit<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
obviously it says make a little bit of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.729 
obviously it says make a little bit of
noise<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.980> your<00:02:31.980> stuff<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:34.410> can

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
noise but your stuff like that I can

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.050 
noise but your stuff like that I can
cover<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:35.070> von<00:02:35.250> pretty<00:02:35.489> well<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.730> well<00:02:35.850> just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.069 
cover be von pretty well as well just
sitting<00:02:36.329> here<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> seems<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.780> it'd<00:02:36.900> be<00:02:37.049> a

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
sitting here it seems like it'd be a

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.490 
sitting here it seems like it'd be a
good<00:02:37.230> periods<00:02:37.560> fun<00:02:38.900> there<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:39.959> go<00:02:40.079> let's<00:02:40.350> go

good periods fun there we go let's go

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.240 
good periods fun there we go let's go
baby<00:02:41.600> round<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:43.380> I've<00:02:43.500> noticed<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.010> game

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
baby round be I've noticed in this game

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.800 
baby round be I've noticed in this game
on<00:02:44.400> certain<00:02:44.700> maps<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.269> can<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.540> cover<00:02:45.660> them

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
on certain maps you can just cover them

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.120 
on certain maps you can just cover them
both<00:02:46.019> at<00:02:46.140> once<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.769> can<00:02:46.950> see<00:02:47.040> i'm

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
both at once like as you can see i'm

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.560 
both at once like as you can see i'm
covering<00:02:47.400> bee<00:02:47.549> balm<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> most<00:02:48.120> part<00:02:48.329> i

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
covering bee balm for the most part i

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.390 
covering bee balm for the most part i
can't<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> entire<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> bomb<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.250> can

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
can't see the entire a bomb but I can

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.670 
can't see the entire a bomb but I can
kind<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.700> cover<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.239> know<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:52.079> just<00:02:52.110> stuff

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
kind of cover you know and just stuff

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.319 
kind of cover you know and just stuff
like<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.250> seems<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.090> easy

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
like that it seems like it's really easy

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.050 
like that it seems like it's really easy
to<00:02:54.450> cover<00:02:54.660> both<00:02:54.840> bombs<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.680> once<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.790> get<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
to cover both bombs but once you get the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.729 
to cover both bombs but once you get the
bomb<00:02:57.209> down<00:02:57.450> games<00:02:57.870> over<00:02:58.110> that's<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.650> it

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
bomb down games over that's what it

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.000 
bomb down games over that's what it
seems<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.360> if<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.570> have<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.959> good<00:03:01.110> spot<00:03:01.380> when

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
seems like if you have a good spot when

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.100 
seems like if you have a good spot when
you're<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> good<00:03:02.459> lap<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:03.510> especially<00:03:03.900> on

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
you're a good lap like especially on

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.599 
you're a good lap like especially on
this<00:03:04.230> map<00:03:04.410> there's<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.950> many<00:03:05.130> spots<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.579> can

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
this map there's so many spots you can

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.539 
this map there's so many spots you can
see<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> ball<00:03:06.000> man<00:03:06.209> especially<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.519> it's<00:03:08.519> hard

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
see the ball man especially a it's hard

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.920

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.230

probably<00:04:22.620> equally<00:04:23.010> as<00:04:23.190> nasty<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:23.790> we're<00:04:23.910> up

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
probably equally as nasty but we're up

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.370

for<00:04:24.240> right<00:04:24.540> now<00:04:24.570> we<00:04:24.720> got<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> nice<00:04:24.990> little<00:04:25.200> lead

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380

for right now we got a nice little lead
going<00:04:25.590> here<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.479> pretty<00:04:27.479> soon<00:04:27.630> I'm<00:04:27.750> thinking

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
going here and pretty soon I'm thinking

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.719 
going here and pretty soon I'm thinking
about<00:04:28.050> getting<00:04:28.229> in<00:04:28.410> some<00:04:28.590> wagers<00:04:28.770> not<00:04:29.130> nothing

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729

big maybe some 250 s and stuff you know
just<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.870> kind<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.140> get<00:04:34.290> used<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> game

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
just just kind of get used to the game

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.020 
just just kind of get used to the game
because<00:04:37.410> like<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.950> really<00:04:38.580> don't<00:04:38.729> like<00:04:38.820> playing
