and welcome to some DCU Oh

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.820 
and welcome to some DCU Oh
so<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.699> little<00:00:21.570> segment<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.740> I

so for this little segment here like I
said<00:00:23.039> before<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:24.390> gonna<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> quick<00:00:25.350> video

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
said before I was gonna do a quick video

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.640 
said before I was gonna do a quick video
on<00:00:26.189> some<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> move<00:00:27.150> sets<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:27.779> quantum

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
on some of the move sets from quantum

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.519 
on some of the move sets from quantum
once<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.949> hit<00:00:29.039> level<00:00:29.369> 30<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.320> one

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
once you hit level 30 so for this one

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.600 
once you hit level 30 so for this one
here<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.149> want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.300> through<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.870> time<00:00:34.610> our

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
here I want to go through the time our

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.910 
here I want to go through the time our
power<00:00:35.880> set<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.530> check<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.829> out

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
power set so go up here and check it out

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.540 
power set so go up here and check it out
real<00:00:38.100> quick<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.480> them<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.840> my<00:00:40.170> time

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
real quick so I have them all on my time

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
real quick so I have them all on my time
in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.790> time<00:00:42.149> power<00:00:42.420> set<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.739> won't<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
in the time power set so I won't have to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
in the time power set so I won't have to
switch<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.980> anyways<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
switch them out as we go but anyways I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.180 
switch them out as we go but anyways I
want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> show<00:00:49.020> off<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> few<00:00:49.559> move<00:00:49.800> sets

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
want to just show off a few move sets

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.410 
want to just show off a few move sets
and<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.789> looked<00:00:50.969> pretty<00:00:51.030> cool<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:52.520> some<00:00:53.520> things

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and it looked pretty cool to some things

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.549 
and it looked pretty cool to some things
like<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> look<00:00:55.050> pretty<00:00:55.230> cool<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like that I look pretty cool like a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.720 
like that I look pretty cool like a
teleportation<00:00:56.270> this<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.710> who<00:00:58.710> energy<00:00:59.219> ball<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
teleportation this one who energy ball I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
teleportation this one who energy ball I
look<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.030> tight<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.049> what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
look pretty tight and I don't know what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.880 
look pretty tight and I don't know what
that<00:01:04.320> does<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.920> does<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.489> damage<00:01:06.890> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that does but does little damage that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
that does but does little damage that
pretty<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.810> decent<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.880> which<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.650> R

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
pretty pretty decent and which one my R

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.700 
pretty pretty decent and which one my R
2<00:01:13.920> squared<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
2 squared and I don't know what that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.420 
2 squared and I don't know what that
does<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.189> read<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.549> real<00:01:17.700> quick<00:01:19.430> time

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
does let's go read that real quick time

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.460 
does let's go read that real quick time
which<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
which one was that one the one with the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.260 
which one was that one the one with the
fist<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.700> oh<00:01:24.560> okay<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> power

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
fist this one oh okay that's the power

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
fist this one oh okay that's the power
resource<00:01:27.270> power<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:28.680> team<00:01:29.400> our<00:01:29.759> team

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
resource power to your team our team

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.109 
resource power to your team our team
members<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:32.670> way<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
members so that way you don't have to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:33.620 
members so that way you don't have to
worry<00:01:33.329> too<00:01:33.479> much

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
worry too much

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.039 
worry too much
unless<00:01:33.840> you're<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.400> controller<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.049> he's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
unless you're a controller so he's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.560 
unless you're a controller so he's
showing<00:01:37.110> off<00:01:37.500> moves<00:01:37.799> too<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
showing off moves too you see that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.200 
showing off moves too you see that
anyways

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
anyways

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.390 
anyways
there<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.810> go<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.260> I'm<00:01:42.920> gonna<00:01:43.040> switch<00:01:43.220> out

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
there you go and I'm gonna switch out

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.670 
there you go and I'm gonna switch out
these<00:01:43.610> low<00:01:44.360> that's<00:01:44.540> real<00:01:44.720> quick<00:01:44.960> here<00:01:45.260> I<00:01:45.440> gotta

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
these low that's real quick here I gotta

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.970 
these low that's real quick here I gotta
wait<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.100> second<00:01:46.430> until<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:48.350> thing<00:01:48.560> calms

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
wait for a second until this thing calms

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.430 
wait for a second until this thing calms
down<00:01:49.070> talk<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:50.090> could<00:01:50.300> so<00:01:50.480> I'm<00:01:50.900> still<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.320> a

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
down talk I could so I'm still in a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.900 
down talk I could so I'm still in a
attack<00:01:52.040> mode<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.580> okay<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:53.380> we're<00:01:54.380> back<00:01:54.560> and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
attack mode so okay so we're back and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.970 
attack mode so okay so we're back and
it's<00:01:55.910> finally<00:01:56.090> got<00:01:56.300> off<00:01:56.540> of<00:01:56.570> my<00:01:56.840> attack<00:01:57.470> mode

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's finally got off of my attack mode

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.000 
it's finally got off of my attack mode
and<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.270> switch<00:02:00.260> out<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> moves<00:02:00.740> here<00:02:00.920> real

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
and so I switch out the moves here real

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.210 
and so I switch out the moves here real
quick<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.550> these<00:02:01.850> ones<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.620> got<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.770> ones<00:02:03.980> that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
quick for these ones I got the ones that

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.250 
quick for these ones I got the ones that
are<00:02:04.310> still<00:02:04.400> on<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.640> bottom<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:06.020> then

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
are still on the bottom here and then

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.800 
are still on the bottom here and then
I'll<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.560> quick<00:02:06.830> cook<00:02:07.250> cut<00:02:07.820> away<00:02:08.030> when<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:08.690> go

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
I'll do a quick cook cut away when we go

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.000 
I'll do a quick cook cut away when we go
into<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.380> space<00:02:09.850> power<00:02:10.850> set<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.830> do

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
into the space power set so that I do

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.260 
into the space power set so that I do
everything<00:02:13.160> rights<00:02:13.720> should<00:02:14.720> be<00:02:14.750> able<00:02:15.190> yep

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
everything rights should be able yep

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.199 
everything rights should be able yep
okay<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:17.330> I'm<00:02:17.510> gonna<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.959> wrists<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
okay so I'm gonna do the wrists here and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.740 
okay so I'm gonna do the wrists here and
l2<00:02:23.209> triangle<00:02:23.690> oh<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.280> bubble<00:02:25.790> so

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
l2 triangle oh this is like a bubble so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.330 
l2 triangle oh this is like a bubble so
it's<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> shield<00:02:27.320> pretty<00:02:27.650> much<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:31.250> was

pretty<00:02:31.520> cool<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.820> looks<00:02:31.970> like<00:02:32.090> some<00:02:32.240> kind<00:02:32.450> of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
pretty cool it looks like some kind of

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.070 
pretty cool it looks like some kind of
like<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.920> know<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.580> goes<00:02:35.150> into<00:02:35.570> them<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.780> it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
like you know it goes into them that it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.199 
like you know it goes into them that it
I<00:02:36.320> don't<00:02:36.470> know<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.680> kind<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.430> comes<00:02:38.030> out

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
I don't know it just kind of comes out

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.270 
I don't know it just kind of comes out
in<00:02:38.390> spreads<00:02:39.020> around<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.350> shoots<00:02:39.560> them<00:02:39.709> at

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
in spreads around and shoots them at

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.500 
in spreads around and shoots them at
first<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.580> was<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.910> hell<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.450> was

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
first I was like what the hell it was

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.030 
first I was like what the hell it was
like<00:02:41.690> some<00:02:41.900> kind<00:02:42.020> of<00:02:42.110> delay<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.890> guess

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
like some kind of delay but I guess

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040 
like some kind of delay but I guess
that's<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.310> move<00:02:43.520> set<00:02:43.730> that's<00:02:44.690> how<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.840> looks

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
that's the move set that's how it looks

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.000 
that's the move set that's how it looks
and<00:02:45.440> then<00:02:45.980> here's<00:02:46.190> our<00:02:46.340> Kamehameha<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:48.010> it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
and then here's our Kamehameha and it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.520 
and then here's our Kamehameha and it
looks<00:02:49.160> freaking<00:02:49.730> Bruce<00:02:50.000> that's<00:02:50.330> pretty<00:02:50.750> good

let's<00:04:45.400> finish<00:04:45.610> up<00:04:45.849> with<00:04:46.240> our<00:04:46.590> quantum<00:04:47.590> power

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
let's finish up with our quantum power

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.180 
let's finish up with our quantum power
showcase<00:04:49.240> for<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.409> know<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.620> power<00:04:50.830> set

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
showcase for the you know the power set

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.640 
showcase for the you know the power set
so<00:04:51.400> let's<00:04:52.120> take<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.599> look<00:04:52.780> at<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.500> know<00:04:53.590> the

so let's take a look at you know the
first<00:04:54.010> two<00:04:54.430> supercharged<00:04:55.389> gear<00:04:56.669> this<00:04:57.669> one's

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
first two supercharged gear this one's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.689 
first two supercharged gear this one's
my<00:04:57.970> favorite<00:04:58.000> one<00:04:58.389> yeah<00:04:59.020> just<00:04:59.680> all<00:05:00.340> had<00:05:00.669> a

my favorite one yeah just all had a

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.600 
my favorite one yeah just all had a
damage<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.659> it<00:05:02.289> has<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.409> lot<00:05:02.650> of<00:05:02.680> range<00:05:02.949> too<00:05:03.340> so

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
damage and it has a lot of range too so

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.240 
damage and it has a lot of range too so
as<00:05:03.849> you<00:05:03.970> see<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.479> also<00:05:04.659> hit<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.680> grungy<00:05:06.070> over

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
as you see it also hit the grungy over

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.160 
as you see it also hit the grungy over
here<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:08.110> anyways<00:05:08.680> let's<00:05:08.979> do<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.190> one

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
here but anyways let's do this one

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.840 
here but anyways let's do this one
and<00:05:12.170> what<00:05:12.530> does<00:05:12.650> that<00:05:12.680> do<00:05:13.280> let's<00:05:13.580> take<00:05:13.670> a<00:05:13.700> look

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
and what does that do let's take a look

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.730 
and what does that do let's take a look
at<00:05:14.000> that<00:05:14.150> real<00:05:14.330> quick<00:05:16.240> traits<00:05:17.240> here<00:05:17.740> power

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
at that real quick traits here power

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.890 
at that real quick traits here power
space<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:21.760> protect<00:05:22.760> yourself<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.270> seven<00:05:23.660> okay

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
space and protect yourself a seven okay

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.220 
space and protect yourself a seven okay
cool

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
cool

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.320 
cool
that's<00:05:24.410> just<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.620> barrier<00:05:25.130> around<00:05:25.280> all<00:05:25.970> your

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
that's just a barrier around all your

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.970 
that's just a barrier around all your
team<00:05:27.230> ever<00:05:27.440> saw

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
team ever saw

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.760 
team ever saw
I<00:05:28.010> guess<00:05:29.000> it's<00:05:29.180> good<00:05:29.360> if<00:05:29.600> you're<00:05:29.810> in<00:05:29.900> a<00:05:30.020> raid<00:05:30.410> or

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
I guess it's good if you're in a raid or

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.590 
I guess it's good if you're in a raid or
in<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.400> alert<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:33.820> okay<00:05:34.820> this<00:05:35.060> one<00:05:35.270> this<00:05:35.420> one

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
in a alert so okay this one this one

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.860 
in a alert so okay this one this one
probably<00:05:36.020> one<00:05:36.140> of<00:05:36.200> my<00:05:36.290> favorite<00:05:36.590> ones<00:05:37.870> that's

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
probably one of my favorite ones that's

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.920 
probably one of my favorite ones that's
that<00:05:39.200> was<00:05:39.380> cool<00:05:39.650> because<00:05:40.000> what<00:05:41.000> happens<00:05:41.390> is<00:05:41.600> if

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
that was cool because what happens is if

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.760 
that was cool because what happens is if
it<00:05:42.230> pulls<00:05:42.590> them<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:44.030> pulls<00:05:44.330> them<00:05:44.500> enemies<00:05:45.500> in

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
it pulls them it pulls them enemies in

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.400 
it pulls them it pulls them enemies in
and<00:05:46.010> then<00:05:46.370> you<00:05:47.240> know<00:05:47.390> at<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.780> end<00:05:47.810> it'll<00:05:48.140> blow

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
and then you know at the end it'll blow

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.410 
and then you know at the end it'll blow
up<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:48.950> do<00:05:49.370> it<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.550> little<00:05:49.640> bit<00:05:49.820> more<00:05:50.030> damage<00:05:50.390> so

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
up and do it a little bit more damage so

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.980 
up and do it a little bit more damage so
that's<00:05:50.750> pretty<00:05:50.990> cool<00:05:51.200> I<00:05:51.320> like<00:05:51.350> that

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
that's pretty cool I like that
