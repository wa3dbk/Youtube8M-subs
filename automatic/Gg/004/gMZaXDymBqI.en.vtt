00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
sift it right through there all right go

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.859 
sift it right through there all right go
through<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.560> salt<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:02.920> there

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.000 

we're<00:02:08.869> going<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.050> get<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.259> mixed<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:12.010> now

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
we're going to get that mixed in now

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.250 
we're going to get that mixed in now
with<00:02:13.220> any<00:02:13.430> uh<00:02:13.520> any<00:02:14.450> batter<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.200> to

in there put the eggs in there give us

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.640 
in there put the eggs in there give us
good<00:02:40.490> mix<00:02:40.730> could<00:02:41.660> be<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> little<00:02:41.990> runny<00:02:42.170> now<00:02:42.440> one

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
good mix could be a little runny now one

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.949 
good mix could be a little runny now one
of<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.800> other<00:02:42.830> things<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.220> learned<00:02:43.690> during<00:02:44.690> my

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
of the other things I learned during my

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.330 
of the other things I learned during my
homework<00:02:45.520> on<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:46.880> recipe<00:02:47.420> was<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:49.040> reason

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
homework on this recipe was the reason

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.800 
homework on this recipe was the reason
why<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.520> let<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:49.850> set<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
why you let this set is so that the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.930 
why you let this set is so that the
flour<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.760> call<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.240> strong<00:02:54.940> I'm

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
flour can they call it get strong I'm

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.130 
flour can they call it get strong I'm
not<00:02:56.060> sure<00:02:56.240> what<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.480> means<00:02:56.630> how<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.780> firm<00:02:57.110> up

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
not sure what that means how to firm up

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.070 
not sure what that means how to firm up
a<00:02:57.410> little<00:02:57.590> bit<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.570> beautiful<00:02:59.810> thing

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
a little bit now the beautiful thing

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.350 
a little bit now the beautiful thing
about<00:03:00.110> making<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.740> set<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.310> we're<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.300> to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
about making this set is we're going to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.940 
about making this set is we're going to
wait<00:03:02.510> about<00:03:02.630> 30<00:03:02.990> minutes<00:03:03.350> for<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.590> thing<00:03:03.770> to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
wait about 30 minutes for this thing to

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.070 
wait about 30 minutes for this thing to
firm<00:03:04.130> up<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.400> little<00:03:04.550> bit<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.840> will<00:03:05.930> give

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
firm up a little bit and that will give

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.150 
firm up a little bit and that will give
us<00:03:06.140> plenty<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.470> time<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.709> go<00:03:06.830> over<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.070> oven

and set it to 450 degrees and get it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.650 
and set it to 450 degrees and get it
preheated<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.640> let's<00:03:10.820> do<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.060> right<00:03:11.209> now

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
in a muffin tin a lot easier there we go

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.289 
in a muffin tin a lot easier there we go
now<00:03:36.980> when<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.220> bakes<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:37.940> all<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.239> time
