00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.730
 such friends again seba fernandez 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.119
 this time with a tutorial to learn to 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.930
 block cheats in mode 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.580
 online are the waste fats that 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.039
 the parties collapse when they go 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.160
 losing or when they are only 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.900
 willing to win or draw 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.450
 that is not banque to be bad 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.310
 and go losing the matches and start 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 to bring down the parties good in this 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.020
 opportunity 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.770
 konami production 2014 gives us the 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.500
 possibility of after seeing the message 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.990
 that warn us that the party will 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.990
 Suspend because of a connection problem 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.820
 appears on the screen 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.180
 which are watching this screen 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.420
 show us our username 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.820
 with our points indicating that the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.860
 our score does not suffer changes is not going to 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.399
 undergo changes in this regard because the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.310
 party declares null on the other side 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.649
 we have the user of the garbage 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.630
 with the message that says there will be no changes 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.479
 of valuation because the party is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 Nor he declared null keep the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.149
 match results this always 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 appears every time on the other side a 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.780
 of these garbage that still continue with 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.080
 lifetime 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.770
 the party collapses but in this 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.420
 opportunity 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.619
 konami provides us with a solution 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.180
 that allows us to block the user in 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.690
 this screen you can see there 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.980
 down that squeezing the triangle 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.110
 allows us to add the rival user to 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.010
 a block list is ready to 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.470
 blocking what is not 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.990
 this block list works from the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.660
 following way when creating or 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.550
 return to play both league games 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.330
 master as online matches 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.670
 this block list will not allow 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.880
 and select a user that we 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.210
 we have blocked so 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.930
 this garbage in this case reigns toa fcr n 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:36.420
 with me he will not be able to play again 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 I repeat, I do not think it's a solution 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.320
 chord 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.020
 to this problem the solution should be 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.630
 root 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.450
 but it is the solution that we have today 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 this way I personally do not go to 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.100
 return to undertake this user but 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.190
 this user will be able to continue doing 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.240
 trap crumbling parties and declaring 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 matches that are losing as null 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.610
 good friends this has been all for this 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.770
 video I hope you liked it and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.910
 served hopefully at some point we can 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.800
 be in front of the solution of this 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.080
 problem we do not have to walk 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.780
 blocking users but the same 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.210
 online system detect what is the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.000
 connection that goes down what is the solution 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.810
 who is trying to declare nule a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.480
 match and give the points to the other 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.870
 rival who is willing to win lose 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.870
 or tie 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.010

 they can also give a like to the video 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.150
