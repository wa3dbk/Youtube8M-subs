00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499 
are talking about number sequences

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.740 
are talking about number sequences
pretty<00:00:15.499> exciting<00:00:16.039> last<00:00:16.580> month<00:00:16.910> we<00:00:17.270> talked

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
about the number sequence 1 1 1 so this

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.600 
about the number sequence 1 1 1 so this
month<00:00:20.780> we<00:00:21.050> are<00:00:21.080> going<00:00:21.350> to<00:00:21.620> talk<00:00:21.860> about<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
number sequence 2 2 2 so when you see

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.630 
number sequence 2 2 2 so when you see
number<00:00:25.940> sequences<00:00:26.540> they<00:00:26.780> are<00:00:27.020> always

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
number sequences they are always

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.250 
number sequences they are always
signifying<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:28.940> bigger<00:00:29.540> omen<00:00:30.020> a<00:00:30.080> bigger

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
so when you see specifically the number

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.450 
so when you see specifically the number
2<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:35.090> 2<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:36.109> is<00:00:36.379> an<00:00:36.499> omen<00:00:36.949> that<00:00:37.309> your

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.930 
life's mission this particular number
sequence<00:00:44.210> has<00:00:44.449> 2<00:00:45.109> 2<00:00:45.679> meanings<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:46.370> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
sequence has 2 2 meanings to it the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.479 
sequence has 2 2 meanings to it the
first<00:00:47.210> general<00:00:47.929> meaning<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.499> that<00:00:48.980> there's<00:00:49.399> a

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
shift in the grid the consciousness the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.220 
shift in the grid the consciousness the
collective<00:00:52.730> consciousness<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.510> there's

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
collective consciousness and there's

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.340 
collective consciousness and there's

number that your thoughts are in

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.770 
number that your thoughts are in
particularly<00:01:51.160> high<00:01:51.550> alignment<00:01:52.509> with<00:01:52.750> that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
particularly high alignment with that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.410 
particularly high alignment with that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.139 
message and with that universal truth so
it's<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.780> very<00:01:56.050> very<00:01:56.920> strong<00:01:57.369> place<00:01:57.670> for<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.000> to

there's<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.000> some<00:03:07.840> shifts<00:03:08.230> that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
there's going to be some shifts that

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.950 
there's going to be some shifts that
occur<00:03:08.410> there<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.250> shifts<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.420> way<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.810> we

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
occur there so shifts in the way that we

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.380 
occur there so shifts in the way that we
think<00:03:11.290> about<00:03:11.560> things<00:03:12.180> shifts<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.360> way

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
think about things shifts in the way

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.360 
think about things shifts in the way
that<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.750> perceive<00:03:13.960> things<00:03:14.680> which<00:03:15.040> again

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that we perceive things which again

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.810 
that we perceive things which again
comes<00:03:15.610> back<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.060> our<00:03:16.090> thought<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:17.610> shifts<00:03:18.610> in

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
comes back to our thought and shifts in

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.960 
comes back to our thought and shifts in
the<00:03:19.780> communities<00:03:20.680> around<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.580> we<00:03:21.700> surround

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
the communities around that we surround

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.830 
the communities around that we surround
ourselves<00:03:22.120> with<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:24.720> something<00:03:25.720> that

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
ourselves with so it's something that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.360 
ourselves with so it's something that
I've<00:03:25.960> always<00:03:26.110> practiced<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:27.100> I'm<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
I've always practiced like I'm a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.430 
I've always practiced like I'm a
byproduct<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.390> five<00:03:28.600> people<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.080> spend<00:03:29.350> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
byproduct of the five people I spend the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.640 
byproduct of the five people I spend the
most<00:03:29.590> time<00:03:29.740> with<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.840> made<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> conscious

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
most time with so I made a conscious

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.100 
most time with so I made a conscious
choice<00:03:32.680> many<00:03:33.520> years<00:03:33.760> ago<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.570> surround<00:03:34.930> myself

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
choice many years ago to surround myself

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.990 
choice many years ago to surround myself
with<00:03:35.440> really<00:03:35.890> positive<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.790> high

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
with really positive and high

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.540 
with really positive and high
vibrational<00:03:37.630> people<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:38.380> as<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.890> result<00:03:39.340> my

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
vibrational people and as a result my

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.740 
vibrational people and as a result my
entire<00:03:40.000> world<00:03:40.450> shifted<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:42.480> get<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.600> do

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
entire world shifted and I get to do

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.190 
entire world shifted and I get to do
what<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.960> love<00:03:44.170> every<00:03:44.800> day<00:03:44.980> now<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:46.240> it's<00:03:46.660> such

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
what I love every day now and it's such

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.740 
what I love every day now and it's such
a<00:03:47.230> gift<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.760> that's<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.090> really<00:03:49.360> good<00:03:49.510> place

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.490 
a gift and so that's a really good place
to<00:03:50.020> start

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
to start

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.740
