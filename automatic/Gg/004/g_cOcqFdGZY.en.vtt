flowers line coming up flowers is a
novelty<00:00:27.449> yarn<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.320> these<00:00:29.099> yarns<00:00:29.640> tend<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.359> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
novelty yarn and these yarns tend to be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.540 
novelty yarn and these yarns tend to be
used<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.800> accents<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:33.630> other<00:00:34.200> pieces<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:35.070> have

used as accents for other pieces or have

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.030 
used as accents for other pieces or have
kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> interesting<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:37.200> fun<00:00:37.469> details

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
kind of interesting little fun details

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.020 
kind of interesting little fun details
on<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.390> these<00:00:39.660> little<00:00:40.440> loopy<00:00:41.040> flowers

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
on them like these little loopy flowers

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.380 
on them like these little loopy flowers
and<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:43.280> comes<00:00:44.280> from<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:45.770> boucle<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.090> yarn

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and this comes from a boucle in the yarn

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.040 
and this comes from a boucle in the yarn
so<00:00:49.379> let<00:00:49.590> me<00:00:49.649> show<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.910> individual<00:00:51.600> strand

so let me show you the individual strand

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.209 
so let me show you the individual strand
that<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.649> end<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:53.010> creating<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:55.230> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that we end up creating this from it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.660 
that we end up creating this from it's
got<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:58.280> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.690> wine<00:01:00.690> D

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
got all of these little kind of wine D

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
got all of these little kind of wine D
twine<00:01:02.670> things<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.870> little

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
twine things that have these little

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.730 
twine things that have these little
loops<00:01:04.670> here<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.909> different<00:01:06.420> intervals<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
loops here at different intervals in the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
loops here at different intervals in the
yarn<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.880> lets<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.479> really

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
yarn and this lets you do some really

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.370 
yarn and this lets you do some really
cool<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.040> interesting<00:01:11.159> things<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
cool and interesting things that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
cool and interesting things that
normally<00:01:13.380> yarns<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.570> going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
normally yarns don't so I'm just going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070 
normally yarns don't so I'm just going
to<00:01:15.750> show<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> work<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.909> yarn<00:01:18.360> like

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to show you how to work with a yarn like

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
to show you how to work with a yarn like
this<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.860> when<00:01:20.159> casting<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.150> recommend

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this now when casting on I recommend

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.580 
this now when casting on I recommend
that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.180> backwards<00:01:24.960> loop<00:01:25.110> cast<00:01:25.170> on

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that you use the backwards loop cast on

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
that you use the backwards loop cast on
or<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.950> simple<00:01:26.310> cast<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:26.939> people<00:01:27.180> call

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
or the simple cast on some people call

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.569 
or the simple cast on some people call
it<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> hold<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> yarn<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it we're just going to hold the yarn in

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.170 
it we're just going to hold the yarn in
our<00:01:30.090> hand<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.799> wrap<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> around

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
our hand like so and then wrap it around

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
our hand like so and then wrap it around
the<00:01:33.869> needle<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.409> want<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.829> very

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the needle now you want to be very

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
the needle now you want to be very
careful<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:38.900> loops

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
careful when you have these little loops

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.370 
careful when you have these little loops
here<00:01:40.670> because<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> way<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
here because they can get in the way and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.600 
here because they can get in the way and
make<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.799> bit<00:01:43.979> difficult<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
make it a little bit difficult for you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.539 
make it a little bit difficult for you
to<00:01:44.729> find<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.149> stitches<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.250> aware

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to find your stitches so just be aware

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.929 
to find your stitches so just be aware
of<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.450> casting<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> I'm

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
of that as you are casting on so I'm

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.670 
of that as you are casting on so I'm
just<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> cast<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> few<00:01:55.229> stitches

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
just going to cast on a few stitches

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
just going to cast on a few stitches
here<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.829> kind<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
here and we can see that this is kind of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450 
here and we can see that this is kind of
a<00:02:00.170> single<00:02:01.170> ply<00:02:01.350> yarn<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.979> has<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.430> been

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
a single ply yarn that has then been

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.490 
a single ply yarn that has then been
inter<00:02:03.740> twined<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:06.090> black<00:02:06.899> thread<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
inter twined with some black thread and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.650 
inter twined with some black thread and
the<00:02:10.500> way<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.190> been<00:02:11.430> intertwined<00:02:12.180> with

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the way that it's been intertwined with

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.850 
the way that it's been intertwined with
the<00:02:12.989> yarn<00:02:13.260> has

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the yarn has

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
the yarn has
gives<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.220> sort<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.580> an<00:02:14.730> interesting<00:02:15.620> shape

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
gives it sort of an interesting shape

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.130 
gives it sort of an interesting shape
and<00:02:16.980> texture<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.730> that's<00:02:18.330> gonna<00:02:18.450> give<00:02:19.110> us

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and texture and that's gonna give us

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.400 
and texture and that's gonna give us
some<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.560> cool<00:02:20.060> effects<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.570> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
some really cool effects in the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.090 
some really cool effects in the
stockinette<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.390> our<00:02:24.390> yarn<00:02:24.830> that's<00:02:25.830> another

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
stockinette of our yarn that's another

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.270 
stockinette of our yarn that's another
thing<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:27.060> should<00:02:27.360> mention<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.280> you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
thing that we should mention is that you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.760 
thing that we should mention is that you
probably<00:02:29.880> aren't<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.810> want<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.440> knit

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
probably aren't going to want to knit

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.470

any type of pattern into this yarn

any type of pattern into this yarn

because you will sort of lose most of
the<00:02:39.840> effect<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:41.160> not<00:02:41.340> impossible<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:43.080> knit<00:02:43.290> a

the effect it's not impossible to knit a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.750 
the effect it's not impossible to knit a
pattern<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.420> yarn<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.950> not

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
pattern with this yarn but it's not

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.440 
pattern with this yarn but it's not
going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> let<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.390> yarn<00:02:49.130> highlight<00:02:50.450> its

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
going to let the yarn highlight its

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.380 
going to let the yarn highlight its
features<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.880> gonna<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.180> very

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
features and it's gonna be very

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.220 
features and it's gonna be very
difficult<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:55.080> recognize<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:56.520> pattern<00:02:57.230> so

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
difficult to recognize the pattern so

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.840 
difficult to recognize the pattern so
now<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.470> I've<00:02:58.620> got<00:02:58.770> all<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.489> stitches

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
now that I've got all of the stitches

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.440 
now that I've got all of the stitches
that<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.060> want<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:00.780> practice<00:03:01.910> swatch<00:03:02.910> here

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
that I want for my practice swatch here

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.150 
that I want for my practice swatch here
I'm<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.320> gonna<00:03:04.440> start<00:03:04.860> knitting<00:03:05.300> into<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
I'm just gonna start knitting into the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.949 
I'm just gonna start knitting into the
stitches<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.370> want<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.580> be<00:03:08.640> careful<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
stitches and you want to be careful that

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.010 
stitches and you want to be careful that
you're<00:03:10.110> picking<00:03:10.350> up<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.000> whole<00:03:12.000> stitch<00:03:12.450> that

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
you're picking up the whole stitch that

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.530 
you're picking up the whole stitch that
you're<00:03:13.200> getting<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.980> yarn<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:14.489> once

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.289 

as<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.140> I'm<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.010> knit<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
as you go and I'm just going to knit the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.270 
as you go and I'm just going to knit the
standard<00:03:24.750> stockinette<00:03:25.320> stitch<00:03:25.440> now<00:03:25.799> here

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
standard stockinette stitch now here

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520 
standard stockinette stitch now here
where<00:03:26.820> I've<00:03:27.000> got<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> bunch<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> loops<00:03:28.110> I

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
where I've got a bunch of the loops I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.110 
where I've got a bunch of the loops I
want<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.130> make<00:03:29.220> sure<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.549> I'm<00:03:29.670> getting<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
want to make sure that I'm getting the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.650 
want to make sure that I'm getting the
stitch<00:03:30.570> properly<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.470> need<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.799> get<00:03:31.920> under

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
stitch properly so I need to get under

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.759 
stitch properly so I need to get under
the<00:03:33.660> stitch<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> don't<00:03:34.440> want<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> get

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
the stitch and I don't want to get

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.340 
the stitch and I don't want to get
through<00:03:35.190> any<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.610> those<00:03:35.880> loops<00:03:39.049> because<00:03:40.049> that

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
through any of those loops because that

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.810 
through any of those loops because that
would<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> big<00:03:40.860> mess<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.220> think<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.549> lot<00:03:44.790> of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
would be a big mess and I think a lot of

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.300 
would be a big mess and I think a lot of
people<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:45.239> intimidated<00:03:45.570> by<00:03:46.049> using<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:47.070> yarn

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
people are intimidated by using a yarn

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.860 
people are intimidated by using a yarn
like<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.970> because<00:03:48.269> they<00:03:48.420> don't<00:03:48.510> know<00:03:48.690> what

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
like this because they don't know what

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.199 
like this because they don't know what
to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.350> with<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.070> they're<00:03:50.790> not<00:03:50.820> quite<00:03:51.180> sure

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
to do with it and they're not quite sure

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.630 
to do with it and they're not quite sure
how<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.840> knit<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> most<00:03:56.519> part

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
how to knit it but for the most part

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.850 
how to knit it but for the most part
it's<00:03:57.090> pretty<00:03:57.209> standard<00:03:57.780> we're<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.470> going<00:03:58.799> to

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
it's pretty standard we're just going to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.090 
it's pretty standard we're just going to
do<00:03:59.160> regular<00:03:59.910> stockinette<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.769> just<00:04:01.920> have

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
do regular stockinette and you just have

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.960 
do regular stockinette and you just have
to<00:04:02.220> be<00:04:02.370> careful<00:04:02.940> not<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.480> split<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.290> yarn<00:04:04.530> in

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
to be careful not to split the yarn in

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.270 
to be careful not to split the yarn in
any<00:04:05.970> way<00:04:06.180> or<00:04:06.420> get<00:04:06.570> your<00:04:06.930> needle<00:04:07.500> trapped<00:04:07.980> in

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
any way or get your needle trapped in

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.020 
any way or get your needle trapped in
between<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:10.079> thread<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.280> single<00:04:11.760> plied

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
between that thread and the single plied

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.780 
between that thread and the single plied
yarn<00:04:13.250> that's<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.579> there

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.270 

and<00:04:17.960> then<00:04:18.960> the<00:04:19.140> biggest<00:04:19.560> challenge<00:04:20.100> will<00:04:20.250> be

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and then the biggest challenge will be

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:28.900 
and then the biggest challenge will be
knitting<00:04:21.090> through<00:04:21.890> those<00:04:22.890> loopy<00:04:23.430> sections

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.340 

but<00:04:29.910> you'll<00:04:30.030> see<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.390> used<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.870> lot<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.110> times

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
but you'll see this used a lot of times

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.290 
but you'll see this used a lot of times
in<00:04:32.030> bags<00:04:33.030> or<00:04:33.600> scarfs<00:04:34.320> or<00:04:34.620> even<00:04:34.890> hats<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.640> you

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
in bags or scarfs or even hats and you

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.650 
in bags or scarfs or even hats and you
can<00:04:36.450> do<00:04:36.630> pretty<00:04:36.930> much<00:04:37.050> anything<00:04:38.630> like<00:04:39.630> that

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
can do pretty much anything like that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.650 
can do pretty much anything like that
with<00:04:40.200> this<00:04:40.410> type<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:41.040> yarn<00:04:41.370> now<00:04:42.060> here<00:04:42.450> I'm

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
with this type of yarn now here I'm

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.020 
with this type of yarn now here I'm
coming<00:04:42.840> up<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.230> another<00:04:43.530> one<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.340> these<00:04:44.580> loopy

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
coming up on another one of these loopy

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.180 
coming up on another one of these loopy
sections<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.560> can<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.800> little<00:04:46.980> bit

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
sections and that can be a little bit

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.770 
sections and that can be a little bit
difficult<00:04:47.340> coming<00:04:47.820> through<00:04:48.120> your<00:04:48.270> fingers<00:04:48.660> as

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
difficult coming through your fingers as

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.560 
difficult coming through your fingers as
well<00:04:48.960> so<00:04:49.170> just<00:04:49.500> want<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.920> be<00:04:50.190> aware<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:51.330> how<00:04:51.510> you

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
well so just want to be aware of how you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.930 
well so just want to be aware of how you
manage<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.170> yarn<00:04:52.650> we<00:04:53.430> want<00:04:53.670> to<00:04:53.790> make<00:04:53.910> sure

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
manage the yarn we want to make sure

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.050 
manage the yarn we want to make sure
that<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.390> entire<00:04:55.130> section<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.400> loops<00:04:56.730> gets

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that the entire section of loops gets

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.810 
that the entire section of loops gets
through<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:58.560> stitch<00:04:58.980> that<00:04:59.010> we<00:04:59.400> are<00:04:59.550> working

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
through the stitch that we are working

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.710
