trying<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> google<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.759> unable<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
trying to get that google I'm unable to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.569 
trying to get that google I'm unable to
do<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.189> he's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
do so but you see just you know he's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
do so but you see just you know he's
really<00:01:35.850> fast<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> your

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
really fast you can use that to your

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
really fast you can use that to your
advantage<00:01:37.320> trying<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.280> create<00:01:39.119> some<00:01:39.329> space

advantage trying to create some space
firm<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.380> those<00:01:40.560> wristers<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.189> or

firm and then get those wristers off or

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
firm and then get those wristers off or
slap<00:01:41.790> shots<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> opportunity

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and don't even worry about you can back

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
and don't even worry about you can back
check<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.270> he's<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.170> quick<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.829> catch

check to he's so quick that he can catch

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
check to he's so quick that he can catch
up<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> plays<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.630> it

we're running a little

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.320 
we're running a little
the<00:02:01.290> energy<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.220> what<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> want<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.119> on

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
the the play is gonna be called dead in

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.070 
the the play is gonna be called dead in
one<00:02:17.640> second<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.239> then<00:02:18.420> we're<00:02:18.540> gonna<00:02:18.630> go<00:02:18.900> off

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
one second and then we're gonna go off

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.140 
one second and then we're gonna go off
and<00:02:19.350> take<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> break<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.069> kind<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.850> rest<00:02:21.030> of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
and take a break I kind of the rest of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.610 
and take a break I kind of the rest of
the<00:02:21.209> gameplay<00:02:21.660> essentially<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:22.470> there

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the gameplay essentially because there

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.199 
the gameplay essentially because there
wasn't<00:02:22.770> any<00:02:22.980> need<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.310> show<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.910> we're

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
wasn't any need to show it and we're

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.820 
wasn't any need to show it and we're

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
gonna cut right ahead here to last 30

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.559 
gonna cut right ahead here to last 30
seconds<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> game<00:02:26.489> we're<00:02:27.269> now<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
seconds of the game we're now on the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.990 
seconds of the game we're now on the
bench<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:28.110> here<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.769> we're<00:02:29.280> gonna<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.880> out

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
bench right here and we're gonna get out

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.759 
bench right here and we're gonna get out
into<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> play<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.840> we're<00:02:30.959> gonna<00:02:31.050> make<00:02:31.590> our

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
into the play and we're gonna make our

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.040 
into the play and we're gonna make our
opportunity<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.940> get<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.209> second<00:02:33.630> goal<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
opportunity to get that second goal and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.920 
opportunity to get that second goal and
to<00:02:34.319> complete<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.800> challenge<00:02:34.860> now<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to complete this challenge now this is a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.530 
to complete this challenge now this is a
easier<00:02:37.620> said<00:02:37.920> than<00:02:38.040> done<00:02:38.100> because

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
easier said than done because

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
easier said than done because
essentially<00:02:39.540> yes<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.200> score<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.769> an<00:02:40.920> empty

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
essentially yes you score on an empty

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.820 
essentially yes you score on an empty
net<00:02:41.340> that's<00:02:41.489> pretty<00:02:41.790> easy<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:42.840> most<00:02:43.230> often

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
net that's pretty easy but most often

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.590 
net that's pretty easy but most often
not<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.580> team<00:02:44.910> isn't<00:02:45.090> pull<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> goalie

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
not the team isn't pull the goalie

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.660 
not the team isn't pull the goalie
tillers<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.230> 30<00:02:46.470> seconds<00:02:46.980> left<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.400> here<00:02:47.640> we

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
tillers like 30 seconds left so here we

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.229 
tillers like 30 seconds left so here we
were<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> face<00:02:48.269> off<00:02:48.510> 14<00:02:48.810> seconds<00:02:49.470> left<00:02:49.680> and

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
were on the face off 14 seconds left and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.759 
were on the face off 14 seconds left and
very<00:02:51.239> close<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.170> happening<00:02:52.620> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
very close to this not happening and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.140 
very close to this not happening and
