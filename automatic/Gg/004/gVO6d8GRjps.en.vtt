range don't get hit anymore and then we

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.139 
range don't get hit anymore and then we
use<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.729> skill<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> area<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> effect<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
use my skill and the area of effect and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.980 
use my skill and the area of effect and
actually<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.210> don't<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.689> skill

dragging them towards the target so its

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.350 
dragging them towards the target so its
target<00:02:26.260> unit<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.310> shows<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.640> radius<00:02:28.209> that
