one<00:01:03.890> piece<00:01:04.189> I<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.970> like<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.689> have<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:05.900> long

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
one piece I just like to have a long

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.870 
one piece I just like to have a long
entrance<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.719> this<00:01:08.719> is<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.170> room<00:01:10.009> where<00:01:10.670> my

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
entrance and this is the room where my

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.989 
entrance and this is the room where my
hamsters<00:01:11.329> would<00:01:11.840> live<00:01:12.109> so<00:01:13.929> clay<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:16.039> clay<00:01:16.070> is

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
hamsters would live so clay the clay is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.330 
hamsters would live so clay the clay is
very<00:01:17.740> sensible<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:20.799> it's<00:01:21.799> like<00:01:22.039> like

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
very sensible it's it's like like

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.800 
very sensible it's it's like like
chocolate<00:01:22.819> later<00:01:23.179> when<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:23.899> hard<00:01:24.429> so<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.819> can

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
chocolate later when it's hard so it can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.899 
chocolate later when it's hard so it can
be<00:01:26.990> broken<00:01:27.710> very<00:01:28.130> easy<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.990> must<00:01:30.259> have<00:01:30.909> it

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
be broken very easy so it must have it

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.029 
be broken very easy so it must have it
must<00:01:31.939> be<00:01:32.329> thick<00:01:32.569> thick<00:01:33.020> enough<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:36.039> it

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
must be thick thick enough so it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.749 
must be thick thick enough so it
wouldn't<00:01:37.729> break<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.560> easy<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.600> therefore

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
wouldn't break so so easy and therefore

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.379 
wouldn't break so so easy and therefore
this<00:01:43.759> year<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.299> approximately<00:01:45.009> 2<00:01:46.329> yeah<00:01:47.329> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
need 5 centimeter for entrance this is
exactly<00:02:06.079> 5<00:02:06.319> centimeters<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:07.369> so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.030 

damn<00:02:12.370> okay<00:02:13.060> let's<00:02:13.269> start<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.560> are

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
damn okay let's start so you are

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.670 
damn okay let's start so you are
modeling<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:20.439> entrance<00:02:20.950> first<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.469> should

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
modeling the entrance first so it should

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.830 
modeling the entrance first so it should
have<00:02:23.859> should<00:02:24.579> be<00:02:24.870> after<00:02:25.870> after<00:02:26.829> modeling

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
have should be after after modeling

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
have should be after after modeling
approximately<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.049> centimeter<00:02:29.409> high<00:02:30.010> or<00:02:30.310> one

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
approximately one centimeter high or one

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:42.089 
approximately one centimeter high or one
inch<00:02:31.599> shy<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.970> that's<00:02:38.250> okay<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.769> the

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
inch shy so that's okay and this is the

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.089 
inch shy so that's okay and this is the
entrance<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.689> is<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> living<00:02:44.049> room<00:02:44.290> so

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
entrance and this is the living room so

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.960 
entrance and this is the living room so
we<00:02:45.670> are<00:02:45.879> put<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.859> clade<00:02:48.220> more<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.209> middle

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
we are put the clade more to the middle

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.229 
we are put the clade more to the middle
so<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:52.419> the<00:02:52.739> sides<00:02:53.739> here<00:02:54.069> it's<00:02:54.579> approximately

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
so on the sides here it's approximately

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:03.409 
so on the sides here it's approximately
one<00:02:55.900> centimeter<00:02:56.230> high<00:02:56.799> or<00:02:57.609> one<00:02:58.060> inch<00:02:59.549> and<00:03:01.919> so

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
one centimeter high or one inch and so

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:10.800 
one centimeter high or one inch and so
it's<00:03:07.109> middle<00:03:08.109> it's<00:03:08.530> getting<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:10.239> size<00:03:10.540> is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
it's middle it's getting the size is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:25.229 
it's middle it's getting the size is
increasing<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:24.190> with<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.669> fingers

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
increasing so so with the fingers

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:36.119 
increasing so so with the fingers
I<00:03:25.269> am<00:03:25.930> forming<00:03:26.349> now<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.780> dome<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:34.709> take<00:03:35.709> care

this later
and<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.750> minutes<00:06:14.380> when<00:06:15.380> when<00:06:15.979> when<00:06:16.940> it's

and that minutes when when when it's

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.170 
and that minutes when when when it's
when<00:06:17.389> it's<00:06:17.419> curved<00:06:17.900> so<00:06:18.080> you<00:06:18.199> can<00:06:18.520> set<00:06:19.520> and<00:06:19.699> find

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
when it's curved so you can set and find

when it's curved so you can set and find
out<00:06:20.449> how<00:06:20.750> to<00:06:21.610> put<00:06:22.610> this<00:06:22.760> on<00:06:23.150> again<00:06:23.630> later

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
out how to put this on again later

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.330 
out how to put this on again later
and<00:06:26.480> yes<00:06:27.480> I<00:06:27.870> think<00:06:29.330> that's<00:06:30.330> all<00:06:31.100> no<00:06:32.100> you<00:06:32.160> have

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
and yes I think that's all no you have

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.660 
and yes I think that's all no you have
to<00:06:32.550> wait<00:06:32.730> for<00:06:33.350> approximately<00:06:34.350> three<00:06:35.100> days<00:06:35.130> or

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
to wait for approximately three days or

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.690 
to wait for approximately three days or
so<00:06:35.910> then<00:06:36.540> it's<00:06:36.720> hard<00:06:36.960> and<00:06:37.920> then<00:06:38.130> you<00:06:38.280> can<00:06:38.460> put

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
so then it's hard and then you can put

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.690 
so then it's hard and then you can put
this<00:06:38.850> into<00:06:39.150> your<00:06:39.830> hamster<00:06:40.830> cage<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:43.700> my

is<00:07:41.340> I<00:07:41.990> the<00:07:42.990> exit<00:07:43.350> is<00:07:43.500> in<00:07:43.850> one<00:07:44.850> corner<00:07:45.180> of<00:07:45.510> your

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:45.690 
is I the exit is in one corner of your

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.690 
is I the exit is in one corner of your
cages

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700 
cages

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.240 
cages
it's<00:07:47.700> not<00:07:48.240> going<00:07:48.720> to<00:07:48.900> the<00:07:49.050> middle<00:07:49.410> of<00:07:49.530> the<00:07:49.979> cage

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.250 
it's not going to the middle of the cage

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.050 
it's not going to the middle of the cage
I<00:07:50.970> think<00:07:51.660> this<00:07:51.840> is<00:07:52.050> the<00:07:53.010> best<00:07:53.190> position<00:07:53.520> for

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 
I think this is the best position for

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:00.440 
I think this is the best position for
you<00:07:56.510> okay<00:07:57.510> bye
