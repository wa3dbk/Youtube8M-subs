little<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.090> different<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.829> in<00:01:49.829> every<00:01:50.280> router

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
little bit different in in every router

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.690 
little bit different in in every router
but<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.450> you'll<00:01:51.600> look<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.200> I've<00:01:52.680> got<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.950> set

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
but if you'll look here I've got it set

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.139 
but if you'll look here I've got it set
up<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.770> traffic<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.790> comes

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
up so that all of my traffic that comes

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.319 
up so that all of my traffic that comes
to<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.530> computer<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.119> running

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
to my computer it's going to be running

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.330 
to my computer it's going to be running
through<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> open<00:02:01.110> DNS<00:02:01.530> servers<00:02:01.979> which<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
through the open DNS servers which you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
through the open DNS servers which you
can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.600> 208<00:02:04.009> 67<00:02:05.009> 222<00:02:05.759> 222<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.960> then

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
can see here the 208 67 222 222 and then

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070 
can see here the 208 67 222 222 and then
the<00:02:07.680> secondary<00:02:08.129> dns<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.119> well<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the secondary dns here as well and I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.460 
the secondary dns here as well and I
receive<00:02:10.470> those<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> Open<00:02:11.310> DNS<00:02:11.459> site<00:02:11.940> so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
receive those from the Open DNS site so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.280 
receive those from the Open DNS site so
this<00:02:13.740> will<00:02:14.100> go<00:02:14.970> ahead<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.930> traffic

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
this will go ahead and have all traffic

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.620 
this will go ahead and have all traffic
filtered<00:02:16.920> through<00:02:17.340> those<00:02:17.910> routers<00:02:18.390> which

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
filtered through those routers which

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.350 
filtered through those routers which
will<00:02:18.840> filter<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> content<00:02:20.060> now<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.330> a

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
will filter the content now there is a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.170 
will filter the content now there is a
way<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:22.320> users<00:02:22.820> if<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:23.880> have

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
way for users if they have

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720 
way for users if they have
administrative<00:02:24.870> rights<00:02:24.960> on<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:25.440> network<00:02:25.980> to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
get into the networking properties and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.900 
get into the networking properties and
to<00:02:29.070> bypass<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:30.570> open<00:02:30.990> DNS<00:02:31.440> server<00:02:32.430> settings

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
to bypass the open DNS server settings

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.930 
to bypass the open DNS server settings
that<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.300> set<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.750> your<00:02:34.080> router<00:02:34.550> way<00:02:35.550> around

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
that you set on your router way around

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.180 
that you set on your router way around
this<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.570> force<00:02:36.870> all<00:02:37.140> users<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.980> within

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
this you can force all users so within

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.790 
this you can force all users so within
your<00:02:38.340> network<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.600> do<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.470> I'm<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.770> to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
your network to do that and I'm going to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.340 
your network to do that and I'm going to
show<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.010> how<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> do<00:02:42.210> that<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.230> you'll

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
show you how to do that so if you'll

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.900 
show you how to do that so if you'll
come<00:02:43.530> over<00:02:43.560> here<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.040> again<00:02:44.250> every<00:02:44.490> router<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
come over here and again every router is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.500 
come over here and again every router is
different<00:02:46.520> within<00:02:47.520> some<00:02:47.820> routers<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.360> will

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
different within some routers it will

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
different within some routers it will
say<00:02:48.950> block<00:02:49.950> services<00:02:50.640> access<00:02:51.209> control<00:02:51.720> port

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
say block services access control port

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.220 
say block services access control port
filtering<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.280> goes<00:02:53.459> by<00:02:53.700> different<00:02:53.760> names<00:02:54.230> but

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
filtering it goes by different names but

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.400 
filtering it goes by different names but
on<00:02:55.650> mine<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.400> happens<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.030> block<00:02:57.690> services

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
on mine it happens to be block services

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.860 
on mine it happens to be block services
so<00:02:59.100> I'll<00:02:59.190> go<00:02:59.310> ahead<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.610> click<00:02:59.850> there<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.510> I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
so I'll go ahead and click there and I

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.650 
so I'll go ahead and click there and I
have<00:03:01.110> services<00:03:01.709> blocking<00:03:02.280> set<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.760> always<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
have services blocking set to always and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.440 
have services blocking set to always and
I<00:03:04.230> clicked<00:03:04.620> add<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> little<00:03:05.280> bit<00:03:05.400> earlier<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.030> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
I clicked add a little bit earlier and I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720 
I clicked add a little bit earlier and I
created<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.380> content<00:03:07.890> filter<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.610> what

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
created a content filter it's just what

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.170 
created a content filter it's just what
I<00:03:08.760> named<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.930> block<00:03:10.170> traffic<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.250> port<00:03:11.280> 83

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
I named it to block traffic on port 83

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
I named it to block traffic on port 83
which<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> port<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:12.930> they<00:03:13.170> would<00:03:13.320> use<00:03:13.650> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
which is a port that they would use to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.800 
which is a port that they would use to
circumvent<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:17.340> router<00:03:17.580> settings<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.690> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
circumvent the router settings that you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.650 
circumvent the router settings that you
put<00:03:19.050> on<00:03:19.170> connected<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> open<00:03:20.430> DNS<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.570> I'll

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
put on connected to open DNS so I'll

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.970 
put on connected to open DNS so I'll
show<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.140> looks<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.620> I'll<00:03:22.860> go

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
show you what that looks like I'll go

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.270 
show you what that looks like I'll go
ahead<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.370> edit<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.820> here<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.410> titled

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
ahead and edit it here so I just titled

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.720 
ahead and edit it here so I just titled
it<00:03:26.400> content<00:03:26.880> filter<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:28.140> TCP<00:03:28.739> UDP<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.550> what

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
it content filter the TCP UDP is what

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.550 
it content filter the TCP UDP is what
you<00:03:29.850> want<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.120> select<00:03:30.420> starting<00:03:30.989> port<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
you want to select starting port and

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.240 
you want to select starting port and
ending<00:03:32.310> port<00:03:32.580> or<00:03:32.790> 53<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.080> I'm<00:03:34.200> blocking<00:03:34.980> port

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
ending port or 53 so I'm blocking port

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.330 
ending port or 53 so I'm blocking port
53<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.630> chose<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.230> IP<00:03:37.470> addresses<00:03:37.680> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
53 and then I chose all IP addresses and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.370 
53 and then I chose all IP addresses and
clicked<00:03:38.580> accept<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.140> going<00:03:40.320> to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
clicked accept so what that's going to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.080 
clicked accept so what that's going to
do<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.830> it's<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.370> allow<00:03:41.610> people<00:03:41.850> that

it typed up a lot of this sounds like

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.420 
it typed up a lot of this sounds like
technological<00:04:21.599> a<00:04:21.840> Babel<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:23.070> I've<00:04:23.190> typed

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
technological a Babel and so I've typed

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.710 
technological a Babel and so I've typed
a<00:04:23.610> bunch<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.060> up<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.360> I'm<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> move

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
a bunch of that up and I'm going to move

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840 
a bunch of that up and I'm going to move
that<00:04:24.900> onto<00:04:25.320> your<00:04:25.440> screen<00:04:25.740> now

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
that onto your screen now

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.490 
that onto your screen now
and<00:04:27.530> move<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.740> about<00:04:29.130> here<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.210> way<00:04:31.170> you<00:04:31.200> can

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
and move it about here that way you can

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.860 
and move it about here that way you can
see<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.950> here<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.370> bulk<00:04:35.670> of<00:04:35.940> what<00:04:36.840> I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
see it here so this is a bulk of what I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.660 
see it here so this is a bulk of what I
just<00:04:37.050> talked<00:04:37.290> about<00:04:37.440> in<00:04:37.860> plain<00:04:38.190> English

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
just talked about in plain English

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.150 
just talked about in plain English
without<00:04:39.510> some<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.170> steps<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.710> course<00:04:40.890> that

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
without some of the steps of course that

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.050 
without some of the steps of course that
I<00:04:41.190> just<00:04:41.460> showed<00:04:41.670> you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
I just showed you

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.150 
I just showed you
so<00:04:42.660> my<00:04:42.870> recommendation<00:04:42.990> would<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.800> read

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
so my recommendation would be to read

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.880 
so my recommendation would be to read
over<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:45.240> better<00:04:45.420> understand<00:04:45.990> what<00:04:46.860> I

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
over this to better understand what I

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.740 
over this to better understand what I
was<00:04:47.100> speaking<00:04:47.430> about<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:48.000> more<00:04:48.240> importantly

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
was speaking about and more importantly

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.510 
was speaking about and more importantly
to<00:04:49.350> understand<00:04:49.830> how<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.040> can<00:04:50.190> go<00:04:50.340> into<00:04:50.460> your

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
to understand how you can go into your

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.180 
to understand how you can go into your
own<00:04:50.640> router<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.270> change<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:52.040> thanks<00:04:53.040> for

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
own router and change it thanks for

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.520 
own router and change it thanks for
watching
