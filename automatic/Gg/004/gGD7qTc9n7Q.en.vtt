00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:13.830
 fasten the nod hooks for this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.190
 achieve pva glue for those who want 1 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.220
 once and for all by us 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.080
 and you can attach the nod handle 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.119
 I use epoxy 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.950
 I prefer someone hq she is normal 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.539
 holding on 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.800
 if suddenly for some reason 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.860
 it will be necessary to unscrew the kellog then this 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.000
 will make the case easier with a purse 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.170
 most likely the foam just fall apart 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.850
 we will need another toothpick and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.969
 Passatizhik that technological 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.570
 the hole we made to cover 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:54.329
 pens with wood stain we screw the screw 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:59.440
 soldered nod but when twisting 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.989
 We try to make it so that even if 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.180
 otvetstvii gone a little bit towards us 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.290
 need to give the exact direction of kim to 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.320
 he stood in line with the handle sometimes i 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.080
 I do a little to the right a little to the left in order 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 to make it more convenient the game that is when we 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.020
 later we will hold the bait if 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.360
 line 1 and always convenient if nod 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.960
 goes a little here to the side in one or in 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.700
 second looking at what you where we keep 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.800
 if left-handed at the hour for that. done 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.340
 I will learn to twist your right hand 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.930
 the coil is sometimes more comfortable when the nod is 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.470
 slightly side but guess the direction 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 hard enough twist nod 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.410
 not until the end is not to shrink 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.650
 tubes leave a couple of millimeters 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:08.560
 so we cut the thread in the handle 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:15.030
 unscrew take glue pva and fill 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:22.210
 all god glue with a toothpick 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 we fill as much as possible our 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.310
 responsibly glue 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.330
 and now begin to twist it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.050
 carving from screws we already have that is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.950
 now you can not worry much but 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.050
 the most important thing for him to go and not to fall 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.910
 side so he was already on the chopped 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.850
 ride 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:11.240
 again without twisting to the end 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:14.850
 Check it worth returning even 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:20.990
 glue some pva with our 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.990
 screw and already finally screwed 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:35.300
 handle our screw extra glue clean 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.300
 the same toothpick 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.810
 and that's why we needed passatizhik and 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:55.340
 now we just plump once 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:04:01.370
 we twist it to the position we need 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.370
 there is trim rings 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.090
 fishing rod ready 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:26.150
 reel on the line 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.980
 thread through the rings snap small 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.139
 carabiner swivel which 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.919
 later our 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.919
 garland 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.820
 last subtlety left 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:53.079
 after soldering it is possible in soldering places 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:57.489
 little ringlets can be wrong of 

00:04:53.079 --> 00:05:01.259
 flexible to we need to check the wearing 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:04.899
 the gear we prepared initially 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:09.009
 put it behind the ring but i'm not sure what 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:11.259
 will be clearly visible if the line is not 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.860
 changed means go a little bit and that's it 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.369
 left in its place if in these 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.909
 places 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:21.969
 changed mouth corners needed very 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:25.319
 neatly fine sandpaper with this 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.619
 hand a little touch up and 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.119
 afterwards 

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:35.939
 more tint but if soldering is done 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:35.939
 correct then this is a private action
