00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
coin out of there as well boom we got it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
coin out of there as well boom we got it
alright<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.809> first<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.350> gonna<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
alright so first up we're gonna take a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.380 
alright so first up we're gonna take a
close-up<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> coin<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.820> actually<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
close-up on this coin here actually I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.720 
close-up on this coin here actually I
think<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.010> exact<00:00:59.370> point<00:00:59.609> from

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
think that we got this exact point from

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.340 
think that we got this exact point from
another<00:01:00.030> pack<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> while<00:01:00.570> ago<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
another pack a while ago this is just a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.529 
another pack a while ago this is just a
chespin<00:01:01.829> coin<00:01:02.039> last<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.120> fennekin

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
chespin coin last time we got fennekin

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
chespin coin last time we got fennekin
so<00:01:03.780> maybe<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> new<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.519> have

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so maybe this is new I know we have

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
so maybe this is new I know we have
chespin<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.180> before<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.630> i'm<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.840> sure<00:01:07.049> if

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
chespin from before but i'm not sure if

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
chespin from before but i'm not sure if
it<00:01:07.229> had<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.470> crazy<00:01:08.390> shower<00:01:09.390> pattern<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it had that crazy shower pattern to it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.530 
it had that crazy shower pattern to it
it's<00:01:10.680> also<00:01:10.770> take<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> look<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.820> fur<00:01:12.299> fro

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it's also take a look at the fur fro

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's also take a look at the fur fro
right<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.530> again<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> little

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
right here so again it's got a little

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.530 
right here so again it's got a little
bit<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> curve<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.180> bit<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
bit of a curve to it a little bit of a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.510 
bit of a curve to it a little bit of a
warping<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.320> oh<00:01:16.530> well<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> happens

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
warping but oh well that happens

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
warping but oh well that happens
sometimes<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.090> promo<00:01:18.360> cards<00:01:18.659> let's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
sometimes with these promo cards let's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
sometimes with these promo cards let's
zoom<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.340> pretty<00:01:21.180> cool-looking

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
zoom right in here pretty cool-looking

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.760 
zoom right in here pretty cool-looking
car<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> little<00:01:22.320> little

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
car it's got just a little little

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.770 
car it's got just a little little
holographic<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.400> some<00:01:23.520> sparkles<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.090> think

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
holographic with some sparkles I think

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.030 
holographic with some sparkles I think
that<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> holographic<00:01:25.500> pattern<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that the holographic pattern is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.170 
that the holographic pattern is
different<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> were<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
different on this then if you were to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940 
different on this then if you were to
get<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> actual<00:01:27.869> set<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
get this in the actual set so you can

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
get this in the actual set so you can
see<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> promo<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
see right there it's not a promo this is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.620 
see right there it's not a promo this is
actually<00:01:30.780> x<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> y<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.460> reprint<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> an

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
actually x and y so it's a reprint of an

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
actually x and y so it's a reprint of an
x<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.840> y<00:01:33.960> card<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.350> again<00:01:34.530> i<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
x and y card but again i think it has a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.800 
x and y card but again i think it has a
different<00:01:35.610> holographic<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> buy

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
different holographic so you have to buy

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.330 
different holographic so you have to buy
the<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> blister<00:01:38.159> pack

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the you have to get the blister pack

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
the you have to get the blister pack
you're<00:01:38.490> gonna<00:01:38.640> kill<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> variance<00:01:39.270> anyways

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you're gonna kill the variance anyways

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
you're gonna kill the variance anyways
let's<00:01:40.290> set<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> guy<00:01:40.979> inside<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.579> course<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
let's set that guy inside of course the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
let's set that guy inside of course the
main<00:01:42.150> attraction<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.750> usual<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.770> packs

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
main attraction as usual is the packs

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
main attraction as usual is the packs
right<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.600> last<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:45.990> had<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> grout

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
right here so last time we had to grout

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
right here so last time we had to grout
on<00:01:46.470> Kyogre<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> an<00:01:47.729> Agron<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.299> time<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.540> have

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on Kyogre and an Agron this time we have

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
on Kyogre and an Agron this time we have
gardevoir's<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.380> let's<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.649> ahead<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> open

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
gardevoir's so let's go ahead and open

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
gardevoir's so let's go ahead and open
that<00:01:50.130> first<00:01:50.399> maybe<00:01:51.000> we'll<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.420> good

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that first maybe we'll get some good

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
that first maybe we'll get some good
luck<00:01:51.750> let<00:01:51.899> me<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.170> down<00:01:52.350> into<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.950> angle

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
luck let me get down into a good angle

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
luck let me get down into a good angle
right<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.430> let's<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.390> into<00:01:54.540> our<00:01:54.600> first<00:01:54.960> pack

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
right here let's get into our first pack

of the day let's see if we can start

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080 
of the day let's see if we can start
things<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.740> super<00:01:59.430> nice<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.909> did<00:02:00.060> last

things off super nice like we did last
time<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.869> course<00:02:00.899> they'll<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.320> giving<00:02:01.409> you

time and of course they'll be giving you
guys<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> code<00:02:02.280> guards<00:02:02.579> there's<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
guys all the code guards there's the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.740 
guys all the code guards there's the
first<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:04.850> see<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.030> got<00:02:06.180> starting<00:02:06.630> off

car<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.390> pack<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.620> Kyogre<00:02:35.459> ocean

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
car to the pack it's a Kyogre ocean

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.440 
car to the pack it's a Kyogre ocean
cyclone<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.690> spring<00:02:37.050> tides<00:02:37.319> so<00:02:37.770> not<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> Kyogre

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
cyclone and spring tides so not a Kyogre

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.880 
cyclone and spring tides so not a Kyogre
primal<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:39.930> anything<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:40.800> I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
primal or anything like that I think I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.199 
primal or anything like that I think I
actually<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.430> prime<00:02:41.700> okay<00:02:41.940> overs

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
actually have to prime okay overs

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.930 
actually have to prime okay overs
already<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:42.989> really<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.550> beat<00:02:44.819> up

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
already so I really have not to beat up

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.570 
already so I really have not to beat up
about<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.330> getting<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.720> those<00:02:46.580> there's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
about not getting one of those there's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.890 
about not getting one of those there's
still<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.760> lot<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.060> cars<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.420> need<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> SEC

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
still a lot of cars I need in the SEC

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.720 
still a lot of cars I need in the SEC
though<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.260> probably<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> third<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.489> even<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
though I probably do a third or even a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.000 
though I probably do a third or even a
fourth<00:02:51.049> booster<00:02:52.049> box<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.560> crud<00:02:52.799> because

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
fourth booster box for this crud because

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.100 
fourth booster box for this crud because
there's<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.489> many<00:02:53.730> cards<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.930> we'll

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
there's just that many cards but we'll

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
there's just that many cards but we'll
see<00:02:55.350> there's<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.709> many<00:02:55.799> other<00:02:55.980> things<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.430> do

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
see there's so many other things to do

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.280 
see there's so many other things to do
than<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.940> doing<00:02:57.060> more<00:02:57.870> primal<00:02:58.200> clash

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
than just doing more primal clash

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.949 
than just doing more primal clash
booster<00:02:58.709> boxes<00:02:59.209> although<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> very

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
booster boxes although is it it's a very
