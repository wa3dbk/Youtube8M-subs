00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:12.400
 Well, first let's just 7 the Polar Sea 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:15.029
 650 can unpack then we must first 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.030
 by cutting the plasticje momentarily 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:23.980
 magnetic and it is connected so it 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.780
 looks very much the way you see and me 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.369
 have very a picture like this thing to 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.310
 the help who thinks it is another 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:38.469
 direct use that is of course about 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:40.949
 the poles and v6 50 and let's go with them 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.949
 pull out 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.699
 this is your first impression 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.899
 certainly not too heavy 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.309
 pretty thin and I think that's important 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.309
 on the wheel so 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.870
 thin wax and forefinger on anyway 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 my index finger 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 maybe a much better picture 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.700
 such a kitchen knife 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:19.990
 because he is just thinking like one 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 nice girl you just want it that red 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 button is suddenly visible 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.210
 forging graft harvest in itself already 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.299
 especially chic will be in the sun and me 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 recommend going towards the sun with 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 my new v6 50 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.320
 so if you are for object or board then 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 You see them pretty poles 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.750
 I think this is the battery 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 box so first impression 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.450
 nice to just pick it up and then look like this 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.220
 nice lock up 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.900
 I will make a separate video from 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.479
 set up all options 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.560
 first what we get even more 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.500
 this one 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.500
 poler bluetooth smart sensor so an h6 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.550
 nh 6 after the tight meter that I put on everywhere 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.870
 lie mine 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.870
 polar v800 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.590
 what others can or come to me v800 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.989
 but now I want him high the soft 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 strap if there is meter strap 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.390
 it looks swanky faster 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 net models 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.630
 so yes of course test some small more 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.120
 at the late cap the ordinary with 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.030
 micro-usb the easy system because yes 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.430
 nowadays almost everything is micro-usb 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.680
 so charge via the computer or eden 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.739
 wall socket 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.410
 so that's fine with your 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.410
 send initiative to start editing 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.180
 Well that is the way you will hopefully 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.180
 invariably 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.319
 that's really not like being in a whole 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.239
 rapid decrease in the chloe and then 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.549
 of course still good mounting rubbers 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:38.000
 go and what is beautiful is what i now draw qi 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.500
 And what you may have all of your questions is from 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.100
 against you now 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.100
 stem or on board i can do both 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.160
 because you see this just say so 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.280
 has two options for mounting 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.870
 so he can both be allowed on board 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.290
 like culture and that is beautiful in itself 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.459
 would be ok 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.640
 and the cookies but the pieces to now 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.290
 exciting I go see and other 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.970
 videos to extensively test him all that 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.040
 go through functions with a first one already 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.040
 picture of the new v6 50
