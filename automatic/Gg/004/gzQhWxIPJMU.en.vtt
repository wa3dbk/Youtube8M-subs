00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.030
 the beauty of the natural world and its 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.490
 contribution to the daily life of the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.790
 human beings is vital to be able to follow 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
 living in a calm and safe way 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.509
 unfortunately this beauty of the world 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 natural is threatened and affected 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.320
 direct way due to felling 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.900
 immoderate of trees and fires 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 forest data collected by the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.970
 conafor that is the national commission 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.030
 forestry notes that Mexico loses more than 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.739
 700 thousand hectares of forests per year 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 reflecting itself in the changes 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 climatic conditions that the country has 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 problem does not only affect nature 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 but also to the animal life since the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 forest fires are one of the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.850
 main reasons why some 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.160
 animals are in danger of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 extinction on the other hand logging 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.989
 immoderate trees is an activity 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.960
 highly practiced in our country and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.120
 even more so in states that go from the center to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.580
 south of the country since the vegetation in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.590
 these states has a large volume a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.590
 example of this is the state of morelos 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.160
 this afternoon to give some practice in 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.660
 the municipality of huitzilac morelos is a 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.860
 of the main activities for the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.000
 support of the families of this 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.500
 municipality 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.820
 Below is a 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.080
 interview that reveals how 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.080
 do this activity that is 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.540
 well we are here with Mr. Roger 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.640
 cortez lopez and offered to give us a 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.760
 interview to gather information 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.370
 about the immoderate felling of the forest 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.960
 Well, I'll start with a question to what 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.470
 dedicate 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.250
 I work in the field to work 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.140
 the wood three lines and does not fit the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.890
 field work more than anything as they say 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.780
 in clear felling clear good the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.460
 next question is what are the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.979
 main reasons to work in this 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.410
 medium the main reasons for 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.270
 work in this medium is because 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.760
 unfortunately it is here where we 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.740
 We live in this community for no no 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.709
 another type of work and we can not 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.300
 play in some factory or something 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.700
 because studies are required and but 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.850
 we did not have similar studies or 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 we devote we go to the mold good very 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.360
 well how often does this type of 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.850
 work 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.520
 Well, here we usually dedicate ourselves 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 of 34 days sometimes up to 5 days 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.140
 working the mountain and we are working 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.690
 45 days a week well what purposes do you have 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.490
 this type of activity so look at the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.710
 purposes that this type of activity has 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.600
 I do not know if for good or bad I know 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.150
 that we are committing the best some 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.340
 no crime but I think we do not have any 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.260
 more than working there we do not have as 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.250
 I say in another type of work 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.560
 perform well, what kind of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.170
 wooden way of internal rectum 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.090
 well here the kind of wood that 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.820
 it collects more the one that works the most is 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.400
 the locote the tree that is like that 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.220
 called ocote or this other that is called 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.900
 air for firewood for the stoves of 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.569
 here of the houses launching one selling 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.909
 the loads of firewood 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.629
 good part of your income 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.530
 represents this activity because of 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:26.709
 our income I think we must 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.409
 15 in 50 60 percent I think of what 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.750
 We won there, half of them, I believe what 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:37.110
 worth a tree onu I know it well 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.190
 another question and very important to clarify 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.920
 this question 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.890
 do you know the consequences of the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.870
 late in the stands of trees, if not 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.970
 we make this power even then we 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.650
 practice a lot of people there are many 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.380
 consequences like warming 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.080
 global there is no longer this there are no trees 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.550
 we no longer have vegetation and if so 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.040
 we affect the planet we 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.890
 we understand not clear but how do I repeat it 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.660
 we can work in one 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 we do not have studies unfortunately 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.650
 then the work that we can 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.210
 play nothing else is in the field now 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.800
 Well, I think a little less 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.740
 we work because if they already enter 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.019
 authorities and the truth is that it is not 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.630
 I know if the government instead of looking for us 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.340
 some kind of job out there because no no 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.110
 he gives us his hand and I tell him we do not have any 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.990
 more than working in the field the truth and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.780
 how do I explain again if we have 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.790
 said that we are affecting we no longer 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.640
 It rains like it did years ago 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.170
 years there was not much and now it is 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.840
 it does not even want to rain, it's already 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.880
 city â€‹â€‹time they changed the waters already 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.770
 we get ahead the times it does not rain and if 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.289
 we 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.270
 aware that we affect the planet 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.030
 in the end but what we do then 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.639
 if you can each a new case well here 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.889
 in this world and to keep the 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.199
 thank you very much yours as well 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.080
 after that, on the contrary, I say 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.810
 if I maybe feel a little pain 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.150
 going back to the way is going to hurt the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.340
 field the pardon of diego we do not have of 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.259
 another and well, yes, I hope they threw us out 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.000
 the hand out there this fund is not some 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.819
 program where we perform doing 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.229
 otherwise we would stop being alone 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.270
 in the mold table 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.270
 good good thank you very much for nothing 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.200
 this interview is a clear example of 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.600
 the reasons why it is done 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.460
 said activity activities 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.350
 they register that 90 percent of the 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.940
 tree felling in our country is not 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.550
 controlled by the authorities 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.220
 respective and this is something negative for 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.960
 our forests since the activity does not 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.420
 is controlled and the facts for 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.780
 counteract this activity are very 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.510
 few since they are reforested only 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.680
 10,000 hectares of forests per year in 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.100
 our country 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.020
 this activity greatly affects the 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.960
 climate change and that is why 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.300
 conducted an interview to try to 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.370
 know how this activity alters 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.370
 climate change 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.370
 good afternoon we find the 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.370
 graduate 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.270
 with the theme that you have 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.270
 of immoderate felling 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.850
 well that the immoderate felling of trees 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:24.510
 it is a global evil and it is 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:27.870
 obviously causing pollution 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.129
 or one on pollution at the level 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.860
 world 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:34.649
 and as a consequence obviously 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.050
 an overheating that is not 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:40.790
 then affecting the changes 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:46.460
 obviously of 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:49.450
 of climates tragedies of tsunamis 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.450
 etcetera etcetera 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.610
 good 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.280
 in what way do you think that logging 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.770
 immoderate trees 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.200
 forest fires affect the change 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.230
 climate 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.830
 and as I mentioned that immoderate logging 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:15.650
 of trees unfortunately what we 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.730
 Remove that oxygenation because the trees 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.730
 produce oxygen 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:27.520
 due 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:30.370
 unfortunately, with situations 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.580
 and irregular legal that 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.229
 unfortunately there are no legislations 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.210
 enough and punishments to people 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.610
 who are engaged in this immoderate logging of 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:43.599
 trees and they sell the part of the 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:48.320
 trees that take years and years to grow 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:50.540
 they sell them at nothing economically 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.830
 the immoderate felling of trees is without 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.080
 doubt an activity that threatens the 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.420
 planet and the integrity of us the 

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.640
 human beings and therefore the decision of 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.500
 put an end to this threat is ours the 

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.460
 time to act and see for a future more 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.460
 safe and green
