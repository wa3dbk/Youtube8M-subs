00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
see what the DSG shift logic is down a

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:18.160 
see what the DSG shift logic is down a
hill

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.490 

and<00:00:18.500> we'll<00:00:18.680> kind<00:00:18.859> of<00:00:19.010> let<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.189> fly<00:00:19.550> down<00:00:20.349> if<00:00:21.349> you

get on the brakes that shove the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.120 
get on the brakes that shove the
downshift<00:00:23.289> is<00:00:24.289> it

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
just to give an idea the torque I'm

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.090 
just to give an idea the torque I'm
going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.110> put<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.350> sixth<00:01:01.680> gear<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.010> the

going to put it in sixth gear in the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:12.930 
going to put it in sixth gear in the
floor

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.630 

12m<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.110> put<00:01:15.260> in<00:01:15.350> 6th<00:01:15.710> gear<00:01:15.890> around<00:01:16.159> 31

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
12m you can put in 6th gear around 31

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.780 
12m you can put in 6th gear around 31
miles<00:01:16.850> an<00:01:17.090> hour<00:01:18.580> foot<00:01:19.580> down<00:01:19.820> all<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.479> way<00:01:20.770> look

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
miles an hour foot down all the way look

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.520 
miles an hour foot down all the way look
okay<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.820> well<00:01:23.150> downshift<00:01:23.870> when<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.200> put<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.440> in

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
okay a well downshift when you put it in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.170 
okay a well downshift when you put it in
manual<00:01:24.650> mud

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
manual mud

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.330 
manual mud
maybe<00:01:26.720> do<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.020> faster<00:01:27.440> now

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.359 

I<00:01:34.170> thought<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.350> wouldn't<00:01:35.590> down<00:01:36.159> but<00:01:36.310> I

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
I thought it wouldn't down but I

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.039 
I thought it wouldn't down but I
guess<00:01:36.579> it<00:01:36.789> well<00:01:36.969> if<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.270> really<00:01:37.570> put<00:01:37.899> your

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
guess it well if you really put your

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.599 
guess it well if you really put your
foot<00:01:38.109> only<00:01:38.649> if<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.829> put<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.130> right<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.369> the

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
foot only if you put it right to the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.930 
foot only if you put it right to the
floor<00:01:39.789> will<00:01:40.149> it<00:01:40.270> kick<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.659> down

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.790 

but<00:01:45.940> I'm<00:01:46.120> pretty<00:01:46.390> sure<00:01:46.510> if<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.870> do<00:01:47.050> it<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.320> did

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
but I'm pretty sure if you do it I did

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.440 
but I'm pretty sure if you do it I did
it<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.040> other<00:01:48.070> day<00:01:48.430> in<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.760> car<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.360> it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
it the other day in the car and it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.230 
it the other day in the car and it
didn't<00:01:49.750> downshift<00:01:50.730> but<00:01:51.730> I<00:01:51.820> was<00:01:51.940> going<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
didn't downshift but I was going a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.060 
didn't downshift but I was going a
little<00:01:52.330> fast<00:01:52.690> or<00:01:52.960> tonight<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.620> didn't<00:01:53.950> like

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
little fast or tonight and I didn't like

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.680 
little fast or tonight and I didn't like
you<00:01:54.190> know<00:01:54.280> shove<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.880> pedal<00:01:55.150> as<00:01:55.270> hard<00:01:55.300> as<00:01:55.570> I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
you know shove the pedal as hard as I

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.140 
you know shove the pedal as hard as I
that's<00:01:55.900> good
