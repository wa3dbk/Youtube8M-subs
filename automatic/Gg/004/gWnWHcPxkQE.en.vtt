in<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> tablespoon<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> stuff<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
in a tablespoon of this stuff which I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.940 
in a tablespoon of this stuff which I
love<00:01:45.240> which<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:47.000> antioxidant<00:01:48.000> blend<00:01:48.180> powder

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
love which is a antioxidant blend powder

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.929 
love which is a antioxidant blend powder
particularly<00:01:49.950> through<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.549> movie

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
particularly through that in this movie

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
particularly through that in this movie
because<00:01:51.060> i'm<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:51.630> using<00:01:52.009> berries<00:01:53.009> like

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
because i'm not using berries like

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.679 
because i'm not using berries like
sometimes<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
sometimes i would which is where you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.940 
sometimes i would which is where you
know<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:55.020> antioxidants<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> come

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
know your antioxidants are going to come

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.730 
know your antioxidants are going to come

to dehydration your body uses water to

to dehydration your body uses water to
metabolize<00:03:22.320> protein<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.250> too<00:03:23.370> much

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
metabolize protein so we have too much

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.060 
metabolize protein so we have too much
you<00:03:23.790> might<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.120> using<00:03:24.630> your<00:03:24.840> water<00:03:25.080> sources<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you might be using your water sources to

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.830 
you might be using your water sources to
try<00:03:26.250> metabolize<00:03:26.790> excess<00:03:27.090> protein<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.780> if

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
try metabolize excess protein and if

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.300 
try metabolize excess protein and if
you're<00:03:27.959> dehydrated<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.709> also<00:03:28.890> ain't<00:03:29.160> going

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
you're dehydrated you also ain't going

you're dehydrated you also ain't going

to train very well so really some

to train very well so really some
important<00:03:31.470> things<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.739> consider<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:33.269> would

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
important things to consider and I would

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.240
