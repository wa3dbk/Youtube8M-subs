which<00:00:30.120> I<00:00:31.279> have<00:00:32.279> been<00:00:32.520> using<00:00:32.790> since<00:00:33.210> August<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
which I have been using since August and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.680 
which I have been using since August and
it's<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> end<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.879> November

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
it's now kind of the end of November

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.090 
it's now kind of the end of November
so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.890> had<00:00:38.400> a<00:00:39.320> fair<00:00:40.320> amount<00:00:40.740> of<00:00:40.860> time

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so I have had a fair amount of time

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
so I have had a fair amount of time
using<00:00:41.400> it<00:00:41.730> even<00:00:42.390> though<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.570> need<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
using it even though you need to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
using it even though you need to
consider<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> fact<00:00:43.560> that<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.040> only<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.340> once

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
consider the fact that you only use once

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
consider the fact that you only use once
every<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.180> weeks<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.630> means<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.110> only<00:00:46.410> use

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
every two weeks which means you only use

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.750 
every two weeks which means you only use
it<00:00:46.940> twice<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.239> month<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:50.160> started

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.379 
hairs kind of a lot more sparse under my
arms<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:35.030> pretty<00:03:35.599> great<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.620> mean<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.430> it's

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
arms is pretty great I mean it's it's

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.259 
arms is pretty great I mean it's it's
very<00:03:38.709> it's<00:03:39.709> hard<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.250> tell<00:03:40.459> really<00:03:40.910> because<00:03:41.180> I

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
very it's hard to tell really because I

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.000 
very it's hard to tell really because I
can't<00:03:41.510> exactly<00:03:41.900> remember<00:03:42.109> what<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.859> was<00:03:42.920> like

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
can't exactly remember what it was like

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.580 
can't exactly remember what it was like
before<00:03:43.340> but<00:03:44.239> generally<00:03:44.780> speaking<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.560> think

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
before but generally speaking I think

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.979 
before but generally speaking I think
that<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.819> has<00:03:47.060> made<00:03:47.299> quite<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.569> big<00:03:47.810> difference

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
that it has made quite a big difference

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.670 
that it has made quite a big difference
and<00:03:48.560> I've<00:03:49.340> been<00:03:49.609> able<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.389> as<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.840> said<00:03:51.049> go<00:03:51.319> for<00:03:51.650> a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
and I've been able to as I said go for a

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.339 
and I've been able to as I said go for a
long<00:03:52.040> period<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.430> time<00:03:52.609> without<00:03:52.880> shaving<00:03:53.720> so

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
long period of time without shaving so

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.979 
long period of time without shaving so
that's<00:03:54.620> been<00:03:54.859> really<00:03:55.040> really<00:03:55.250> great<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:56.120> you

generally speaking on my legs I don't
really<00:05:22.910> feel<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.210> anymore<00:05:23.570> isn't<00:05:23.930> that

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
painful and so arms is still very

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.050 
painful and so arms is still very
painful<00:05:27.100> but<00:05:28.100> it's<00:05:28.250> manageable<00:05:28.430> it's<00:05:28.820> only<00:05:28.970> a

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
painful but it's manageable it's only a

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.850 
painful but it's manageable it's only a
small<00:05:29.300> area<00:05:29.510> it<00:05:29.780> doesn't<00:05:29.930> take<00:05:30.169> very<00:05:30.200> long<00:05:30.440> and

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
small area it doesn't take very long and

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.330 
small area it doesn't take very long and
I've<00:05:31.790> also<00:05:32.600> been<00:05:33.260> using<00:05:33.320> on<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.950> highest

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
I've also been using on the highest

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.480 
I've also been using on the highest
setting<00:05:35.300> as<00:05:35.450> well<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:35.960> on<00:05:36.169> number<00:05:36.590> five<00:05:36.830> which

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
setting as well so on number five which

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.460 
setting as well so on number five which
is<00:05:37.520> kind<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.090> maximum<00:05:38.300> strength<00:05:38.900> setting

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
is kind of the maximum strength setting

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.930 
is kind of the maximum strength setting
because<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.890> just<00:05:40.100> think<00:05:40.280> if<00:05:40.400> I'm<00:05:40.520> going<00:05:40.730> to<00:05:40.820> do

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
because I just think if I'm going to do

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.240 
because I just think if I'm going to do
it<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.090> want<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.330> do<00:05:41.419> it<00:05:41.510> properly<00:05:41.690> so<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.800> haven't

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
it I want to do it properly so I haven't

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.520 
it I want to do it properly so I haven't
missed<00:05:43.340> out<00:05:43.550> any<00:05:43.730> sessions<00:05:44.240> I<00:05:44.450> haven't<00:05:44.990> been

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
missed out any sessions I haven't been

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.550 
missed out any sessions I haven't been
kind<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:45.860> skipping<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.760> I<00:05:47.690> will<00:05:48.260> do

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
kind of skipping it and I will do

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.409 
kind of skipping it and I will do
another<00:05:48.830> kind<00:05:49.100> of<00:05:49.190> update<00:05:49.580> video<00:05:49.880> once<00:05:50.150> I'm

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
another kind of update video once I'm

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.200 
another kind of update video once I'm
done<00:05:50.630> with<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.900> entire<00:05:51.169> process<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.310> let<00:05:53.060> you

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
done with the entire process and let you

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.320 
done with the entire process and let you
know<00:05:53.360> if<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.780> am<00:05:53.900> absolutely<00:05:54.350> hair<00:05:54.620> free<00:05:54.890> or<00:05:55.040> not

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
know if I am absolutely hair free or not

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.670 
know if I am absolutely hair free or not
as<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.540> said<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:56.780> do<00:05:56.960> think<00:05:57.320> you'll<00:05:57.440> take<00:05:57.650> a

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
as I said I do think you'll take a

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.860 
as I said I do think you'll take a
little<00:05:57.860> bit<00:05:58.040> longer

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
little bit longer

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.780 
little bit longer
and<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.230> anticipated<00:05:59.949> I<00:06:00.040> don't<00:06:00.280> think<00:06:00.370> six

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
and I anticipated I don't think six

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.879 
and I anticipated I don't think six
months<00:06:00.880> will<00:06:01.510> cut<00:06:01.750> it<00:06:01.870> I<00:06:01.990> think<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.530> needs<00:06:02.740> to

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
months will cut it I think it needs to

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.290 
months will cut it I think it needs to
be<00:06:02.980> a<00:06:03.100> little<00:06:03.370> bit<00:06:03.460> longer<00:06:03.639> for<00:06:03.910> me<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.120> see

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
be a little bit longer for me to see

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.570 
be a little bit longer for me to see
really<00:06:04.570> permanent<00:06:05.139> results<00:06:05.800> because<00:06:06.340> at<00:06:06.460> the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
really permanent results because at the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.760 
really permanent results because at the
moment<00:06:06.639> after<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.990> know<00:06:08.169> a<00:06:08.199> couple<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.590> days

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
moment after you know a couple of days

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.010 
moment after you know a couple of days
of<00:06:08.979> shaving<00:06:09.490> then<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.180> can<00:06:10.330> still<00:06:10.570> kind<00:06:10.870> of

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
of shaving then you can still kind of

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.400 
of shaving then you can still kind of
feel<00:06:11.260> it<00:06:11.290> and<00:06:12.060> I've<00:06:13.060> got<00:06:13.360> a<00:06:13.540> feeling<00:06:14.110> my<00:06:14.139> leg

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
feel it and I've got a feeling my leg

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.050 
feel it and I've got a feeling my leg
right<00:06:14.650> here<00:06:14.680> sometimes<00:06:15.310> with<00:06:15.550> but<00:06:15.970> I'm

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
right here sometimes with but I'm

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.310 
right here sometimes with but I'm
feeling<00:06:16.300> my<00:06:16.630> leg<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:17.080> I<00:06:17.470> shaved<00:06:17.860> my<00:06:18.040> legs<00:06:18.190> on

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
feeling my leg and I shaved my legs on

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.100 
feeling my leg and I shaved my legs on
Monday<00:06:20.320> and<00:06:21.000> you<00:06:22.000> can<00:06:22.180> kind<00:06:22.449> of<00:06:22.510> feel<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:22.840> little

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
Monday and you can kind of feel a little

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.050 
Monday and you can kind of feel a little
bit<00:06:23.320> of<00:06:23.440> prettiness<00:06:23.800> but<00:06:24.400> I'm<00:06:24.490> not<00:06:24.639> sure<00:06:24.880> if

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
bit of prettiness but I'm not sure if

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.120 
bit of prettiness but I'm not sure if
that's<00:06:25.300> just<00:06:25.449> what<00:06:26.020> comes<00:06:26.260> with<00:06:26.590> shaving

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
that's just what comes with shaving

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.189 
that's just what comes with shaving
because<00:06:27.430> as<00:06:27.580> I<00:06:27.729> said<00:06:27.970> I'm<00:06:28.180> not<00:06:28.360> really<00:06:28.540> someone

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
because as I said I'm not really someone

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.790 
because as I said I'm not really someone
who<00:06:29.669> shaves<00:06:30.669> very<00:06:31.060> often<00:06:31.479> on<00:06:31.660> my<00:06:31.690> leg<00:06:31.930> area<00:06:32.139> so

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
who shaves very often on my leg area so

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.770 
who shaves very often on my leg area so
the<00:06:32.919> shaving<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.400> absolutely<00:06:33.940> killing<00:06:34.180> me<00:06:34.360> and

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
the shaving is absolutely killing me and

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.440 
the shaving is absolutely killing me and
I<00:06:35.350> will<00:06:35.650> be<00:06:35.800> super<00:06:36.340> happy<00:06:36.490> once<00:06:36.880> this<00:06:37.150> has<00:06:37.330> done

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450

it anymore
because<00:06:39.970> I<00:06:40.180> absolutely<00:06:40.240> detest<00:06:41.100> shaving<00:06:42.100> but
