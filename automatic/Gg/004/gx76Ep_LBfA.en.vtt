that's because onstage sometimes you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
that's because onstage sometimes you
over<00:00:39.540> create<00:00:39.840> atmosphere<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.710> many<00:00:40.860> ways

that but that immersion we expected not

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
that but that immersion we expected not
of<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> movies<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> depth<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.000> focus<00:00:54.149> that

of out of movies the depth of focus that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
of out of movies the depth of focus that
you<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.110> certain<00:00:55.469> lenses<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you get on certain lenses that use it on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
you get on certain lenses that use it on
on<00:00:56.789> certain<00:00:57.120> lenses<00:00:57.239> when<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> shoot<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.079> an

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
on certain lenses when you shoot like an

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.750 
on certain lenses when you shoot like an
over-the-shoulder<00:00:58.859> conversation<00:00:59.609> between

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
over-the-shoulder conversation between

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180 
over-the-shoulder conversation between
two<00:00:59.910> characters<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:01.230> totally<00:01:01.559> expected<00:01:02.010> but

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
two characters you totally expected but

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
two characters you totally expected but
in<00:01:02.609> games<00:01:02.910> well<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> tendency<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> actually

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in games well the tendency to actually

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.570 
in games well the tendency to actually
have<00:01:04.049> both<00:01:04.229> characters<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> Christ<00:01:05.339> not

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
have both characters kind of Christ not

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.010 
have both characters kind of Christ not
there's<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> little<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.479> blur<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.689> not

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
there's a little bit of a blur but not

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
there's a little bit of a blur but not
really<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.560> far<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.250> dramatic<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
really that far that it's dramatic the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
really that far that it's dramatic the
reason<00:01:09.900> why<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.170> adhere<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
reason why we adhere to that is that it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.620 
reason why we adhere to that is that it
was<00:01:11.280> interesting<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> take<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.450> things

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
was interesting to take these things

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.700 
was interesting to take these things
that<00:01:12.689> people<00:01:13.049> accept<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.250> movies<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
that people accept now in movies and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
that people accept now in movies and
normally<00:01:16.710> accept<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.250> expecting<00:01:17.880> movies<00:01:18.119> if

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
normally accept but expecting movies if

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.789 
normally accept but expecting movies if
it<00:01:18.689> wasn't<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.229> people<00:01:19.470> will<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.650> like

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it wasn't there now people will go like

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
it wasn't there now people will go like
wow<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.280> strange<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.450> I'm

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
wow that was strange that's not what I'm

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
wow that was strange that's not what I'm
used<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.380> couldn't<00:01:22.590> tell<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> why<00:01:23.070> but

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
used to they couldn't tell you why but

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.320 
used to they couldn't tell you why but
they<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.729> definitely<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.299> that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
they could definitely see that

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
they could definitely see that
something's<00:01:24.900> missing<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:26.250> funnily<00:01:26.580> enough

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
something's missing now funnily enough

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.060 
something's missing now funnily enough
after<00:01:27.299> showing<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.810> showed<00:01:27.960> today

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
after showing what we showed today

after showing what we showed today
somebody<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.189> asked<00:01:29.700> me<00:01:29.820> earlier<00:01:29.850> like

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
oh you know what I don't know why but I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
oh you know what I don't know why but I
felt<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.060> was<00:01:33.299> more<00:01:33.509> immersive<00:01:33.780> out

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
felt like this was more immersive out

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.450 
felt like this was more immersive out
there<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.470> filming<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.189> get
