things<00:02:53.540> correct<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:53.989> drag<00:02:54.379> boats<00:02:54.799> that's<00:02:55.189> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
things correct so drag boats that's the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.300 
things correct so drag boats that's the
word<00:02:55.579> so<00:02:56.180> here<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.689> is<00:02:56.950> Kendra's<00:02:57.950> wanting<00:02:58.220> to

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
word so here it is Kendra's wanting to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:15.160 
word so here it is Kendra's wanting to
try<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.519> skip<00:02:58.790> rocks<00:03:13.569> so<00:03:14.569> what<00:03:14.720> did<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.900> do<00:03:15.049> on

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
try to skip rocks so what did you do on

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.309 
try to skip rocks so what did you do on
vacation<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.940> almost<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.720> didn't<00:03:18.019> even<00:03:18.139> make

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
vacation you almost you didn't even make

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:26.710 
vacation you almost you didn't even make
it<00:03:18.500> into<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.799> water<00:03:25.389> okay<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:26.420> he's

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
it into the water okay so he's

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.390 
it into the water okay so he's
explaining<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.319> us<00:03:27.439> what<00:03:27.470> kind<00:03:27.859> of<00:03:27.920> variables

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
explaining to us what kind of variables

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.940 
explaining to us what kind of variables
they<00:03:28.549> look<00:03:28.760> at<00:03:28.909> to<00:03:29.090> determine<00:03:29.209> how<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.769> race

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
they look at to determine how to race

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.979 
they look at to determine how to race
the<00:03:31.189> race<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:31.819> like<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.269> science<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.870> this

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
the race and it's like a science to this

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.599 
the race and it's like a science to this
it's<00:03:33.230> not<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.769> push<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.220> pedal<00:03:34.459> as

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
it's not just like push the pedal as

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.759 
it's not just like push the pedal as
fast<00:03:34.639> as<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.090> can<00:03:35.239> go<00:03:35.389> yeah<00:03:35.750> there<00:03:35.959> you

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
fast as you can go yeah there you

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.770 
fast as you can go yeah there you
basically<00:03:36.920> have<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.459> be<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.579> weatherman<00:03:37.939> to<00:03:38.629> do

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
basically have to be a weatherman to do

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.159 
basically have to be a weatherman to do
this<00:03:38.930> race<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.590> learned<00:03:39.859> just<00:03:39.980> from<00:03:40.190> uncle<00:03:40.430> Jeff

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
this race I learned just from uncle Jeff

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.330 
this race I learned just from uncle Jeff
so<00:03:42.169> yeah<00:03:42.319> so<00:03:42.470> here's<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.769> weather<00:03:42.919> station

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
so yeah so here's the weather station

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.470 
so yeah so here's the weather station
which<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.519> hooked<00:03:43.790> up<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:44.030> our<00:03:44.060> sensors

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
which is hooked up to our sensors

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.729 
which is hooked up to our sensors
outside<00:03:44.629> the<00:03:44.930> trailer<00:03:45.139> if<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:45.470> look<00:03:45.620> down

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
outside the trailer if you look down

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.650 
outside the trailer if you look down
here<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.980> can<00:03:46.099> see<00:03:46.220> has<00:03:46.400> all<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.760> big

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
here you can see has all the big

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.330 
here you can see has all the big
information<00:03:48.199> like<00:03:48.319> barometer<00:03:48.769> temperature

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
information like barometer temperature

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.619 
information like barometer temperature
salinity<00:03:51.010> vapor<00:03:52.010> pressure<00:03:52.280> water<00:03:52.669> grades<00:03:53.060> so

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
salinity vapor pressure water grades so

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.670 
salinity vapor pressure water grades so
as<00:03:54.199> that<00:03:54.829> weather<00:03:55.099> changes<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.989> engines<00:03:57.440> make

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
as that weather changes the engines make

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.740 
as that weather changes the engines make
more<00:03:57.980> or<00:03:58.129> less<00:03:58.280> horsepower<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.239> Kyle<00:03:59.480> is<00:03:59.720> a

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
more or less horsepower so Kyle is a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.750 
more or less horsepower so Kyle is a
master<00:04:00.319> at<00:04:00.349> reaction<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.129> because<00:04:01.489> there's<00:04:01.699> a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
master at reaction so because there's a

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.670 
master at reaction so because there's a
tree<00:04:02.180> with<00:04:02.209> lights<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.959> when<00:04:03.199> it<00:04:03.290> hits<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
tree with lights and when it hits the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.439 
tree with lights and when it hits the
bottom<00:04:03.829> light<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.519> when<00:04:04.729> you<00:04:04.879> go<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.090> it

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
bottom light is when you go and it

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.300 
bottom light is when you go and it
matters<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.229> do<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.530> fast<00:04:06.739> enough<00:04:06.919> so

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
matters that you do it fast enough so

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.979 
matters that you do it fast enough so
growing<00:04:07.609> up<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:07.909> remember<00:04:07.970> Kyle<00:04:08.510> had<00:04:08.750> one<00:04:08.900> of

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
growing up I remember Kyle had one of

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.869 
growing up I remember Kyle had one of
those<00:04:09.079> trees<00:04:09.409> in<00:04:09.560> his<00:04:09.709> room<00:04:09.949> and<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:10.549> remember

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
those trees in his room and I remember

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.460 
those trees in his room and I remember
going<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.180> practicing<00:04:11.720> like<00:04:11.930> against<00:04:12.319> him

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
going and practicing like against him

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.990 
going and practicing like against him
and<00:04:12.620> he

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
and I was like oh I couldn't do it it

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.729 
and I was like oh I couldn't do it it
has<00:04:16.360> been<00:04:16.660> racing<00:04:16.959> since<00:04:17.320> he<00:04:17.440> was<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.590> little

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
has been racing since he was a little

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.229 
has been racing since he was a little
kid<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.010> mean<00:04:18.190> he<00:04:18.310> was<00:04:18.459> 12<00:04:18.700> years<00:04:18.820> old<00:04:19.000> and

like<00:04:55.889> going<00:04:56.889> to<00:04:57.009> town

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
like going to town

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.160 
like going to town
she's<00:04:58.990> research-driven

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.590 

we're<00:05:03.560> in<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.800> RV<00:05:04.160> Cal's<00:05:04.520> RV<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.270> he's

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
we're in the RV Cal's RV and he's

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.720 
we're in the RV Cal's RV and he's
actually<00:05:05.810> racing<00:05:06.500> Ryan<00:05:07.430> over<00:05:08.030> there<00:05:08.270> so<00:05:09.230> uh

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
actually racing Ryan over there so uh
