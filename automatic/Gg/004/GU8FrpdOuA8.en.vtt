00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.770
 further for whom there are different 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.539
 Variations call for as before any hero 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.270

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.309
 things worth observing a few 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.890

 and also do not interfere wards cheers 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.500
 further we recommend to collect magic 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.900
 wand as he will not be superfluous 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.350
 of shoes, the obvious choice will be 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 organs so solved problems with mana you and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.930
 your team members 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.490
 you will also need blink dagger urn 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.770
 for the treatment and also the mechanism 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.890
 now let's talk about the name and on the situation 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.860
 for example you will need Vladimir for 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.550
 its useful aura of vampirism as well 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.640
 armor for you and your allies 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.990
 to increase your survival you 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.399
 you can first collect 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.380
 for example wangu and after taras if 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.630
 want to go deep in a tank worth 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.560
 ponder such art them from trouble mail and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.979
 Aleppo and its important to remember 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.470
 a few simple things you need to keep track of 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.500
 card player may need your 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.370
 which drives can sometimes save lives 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.890
 don't forget that your disks also 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.680
 you can swim health of your product 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.829
 the enemies were pretty surprised that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.290
 I almost destroyed noggin will stand with 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.019
 full hp 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.989
 he ate the trend and such ulta mirana but 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.549
 with its pluses and minuses being in 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.650
 her protector can use 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.760
 and use almost any skill and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.489
 almost all items your allies are not 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.290
 can this business do not forget 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.280
 first skill works only near 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 losing before kneading is desirable to throw 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.900
 his if possible your inviz 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.010
 the members will add an item to you 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.120
 surprises of course massive camp 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.880
 for 4.5 seconds will also be quite good 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.480
 As for the second skill besides 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 slowdown and obvious damage it also 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.549
 feasible ready being near 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.810
 the purpose 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.900
 returning to the third skill 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.379
 I want to remind that it still reduces 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.800
 take damage and throw it for example 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.810
 on the tank would be very helpful get used 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.830
 for him to play knowing these simple rules 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.769
 it will be very simple now move on to 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.019
 trend in the role of Keri, of course, many if 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.480
 not nearly everyone is used to seeing in it 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.110
 only support unless rushed in 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.440
 eyes his damage however over the course of the raid 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:46.349
 it leveled off and so what 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.349
 Frank Gehry and how to play for him and 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.310
 consider to start it ski you from 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.989
 another view 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.799
 The first skill in the role created only for 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.260
 an ally used by him can 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.989
 get big bonuses such as 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.450
 movement speed and use 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.500
 skills or items and ambushes 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.750
 second skill gives slowdowns and archives and 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.700
 around with that strings of the game 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.830
 this damage is already quite noticeable 3 skill 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.220
 just enough to throw over and 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.440
 reduce battle damage for 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.000
 a good start would be nice to buy 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:35.930
 hatchet to farm glove for strength and 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:41.730
 crown and also there and you need to choose 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:45.620
 focusing on the course the choice of boot drops 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.849
 into phases so when they won't give us 24 damage 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.419
 then from gloves we are going to take 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.089
 dismal election useful 0 who are you and 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.129
 your type 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:00.330
 You can also collect a halberd which 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:03.419
 will give you dodge health and damage and 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.279
 once for attack speed and pro not 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:13.080
 the roulette is perfect 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.080
 arta you anything tran 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.229
 in conclusion, you can highlight its advantages and 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.110
 cons namely dread roller or yes and in 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.769
 principle you will shoot problems with 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.179
 mana and very seriously what is at the beginning of the game 

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:30.219
 and noticeably affect 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:33.029
 you support he has a good margin 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:36.939
 embarrassed by the same easy to use 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:39.339
 not a rocker what else can you add 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.499
 that he has very significant damage in 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:47.409
 the beginning of the game it is possible 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:49.839
 develop well thank you all for watching 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.889
