00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello s not effective 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.030
 we see in this video I want to present an application that allows to 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 earn money 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.440
 on 20 n listing and fans via twitter by it's in view of this friendship but 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.159
 it's better 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.649
 I'll explain why 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.939
 so many people do not know how 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 she claims emerging and I'm going to explain 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.839
 it's good it's simple and at the same time it's hard 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.640
 because it takes 4 everywhere 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.430
 the application on a pro model and so e the principle that broke out the most 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.760
 possible harm 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.990
 to beat a score and annihilate 250 dollars 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.540
 this can come in the month 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.350
 they know 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 the game 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.460
 and do not speak for you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.050
 you will benefit 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.490
 Deraa 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.020
 the little girl 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.220
 p 250 of art 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.550
 it was not about believing but it's like that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.010
 so why is it so much money 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.420
 and after I will give a follow up to what will help you 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.890
 to beat your score it's easier I found on the fire 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 and with that night 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.720
 for me 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.420
 so the record to beat and 319 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.840
 socotra football club spams my record 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 this 250 dollars not bad sweden 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.450
 try 5 220 jean-marc by the yard 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.370
 go in the alphabet if you have not 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.370
 joel I think you could buy if you follow improve returns 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.370
 I often use the survivors 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 alas we will go 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.270
 we are talking here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.880
 we will go to the var 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.870
 and then we will find nautical miles internship at moby passage to their mobile 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.950
 go to the application 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.540
 the little trick so little go in settings on the bottom left 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.670
 if you have not ticked what I coached there 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 tick 2 so no military title title applications 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.810
 this preference 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.679
 and often question of society that I did 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.879
 So here you are doing here and there where elsewhere in the world explanations 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.709
 the shoot shots of belcourt 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.010
 you're going to fall in too much then you're going to have a bunch of photos 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.559
 and delete it popeye to shoot 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.760
 to perpetuate it coppel the epic three maybe four maybe 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.079
 five years 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.879
 of course removed and there 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.679
 remove the sacrificed 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 and you go back here this warned parish 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.959
 and then we'll remember that on such profiles and stylish unlike 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.689
 it's much easier obviously 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.739
 it's Cecilia 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.719
 so the best way to say 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.139
 that looks what happens when were awarded they are no longer 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.849
 visible 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.239
 that's not what did not do 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.409
 momar march will have the opportunity to go wrong but they are still there but 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.259
 we only see the pen duick iii the clip 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:12.189
 so that's really the simplest could you pettersson's 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.339
 competition after a month's rent 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:18.579
 beyond the deadline initially the bubbles that mingle ptt what 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.539
 worries the bombs 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.070
 posted 7 to 6 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.959
 so to make money 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.959
 by account it's very hard 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.219
 the day before m 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:29.899
 there is 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:31.589
 in the case m 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.269
 the child 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.810
 the media talk about me I had to look you had to be happy 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539

 and I explained to him how 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.569
 that it's easier actually 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.659
 in the article it's such a rescue to show you that in addition as a 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.809
 reorganization 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.809
 she with her acceptance and credible rarely 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.899
