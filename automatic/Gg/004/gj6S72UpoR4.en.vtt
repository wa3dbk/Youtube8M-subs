00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it's you skate backwards all we're going

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.310 
it's you skate backwards all we're going
to<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.309> is<00:00:57.550> mirror<00:00:57.969> that<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.930> we're<00:00:59.109> going<00:00:59.260> to

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
to do is mirror that and we're going to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.049 
to do is mirror that and we're going to
do<00:00:59.409> an<00:00:59.530> upside-down<00:01:00.010> V<00:01:00.370> shape

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
do an upside-down V shape

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.910 
do an upside-down V shape
so<00:01:01.329> your<00:01:01.479> toes<00:01:01.690> are<00:01:01.899> touching<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.530> your<00:01:02.710> heels

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
so your toes are touching and your heels

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.010 
so your toes are touching and your heels
are<00:01:03.070> pointing

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
are pointing

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.350 
are pointing
at<00:01:04.560> these<00:01:04.740> early<00:01:04.800> stages<00:01:05.370> we<00:01:05.730> might<00:01:05.940> find<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
at these early stages we might find it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
at these early stages we might find it
easiest<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.840> hold<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.410> French<00:01:07.740> shoulder

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
easiest to hold on to a French shoulder

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.780 
easiest to hold on to a French shoulder
or<00:01:08.730> a<00:01:08.790> sturdy<00:01:09.270> object<00:01:10.220> trying<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> keep<00:01:11.550> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
or a sturdy object trying to keep that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.750 
or a sturdy object trying to keep that
upside<00:01:12.240> down<00:01:12.270> V<00:01:12.690> shape<00:01:13.010> slowly<00:01:14.010> move<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.670> step

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
upside down V shape slowly move one step

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780 
upside down V shape slowly move one step
