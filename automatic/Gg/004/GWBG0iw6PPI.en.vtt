00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.449 

and<00:02:02.869> I'm<00:02:03.869> guessing<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> saw<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
and I'm guessing because I saw the

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.169 
and I'm guessing because I saw the
YouTube<00:02:07.489> information<00:02:08.489> channel<00:02:08.819> about<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
YouTube information channel about this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
YouTube information channel about this
and<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:10.080> guess<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.590> your<00:02:10.709> tripod<00:02:10.950> goes

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and I guess is where your tripod goes

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.410 
and I guess is where your tripod goes
but<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:12.060> tripod<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.290> not<00:02:13.579> this<00:02:14.579> small<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
but my tripod is not this small so I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.080 
but my tripod is not this small so I
guess<00:02:15.810> I'm<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.040> using<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.489> so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
guess I'm not going to be using that so

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.830 
guess I'm not going to be using that so
yeah

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
yeah

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.380

attachment<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.500> part<00:03:01.769> or<00:03:02.609> you
