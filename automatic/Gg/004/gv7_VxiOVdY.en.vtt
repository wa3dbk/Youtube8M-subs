00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 very good today you are seeing here with the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.690
 super wig super super super ugly mega 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.160
 very ugly ugly ugly the wig the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 that costs me because I'm going to make a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.609
 cut in the gold play in follow by 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.410
 will be bloated or by facebook you will know what 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.600
 which is if not because of good ones 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 image is of the skyline is one of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 races that are in the cairo the idea is 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.300
 simple I want to make the case that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.330
 represents that game with nature yes 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.769
 the one with the horns I love that helmet and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.489
 one of the ones I like the most about lezkairu 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.380
 and look what is a bit and what comes with 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.800
 much better but it is the one that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.809
 I like it 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 this time what I'm going to do is teach 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.220
 how the pattern is made one of the parties 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.800
 one of the body parts in this 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.050
 case in the head this this method what 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.739
 you can use for any part of the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.870
 body 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.960
 we are going to need this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 bad that the albal paper of all the life and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.769
 some type of ribbon bodybuilder ribbon 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 isolate something what we have to do 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.829
 It is the following 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.079
 we erase the head with the wig 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.969
 included although this is good with a 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.969
 first camera 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.190
 putting you in the head is worth 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.140
 I have once we already have this all 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.820
 we went to this and he also donated us 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.130
 the head with the good me in party 1 what 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.460
 next we have to do once 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.230
 that we already have all this done is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.750
 removing and cutting it into four pieces 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.470
 those four pieces how are they going to be 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.590
 we 're going to pass it to the rubber eva 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.410
 when when we have cut everything in 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.680
 four different pieces will remain that way with 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.810
 golden 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.440
 to avoid this ripple when the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.000
 bases to the material or rubber eva on 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.590
 all this goes a long way for eva rubber 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.870
 for being more flexible 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.940
 you have to make a clamp in the middle 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.940
 the clamp on a note thing that a cut 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.220
 simple here in the middle 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.170
 and it runs out of open and this has to be 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.190
 transfer it to the rubber eva and cut it with 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.190
 this same way 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.530
 to cut in the helmet 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.140
 what we have to do is go uniting 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.879
 each one with whom it corresponds to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.879
 form part of the helmet 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.810
 when we have joined the piece we are like that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.030
 we are adding the ornaments to the hat 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.879
 one of the characteristics that the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.310
 rubber eva stimulation of the surface is 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.980
 very porous and when you paint 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.519
 they have to absorb them besides apart from being 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.950
 very soft and very very malleable that's why it's 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.950
 good 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.200
 a good cheap way to put some 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.950
 buy primers and others is to take 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.800
 with the plant 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.440
 he is thrown by a white wave all over 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.310
 the surface until it is rigid is 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.340
 depends on the origin you want the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.440
 surface of the object itself cast him 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.750
 first one layer expected it to dry another 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.269
 layer we hope it looks dry and so 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.180
 continuously it is like this to do the 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.400
 horns with the help of a pattern we make 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.110
 a pattern on paper 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.180
 and we passed it to the cork 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.340
 what we have to do after 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.850
 find the mattress you can blow it with 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.350
 a scratch with a scraper or with a rubber band 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.710
 when we have the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.200
 the horns in all carving and all the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.640
 ornaments with night with much style of 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.310
 here coupled something 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.260
 to cardenas what we have to do what 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.420
 same as we did before is 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.280
 Apply able to strain until it is 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.680
 well rigid and so that this later to 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.080
 try it do not have any kind of powder 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.450
 They can take even the liquid 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.590
 vinyl emulsion or any kind of 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.590
 lean me alone
