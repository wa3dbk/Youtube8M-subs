00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
halo the halo goes around the driver's

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.350 
halo the halo goes around the driver's
compartment<00:00:07.049> around<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.950> roof<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:09.000> helps

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
compartment around the roof this helps

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.970 
compartment around the roof this helps
protect<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.870> drivers<00:00:10.200> head<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.860> also

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
protect the drivers head and are also

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.850 
protect the drivers head and are also
stiffens<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.940> chassis<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.200> triangulates

stiffens the chassis and triangulates

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.810 
stiffens the chassis and triangulates
down<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> frame<00:00:16.100> it's<00:00:17.100> basically<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
down to the frame it's basically just a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880 
down to the frame it's basically just a
hoop<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.080> doing<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.350> 90<00:00:19.619> degree

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
hoop so here we're doing a 90 degree

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.400 
hoop so here we're doing a 90 degree
Bend<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:21.060> gonna<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.570> past<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> driver's

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
Bend it's gonna go but past the driver's

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.650 
Bend it's gonna go but past the driver's
head<00:00:28.490> there<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.640> using<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.939> level<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.539> make

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
head there we're using a level to make

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.590 
head there we're using a level to make
sure<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.080> 90<00:00:31.410> degrees<00:00:32.270> I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
sure that we get 90 degrees I'm going to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540 
sure that we get 90 degrees I'm going to
do<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> slight<00:00:34.350> bend<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> end<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
do a slight bend at the end because the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
do a slight bend at the end because the
tubing<00:00:36.000> bender<00:00:36.270> didn't<00:00:36.540> quite<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> 90

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
tubing bender didn't quite go to 90

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
tubing bender didn't quite go to 90
degrees<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.370> laying<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
degrees so I'm going to be laying the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.690 
degrees so I'm going to be laying the
halo<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.690> top<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> roll<00:00:46.320> bar<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.039> then

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
halo on top of the roll bar and then

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.139 
halo on top of the roll bar and then
it's<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.149> big<00:00:48.510> gussets<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it's gonna have big gussets this is a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's gonna have big gussets this is a
little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.420> easier<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.079> type<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> race

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
little bit easier on this type of race

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
little bit easier on this type of race
car<00:00:52.910> because<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.090> hard<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.510> there

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
car because it's hard to get in there

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.340 
car because it's hard to get in there
and<00:00:54.719> weld<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> roof<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:56.899> if<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.079> had<00:00:58.170> chosen

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and weld with a roof on if we had chosen

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
and weld with a roof on if we had chosen
to<00:00:58.680> cut<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> roof<00:00:59.129> off<00:00:59.309> we<00:01:00.210> could<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> fish

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to cut the roof off we could do a fish

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.490 
to cut the roof off we could do a fish
mouth<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:02.039> fit<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> tube<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.500> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
mouth and then fit the tube right to the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.700 
mouth and then fit the tube right to the
roll<00:01:04.680> bar<00:01:04.880> right<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.150> using<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.479> level<00:01:06.810> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
roll bar right here I'm using a level so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
roll bar right here I'm using a level so
we<00:01:07.830> level<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> bottom<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> tube<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
we level the bottom of the tube then I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
we level the bottom of the tube then I
can<00:01:10.049> measure<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> marks<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
can measure up and make the marks of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330 
can measure up and make the marks of
where<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> cut<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> length<00:01:13.340> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
where I want to cut it to length and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
where I want to cut it to length and
you're<00:01:14.520> dragging<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.990> place<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.500> was

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you're dragging it in into place it was

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.990 
you're dragging it in into place it was
a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:16.950> difficult<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.820> roof

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
a little bit difficult because the roof

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.420 
a little bit difficult because the roof
curves<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.150> edges<00:01:21.950> nestled<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.070> right

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
curves so the two edges nestled in right

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.780 
curves so the two edges nestled in right
around<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.000> bends<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.080> roll<00:01:25.229> bar<00:01:25.790> right

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
around the bends of the roll bar right

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.660 
around the bends of the roll bar right
you'll<00:01:26.970> find<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:28.130> that's<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> big

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you'll find that that's where the big

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
you'll find that that's where the big
gussets<00:01:30.030> will<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.329> that'll<00:01:30.840> tie<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
gussets will be that'll tie it into the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.640 
gussets will be that'll tie it into the
roll<00:01:31.590> bar<00:01:32.119> there's<00:01:33.119> also<00:01:33.299> weld<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
roll bar there's also weld that that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.730 
roll bar there's also weld that that
holds<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.130> place<00:01:36.200> where<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.290> sitting<00:01:37.500> on

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
holds it in place where it's sitting on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.130 
holds it in place where it's sitting on
top<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> roll<00:01:38.400> bar<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:40.049> I'm

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
top of the roll bar you know I'm

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.910 
top of the roll bar you know I'm
starting<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> plan<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.820> window<00:01:42.090> bar<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
starting to plan the window bar the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.310 
starting to plan the window bar the
window<00:01:44.159> post

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.290 

so<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:48.620> gonna<00:01:48.860> lay<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.400> top<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.120> dash

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
so this is gonna lay on top of the dash

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.110 
so this is gonna lay on top of the dash
bar<00:01:50.600> it's<00:01:51.500> not<00:01:51.710> going<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.920> be<00:01:52.040> welded<00:01:52.580> directly

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
bar it's not going to be welded directly

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.520 
bar it's not going to be welded directly
into<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.780> we're<00:01:53.930> not<00:01:54.050> going<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.229> cut<00:01:54.380> this

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
into it so we're not going to cut this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.780 
into it so we're not going to cut this
pipe<00:01:54.740> we're<00:01:55.010> just<00:01:55.130> going<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.340> bend<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.700> and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
pipe we're just going to bend it and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.210 
pipe we're just going to bend it and
bring<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.000> down<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:57.110> way<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.320> can<00:01:57.530> stitch

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
bring it down that way you can stitch

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.840 
bring it down that way you can stitch
those<00:01:58.580> those<00:01:59.300> door<00:01:59.570> bars<00:01:59.840> together<00:02:00.050> and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
those those door bars together and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.270 
those those door bars together and
directly<00:02:01.850> tie<00:02:02.119> down<00:02:02.420> into<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.810> frame<00:02:06.190> it's<00:02:07.190> a

lot of fitting to do this because it's a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.050 
lot of fitting to do this because it's a
little<00:02:09.590> bit<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.920> complicated<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.640> angle

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
little bit of a complicated and angle

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.000 
little bit of a complicated and angle
you've<00:02:11.360> got<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.630> angle<00:02:11.930> at<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.080> top<00:02:12.260> I'm

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
you've got the angle at the top I'm

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.430 
you've got the angle at the top I'm
trying<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.370> keep<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:13.700> out<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:15.110> direct

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
trying to keep this out of the direct

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.150 
trying to keep this out of the direct
line<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.640> driver<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:18.500> I'm<00:02:18.590> mounting<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.070> a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
line of the driver so I'm mounting it a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.940 
line of the driver so I'm mounting it a
little<00:02:19.370> bit<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> side<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> have<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
little bit to the side so you have a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.470 
little bit to the side so you have a
choice<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.340> could<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:22.580> right<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
choice you could go right to the the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.720 
choice you could go right to the the
corner<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.110> bend<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.709> halo<00:02:25.130> that

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
corner of that bend on the halo that

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.790 
corner of that bend on the halo that
would<00:02:25.880> be<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.239> bit<00:02:26.540> into<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.410> drivers

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
would be a bit into the the drivers

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.330 
would be a bit into the the drivers
line-of-sight<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.800> whenever<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.100> use<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
line-of-sight so whenever I use the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.199

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.430 
plasma cutter to start my my fish mouth
and<00:02:38.209> we'd<00:02:38.330> make<00:02:38.480> sure<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.840> grind<00:02:39.050> out<00:02:39.230> all

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and we'd make sure that I grind out all

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.520 
and we'd make sure that I grind out all
of<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.100> slag<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.660> doesn't<00:02:41.930> contaminate<00:02:42.200> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
there on the dash bar I'm welding in

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.520 
there on the dash bar I'm welding in
there<00:03:48.510> stitch<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.690> together<00:03:49.840> that'll<00:03:50.380> get<00:03:50.500> a

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
there stitch that together that'll get a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.010 
there stitch that together that'll get a
gusset<00:03:50.950> also<00:03:51.459> now<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.330> stitched<00:03:52.540> into<00:03:52.900> this

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
gusset also now it's stitched into this

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.060 
gusset also now it's stitched into this
lower<00:03:54.030> door<00:03:55.030> bar<00:03:55.240> and<00:03:55.750> here<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.959> forgot<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.590> lock

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
lower door bar and here I forgot to lock

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.680 
lower door bar and here I forgot to lock
down<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> tripod<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.090> get<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.240> look<00:03:58.420> at<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
down the tripod so you get a look at the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.600 
down the tripod so you get a look at the
tarp<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.290> we<00:03:59.560> threw<00:03:59.800> over<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.130> car<00:04:00.340> for<00:04:00.580> a

tarp that we threw over the car for a
bit<00:04:01.709> there's<00:04:02.709> some<00:04:02.830> gussets<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.430> are<00:04:03.520> going

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
bit there's some gussets that are going

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:14.130 
bit there's some gussets that are going
in<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:10.709> little<00:04:11.709> vertical<00:04:12.400> brace<00:04:12.580> in<00:04:12.880> here<00:04:13.140> to

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
in a little vertical brace in here to

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.110 
in a little vertical brace in here to
tie<00:04:14.380> those<00:04:14.620> two<00:04:14.830> bars<00:04:15.010> together<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.640> transfer

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
tie those two bars together and transfer

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:33.950 
tie those two bars together and transfer
the<00:04:16.239> energy<00:04:16.650> down<00:04:17.650> into<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:33.430> we<00:04:33.490> bring<00:04:33.729> phrase

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
the energy down into and we bring phrase

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.560 
the energy down into and we bring phrase
braces<00:04:34.960> from<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.290> front<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:37.180> gonna<00:04:37.330> tie

we<00:05:08.830> still<00:05:09.039> have<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> bunch<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.580> bars<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.360> put<00:05:10.509> in

we still have a bunch of bars to put in
especially<00:05:11.259> around<00:05:11.379> the<00:05:11.680> driver's<00:05:12.009> head<00:05:12.039> and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
especially around the driver's head and

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.230 
especially around the driver's head and
behind<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:13.150> seat<00:05:13.750> so<00:05:14.650> don't<00:05:15.220> worry<00:05:15.400> there's<00:05:15.819> a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
behind the seat so don't worry there's a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.300 
behind the seat so don't worry there's a
lot<00:05:16.569> more<00:05:16.690> bracing<00:05:17.169> to<00:05:17.199> happen<00:05:17.919> around<00:05:18.039> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
lot more bracing to happen around the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.830 
lot more bracing to happen around the
halo<00:05:20.129> so<00:05:21.129> that's<00:05:21.250> about<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:24.569> keep<00:05:25.569> an<00:05:25.690> eye<00:05:25.750> out

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
halo so that's about it keep an eye out
