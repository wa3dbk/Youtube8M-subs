00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.839
 hello in this video we are going to make a 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.669
 boxing of this energy system order 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.580
 which is a tablet called in the 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.650
 issste no7 logically this exists 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.320
 inches and is pretty well priced 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.790
 because it costs 69 with 90 and has some 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.220
 keys a few characteristics 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.280
 first as low as ever 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.910
 we open here and open here 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.910
 and now yes 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.130
 and we have read if it contains the delivery note that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.710
 good face we will look at the putter not what 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.560
 we leave very far because we will use it 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.180
 like the delivery note and 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.240
 as he puts here and well here he does not put anything 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.520
 but if you are 69 with 90 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.920
 as we see we still have the bags 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.080
 of air that are the same bags of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.930
 our 5 that I also keep 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 out there saved because you can not 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.560
 come well for anything 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.570
 here 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.470
 I plan 7 we will set aside the box 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 packaging and let's look what it says 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.230
 It says it's an 8 gig tablet 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.230
 you wait a second 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.840
 with 8gb double camera to a gig of ram and 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.080
 android 4.4 that was what most called me 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.490
 the attention because I like quite that 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.439
 Android version 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.979
 we keep seeing good puts that 7 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.290
 inches double-core and name 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.950
 is here although it does not exist if it is 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.380
 seeing just a little bit but put in the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.909
 tablet no7 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.909
 more or less what I said before 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.780
 and well let's start to open this 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.820
 tablet now 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.640
 to open this you have to have a lot 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.060
 be careful because we are playing the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.180
 original box of the tablet so let's go 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 to do here goes the little cortecito and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.759
 then we remove everything with your hand if 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.700
 we got to make the cut 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.480
 when we already have that, you can already withdraw 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.010
 this plastic 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.010
 what is a part 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.700
 we move the plastic aside 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.340
 then you have to recycle and well we see that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.680
 in the box it is rare and it opens from a 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.680
 a bit special way you have to throw 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.140
 we have more the hollow box we are going to 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.930
 let her work 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 here for whom it seems that in things 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.520
 and we're going to a pretty little tablet 7 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.709
 inches and let's see what else there is 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.709
 under the tablet and that's worth 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.019
 we admire the tablet 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.700
 of security so that you do not take it or 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.700
 nothing if you see this here 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.620
 and the tablet is pretty good are 7 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.280
 inch a camera here another camera 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.549
 here to put ssd card and according to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.310
 presented here because they are like as before if 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:23.640
 is inches hd 8GB RAM dual core 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.930
 a android 4.4 a giga ram and dual core 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.569
 and it's good was pretty good 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.879
 It does not look good, we're going to 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.269
 remove the tablet we rotate this and the 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.269
 we put here 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.420
 once we put the mail we give here to 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:46.010
 the little arrow and it tells us that if we want 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.010
 we accept so let's accept 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.030
 and we are still waiting 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.180
 as always when you buy a 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.880
 phone well the first moments of 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.400
 turn on and all that costs a lot 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.440
 but then it's just pretty good now 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 you tell him 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.530
 backup copies so I want 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.530
 edit backup copies 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.490
 and then education and all that we leave 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.340
 as is and that you receive notifications and 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:23.470
 google play offers because it's a me 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.470
 like to buy things in body 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.270
 now that again and well my name is 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.270
 dani logically yes 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.680
 and my name is dan and I asked for a jab 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.620
 and the next 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.620
 establishing connection 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.600
 and good as we see the tablet is already 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.840
 turned on all the way as we see here it 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.500
 they are downloading updates as 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.130
 from gmail 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.130
 and data 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.310
 itself from gmail and from the application that 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.640
 that tells you about google now and 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.640
 those things 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.370
 and good when I finish updating and 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.390
 to put the entire tablet correctly 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.120
 we took a look though good 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.820
 and finally better let's go here and 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.490
 settings 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.910

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.500
 and let's see what it says 4.4 points and if 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.090

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.669
 chain cat 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.260
 and you android though fair but you do not see 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.260
