00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.019 

why<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> bunch<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.279> times<00:00:05.339> you'll<00:00:05.759> get<00:00:05.910> it

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
why that a bunch of times you'll get it

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.419 
why that a bunch of times you'll get it
so<00:00:06.660> then<00:00:06.810> our<00:00:06.930> plates<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.770> think<00:00:08.010> twice

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
so then our plates that I think twice

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.480 
so then our plates that I think twice
before<00:00:08.880> does<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.599> little<00:00:09.900> part<00:00:10.170> where<00:00:11.130> it's

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
before does this little part where it's

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.289 
before does this little part where it's
like<00:00:12.650> on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.099> B<00:00:14.280> string<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.700> will<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.940> seven

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
like on the B string it will be seven

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.000 
like on the B string it will be seven
and<00:00:15.890> then<00:00:16.890> ate<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.730> your<00:00:17.850> pinky<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.010> then

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
and then ate with your pinky and then

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.910 
and then ate with your pinky and then
death<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.539> high<00:00:21.570> E<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:23.279> big<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
death on the high E with you so big and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
death on the high E with you so big and
then<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.099> part<00:00:26.340> gets<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:27.029> tricky<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:27.660> me

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
then this part gets really tricky for me

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
then this part gets really tricky for me
just<00:00:28.260> making<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> switch<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.910> hand

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
just making the switch of your hand

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690 
just making the switch of your hand
position<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.830> five<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
position do it it's like it's five on

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.910 
position do it it's like it's five on
the<00:00:32.820> five<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.460> b5<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> G<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> then

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
the five on the b5 on the G and then

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.150 
the five on the b5 on the G and then
seven<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> D<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:41.750> twice<00:00:42.920> you'll<00:00:43.920> get

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
seven on the D so it's twice you'll get

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
seven on the D so it's twice you'll get
it<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.629> repeats<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.079> whole

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it there then it repeats that whole

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
it there then it repeats that whole
section<00:00:46.559> twice<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.879> goes<00:00:48.090> into<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
section twice but then it goes into the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.830 
section twice but then it goes into the
solo<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:49.980> solo<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> learned<00:00:51.629> by

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
solo and then solo I kind of learned by

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260 
solo and then solo I kind of learned by
area<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.829> tell<00:00:53.520> me<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:53.969> some

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
area so don't tell me if I got some

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.639 
area so don't tell me if I got some
parts<00:00:54.539> wrong<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:54.989> i'm<00:00:55.110> pretty<00:00:55.379> sure<00:00:55.620> i

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
parts wrong because i'm pretty sure i

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979 
parts wrong because i'm pretty sure i
think<00:00:55.980> i<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.219> parts<00:00:56.610> wrong<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:57.750> right

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
think i got some parts wrong all right

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
think i got some parts wrong all right
but<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:59.210> it<00:01:00.210> starts<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.520> 8th

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
but here it is it starts off on the 8th

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.060 
but here it is it starts off on the 8th
fret<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> hyena<00:01:03.600> goes<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
fret of the hyena goes and then to the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.990 
fret of the hyena goes and then to the
10th<00:01:08.900> back<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> eighth<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.729> want<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
10th back to the eighth then you want to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770 
10th back to the eighth then you want to
slide<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> third<00:01:13.850> then<00:01:14.850> open

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
slide down to the third then open

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.760 
slide down to the third then open
then<00:01:17.290> fits<00:01:17.680> for<00:01:17.890> iming<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.250> first<00:01:18.460> right<00:01:18.670> then

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
then fits for iming the first right then

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.719 
then fits for iming the first right then
up<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.100> B<00:01:21.790> string<00:01:22.150> first<00:01:22.540> fret<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:23.170> then

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
up to the B string first fret and then

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.510 
up to the B string first fret and then
up<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.880> fifth<00:01:25.180> fret<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.890> beat<00:01:27.190> so

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
up to the fifth fret of the beat so

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.680 
up to the fifth fret of the beat so
altogether<00:01:27.850> it's<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.820> again<00:01:37.300> it<00:01:37.479> kind

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
altogether it's and then again it kind

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.830 
altogether it's and then again it kind
of<00:01:37.780> starts<00:01:38.110> off<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.229> same<00:01:38.380> way<00:01:38.590> going<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
of starts off the same way going but

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.800 
of starts off the same way going but
this<00:01:44.020> time<00:01:44.200> it's<00:01:44.409> back<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.860> first<00:01:45.100> Fred

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this time it's back to the first Fred

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950 
this time it's back to the first Fred
three<00:01:46.810> times<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.500> then<00:01:48.220> three<00:01:48.580> five<00:01:49.030> four

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
three times and then three five four

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.330 
three times and then three five four
three<00:01:49.990> times<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:50.979> fourth<00:01:51.280> fret<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.700> then

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
three times on the fourth fret and then

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:09.130 
three times on the fourth fret and then
57<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.119> it's

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.140 

and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.190> reach<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:11.910> weird

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and then we reach this really weird

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.850 
and then we reach this really weird
complicated<00:02:12.959> part<00:02:13.140> I'm<00:02:13.260> still<00:02:13.470> trying<00:02:13.740> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
complicated part I'm still trying to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.199 
complicated part I'm still trying to
learn<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.760> aight<00:02:15.569> me10<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.220> b<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> then

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
learn it's aight me10 on the b and then

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.940 
learn it's aight me10 on the b and then
1210<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.840> high<00:02:21.990> E<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:24.530> been<00:02:25.530> twelve

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
1210 on the high E so it's been twelve

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.699 
1210 on the high E so it's been twelve
eight<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.390> 10<00:02:28.459> 10-12<00:02:29.459> 1012<00:02:30.420> paid<00:02:33.709> then

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
eight so it's 10 10-12 1012 paid then

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:45.620 
eight so it's 10 10-12 1012 paid then
it's<00:02:34.920> 12<00:02:35.489> 10<00:02:35.819> 8<00:02:36.530> 17<00:02:37.730> 15<00:02:39.320> 13<00:02:40.970> 8<00:02:42.170> 12<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:44.180> 13<00:02:45.180> 10

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
it's 12 10 8 17 15 13 8 12 and 13 10

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.930 
it's 12 10 8 17 15 13 8 12 and 13 10
that's<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> think<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.760> really

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
that's what I think it is I'm not really

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.280 
that's what I think it is I'm not really
sure<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.450> all<00:02:48.570> together<00:02:48.870> she<00:02:49.080> sound<00:02:49.260> like

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
sure but all together she sound like

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.370 
sure but all together she sound like
this<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.100> right<00:02:56.989> then<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.319> of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
this if you get it right then it kind of

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.930 
this if you get it right then it kind of
repeats<00:02:58.709> itself<00:02:58.890> over<00:02:59.190> again<00:02:59.580> going

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.820 

but<00:03:04.940> this<00:03:05.270> time<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.720> go<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.190> 10<00:03:07.190> 12<00:03:07.490> 10<00:03:08.830> it's

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
but this time you go to 10 12 10 it's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.920 
but this time you go to 10 12 10 it's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.490 

but<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.849> is<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.090> basically<00:04:09.870> strumming<00:04:10.380> all

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
but that is just basically strumming all

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.949 
but that is just basically strumming all
the<00:04:10.620> strings<00:04:10.920> down<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.430> coming<00:04:11.610> back<00:04:11.849> up<00:04:12.150> then

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
the strings down and coming back up then

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.759 
the strings down and coming back up then
you<00:04:13.140> go<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:14.000> c.c<00:04:15.000> Fred<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:16.139> if<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.590> don't

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
you go to a c.c Fred and if you don't

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.530 
you go to a c.c Fred and if you don't
know<00:04:16.859> what<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.669> lifting<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.299> ring

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
know what that is just lifting your ring

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.220 
know what that is just lifting your ring
finger<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.470> 3rd<00:04:19.829> fret<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.970> string

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
finger to the 3rd fret of the a string

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.040 
finger to the 3rd fret of the a string
so<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:26.220> then<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.090> next<00:04:27.120> part<00:04:27.540> is<00:04:27.750> really

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
so and then the next part is really

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.320 
so and then the next part is really
complicated<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.760> take<00:04:30.000> your<00:04:30.150> first

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
complicated it's you take your first

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.370 
complicated it's you take your first
finger<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.130> bar<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.790> whole<00:04:32.930> 1st<00:04:33.930> fret

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
finger and you bar the whole 1st fret

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.140 
finger and you bar the whole 1st fret
and<00:04:34.560> then<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:35.160> take<00:04:35.400> your<00:04:35.430> ring<00:04:35.730> finger<00:04:35.970> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
and then you take your ring finger and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.810 
and then you take your ring finger and
go<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.600> third<00:04:36.870> on<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.460> pinky<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.580> third

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
go to the third on the a pinky to third

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.740 
go to the third on the a pinky to third
on<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> D<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.600> your<00:04:39.900> middle<00:04:40.710> finger<00:04:41.450> second<00:04:42.450> on

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
the G so it should be and then I don't

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.219 
the G so it should be and then I don't
know<00:04:49.139> what<00:04:49.229> this<00:04:49.500> Court<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.070> called<00:04:50.370> but<00:04:50.669> it's

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
and then you know first on the G with

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.430 
and then you know first on the G with
your<00:05:02.130> first<00:05:02.310> finger<00:05:02.690> then<00:05:03.690> your<00:05:03.810> pinky<00:05:04.229> goes

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
your first finger then your pinky goes

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.140 
your first finger then your pinky goes
on<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.710> 3rd<00:05:04.950> fret<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> B<00:05:05.490> string<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:06.090> it

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
on the 3rd fret of the B string so it

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.470 
on the 3rd fret of the B string so it
should<00:05:06.330> be

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.890 

and<00:05:09.720> then<00:05:10.170> all<00:05:10.590> together<00:05:10.890> on<00:05:11.660> acoustic<00:05:12.660> it

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
and then all together on acoustic it

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:22.090 
and then all together on acoustic it
should<00:05:13.080> sound<00:05:13.230> like<00:05:13.320> this

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.370 

if<00:05:22.550> you're<00:05:22.790> playing<00:05:22.970> electric<00:05:23.570> I<00:05:23.780> imagine

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
if you're playing electric I imagine

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:33.950 
if you're playing electric I imagine
probably<00:05:24.560> would<00:05:24.800> sound<00:05:25.010> something<00:05:25.220> like<00:05:25.400> this

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.970 

that's<00:05:34.960> all<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.170> really<00:05:35.470> know<00:05:35.620> at<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:35.890> point

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
that's all I really know at this point

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.670 
that's all I really know at this point
