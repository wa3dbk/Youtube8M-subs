where<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> would<00:03:39.269> normally<00:03:39.389> if<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.870> was<00:03:39.989> drawing

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
where I would normally if I was drawing

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.750 
where I would normally if I was drawing
a<00:03:40.199> realistic<00:03:40.709> picture<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.159> eyeline<00:03:41.489> would<00:03:41.639> be

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
a realistic picture the eyeline would be

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.670 
a realistic picture the eyeline would be
kind<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.060> if<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.810> measure<00:03:43.139> from<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.379> top<00:03:43.530> to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
kind of if you measure from the top to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.689 
kind of if you measure from the top to
the<00:03:43.769> bottom<00:03:43.799> would<00:03:44.129> be<00:03:44.220> right<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.579> middle

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
the bottom would be right in the middle

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.369 
the bottom would be right in the middle
I'm<00:03:44.879> gonna<00:03:45.030> bring<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.479> down<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.780> little<00:03:46.019> bit<00:03:46.199> so

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
I'm gonna bring it down a little bit so

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.140 
I'm gonna bring it down a little bit so
as<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.709> land<00:03:46.949> is<00:03:47.010> gonna<00:03:47.159> be<00:03:47.280> right<00:03:47.430> about<00:03:47.639> there

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
as I land is gonna be right about there

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.259 
as I land is gonna be right about there

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
when I have it come up just a little bit

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.210 
when I have it come up just a little bit
so<00:03:58.199> it<00:03:58.260> looks<00:03:58.379> like<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:58.620> coming<00:03:58.769> up<00:03:58.919> Reverse

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
