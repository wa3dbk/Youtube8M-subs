automatically<00:05:31.650> we<00:05:31.860> create<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.190> folder<00:05:32.610> here

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
automatically we create a folder here

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.999 
automatically we create a folder here
called<00:05:32.820> modes<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.509> now<00:05:34.320> what<00:05:34.500> we<00:05:34.590> could<00:05:34.740> do<00:05:34.830> is

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
called modes and now what we could do is

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.290 
called modes and now what we could do is
just<00:05:35.039> go<00:05:35.400> back<00:05:35.580> to<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.820> Downloads<00:05:36.210> folder

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
just go back to the Downloads folder

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.540 
just go back to the Downloads folder
which<00:05:36.720> we<00:05:36.960> downloaded<00:05:37.410> all<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.590> files<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:38.190> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
which we downloaded all the files to and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.730 
which we downloaded all the files to and
then<00:05:39.300> just<00:05:39.330> minimize<00:05:39.840> both<00:05:40.080> of<00:05:40.289> these<00:05:40.410> and

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
then just minimize both of these and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.350 
then just minimize both of these and
then<00:05:40.949> what<00:05:41.130> you<00:05:41.190> have<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.370> do<00:05:41.580> is<00:05:41.789> just<00:05:42.060> come

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
then what you have to do is just come

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.040 
then what you have to do is just come

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
here and select all of these red power

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.990 
here and select all of these red power
files<00:05:46.050> which<00:05:46.259> we<00:05:46.440> just<00:05:46.650> downloaded<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.400> then

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
files which we just downloaded and then

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.420 
files which we just downloaded and then
just<00:05:48.210> drag<00:05:48.510> them<00:05:48.750> into<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.350> modes<00:05:49.560> file<00:05:50.100> and

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
just drag them into the modes file and

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.629 
just drag them into the modes file and
we<00:05:51.330> should<00:05:51.479> have<00:05:51.660> them<00:05:51.780> all<00:05:51.870> here<00:05:52.139> okay<00:05:53.070> this

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
ton of different redstone repeaters or

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.670 
ton of different redstone repeaters or
things<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.370> I<00:06:51.910> mean<00:06:52.750> look<00:06:52.840> at<00:06:52.960> this<00:06:53.110> the<00:06:53.290> xor

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
things and I mean look at this the xor

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.840 
things and I mean look at this the xor
do<00:06:53.770> you<00:06:53.860> know<00:06:53.950> how<00:06:54.040> hard<00:06:54.220> actually<00:06:54.400> to<00:06:54.550> make<00:06:54.700> it

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
do you know how hard actually to make it

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.090 
do you know how hard actually to make it
now<00:06:55.000> he<00:06:55.060> had<00:06:55.330> it<00:06:55.450> ready<00:06:55.630> in<00:06:55.750> one<00:06:56.370> single

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
now he had it ready in one single

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.010 
now he had it ready in one single
repeater<00:07:00.100> let<00:07:00.310> me<00:07:00.370> just<00:07:00.550> place<00:07:00.730> it<00:07:00.760> down<00:07:01.020> and

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
repeater let me just place it down and

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.600 
repeater let me just place it down and
look<00:07:02.200> at<00:07:02.410> it<00:07:02.470> facing<00:07:03.010> this<00:07:03.100> is<00:07:03.250> the<00:07:03.340> actual

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
look at it facing this is the actual

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.330 
look at it facing this is the actual
axle<00:07:04.060> which<00:07:04.180> it<00:07:04.300> takes<00:07:04.480> about<00:07:04.889> so<00:07:05.889> long<00:07:06.160> to

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
axle which it takes about so long to

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.040 
axle which it takes about so long to
build<00:07:06.700> probably<00:07:07.180> about<00:07:07.300> a<00:07:07.360> minute<00:07:07.570> to<00:07:07.780> kind<00:07:07.960> of

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
build probably about a minute to kind of

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.330 
build probably about a minute to kind of
build<00:07:08.290> and<00:07:08.440> you<00:07:08.560> can<00:07:08.680> just<00:07:08.860> have<00:07:08.980> it<00:07:09.010> in<00:07:09.160> one

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
build and you can just have it in one

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.370 
build and you can just have it in one
repeater<00:07:09.669> and<00:07:09.940> you<00:07:10.690> look<00:07:10.900> at<00:07:10.990> this<00:07:11.139> you've<00:07:11.290> got

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
repeater and you look at this you've got

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.140 
repeater and you look at this you've got
a<00:07:11.410> ton<00:07:11.919> of<00:07:11.950> different<00:07:12.280> coloring<00:07:12.940> and
