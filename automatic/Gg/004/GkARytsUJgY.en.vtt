of people I was training that I would
show<00:00:20.820> them<00:00:21.000> how<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.439> create<00:00:22.439> an<00:00:22.529> animation

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
show them how to create an animation

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.700 
show them how to create an animation
within<00:00:23.340> an<00:00:23.550> animation<00:00:24.240> well<00:00:24.840> here's<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.109> bit<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
within an animation well here's a bit of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.970 
within an animation well here's a bit of
a<00:00:25.830> preview<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.980> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
get a bit of an idea and let's go back

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.220 
get a bit of an idea and let's go back
to<00:00:32.040> animate<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.750> gonna<00:00:33.870> create

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to animate and I'm just I'm gonna create

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.819 
to animate and I'm just I'm gonna create
a<00:00:34.290> new<00:00:35.510> project<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.840> we'll<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.500> say<00:00:37.800> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
a new project here we'll just say that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
a new project here we'll just say that
and<00:00:38.340> I'll<00:00:38.460> say<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.940> straight<00:00:39.210> over<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> top

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and I'll say that straight over the top

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
and I'll say that straight over the top
of<00:00:43.160> something<00:00:44.160> I've<00:00:44.399> already<00:00:44.670> done<00:00:47.120> mainly

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
of something I've already done mainly

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.779 
of something I've already done mainly
because<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> car<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:55.789> wheel

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
because I have the car and a wheel

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.349 
because I have the car and a wheel
graphic<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.600> now<00:00:57.809> already<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.680> use

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
graphic in now already that I can use

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.510 
graphic in now already that I can use
just<00:01:00.359> click<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> stage<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:02.100> make

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
just click on the stage and just make

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910 
just click on the stage and just make
that<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.730> little<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.379> wider<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that a little bit wider so that we

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
that a little bit wider so that we
eventually<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.549> some<00:01:05.580> room<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
eventually have some room for the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
eventually have some room for the
animation<00:01:07.380> first<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
animation first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
animation first thing I'm going to do is
I<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.810> two<00:01:10.140> wheels<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.799> are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I want to get two wheels that are

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340 
I want to get two wheels that are
turning<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> turn<00:01:13.049> this

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
turning so I'm going to turn this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.390 
turning so I'm going to turn this
particular<00:01:13.860> graphic<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.590> symbol<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
particular graphic into a symbol and I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.539 
particular graphic into a symbol and I
can<00:01:17.610> animate<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> symbol<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> click<00:01:20.100> select

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
can animate that symbol so click select

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
can animate that symbol so click select
the<00:01:20.640> artwork<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.150> we'll<00:01:21.270> click<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the artwork and we'll click here on the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.240 
the artwork and we'll click here on the
symbol<00:01:23.939> icon<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.869> we'll<00:01:25.439> convert<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.100> we've

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
symbol icon and we'll convert what we've

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
symbol icon and we'll convert what we've
got<00:01:26.430> selected<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> symbol<00:01:32.840> there<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
got selected into a symbol there it is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
got selected into a symbol there it is
our<00:01:34.259> position<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.280> bit<00:01:35.490> better

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
our position it a little bit better

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.050 
our position it a little bit better
because<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:36.720> clunky<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
because it's a little bit clunky and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.130 
because it's a little bit clunky and
obviously<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> auto

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
obviously because I have the auto

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
obviously because I have the auto
keyframe<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.920> order<00:01:41.070> transition<00:01:41.579> options

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
keyframe and order transition options

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
keyframe and order transition options
enabled<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.350> providing<00:01:44.220> some

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
enabled it's providing some

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.730 
enabled it's providing some
complimentary<00:01:45.030> keyframes<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.079> really

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
complimentary keyframes that I really

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800 
complimentary keyframes that I really
don't<00:01:46.950> need<00:01:47.100> at<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.460> stage<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> do

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
don't need at this stage but what I do

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.590 
don't need at this stage but what I do
want<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.649> make<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.759> will

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
want to do is make sure that this will

want to do is make sure that this will
is<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.860> turning<00:01:53.840> now<00:01:55.399> in<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.420> my

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
is going to be turning now in my on my

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.190 
is going to be turning now in my on my
stage<00:01:58.049> here<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.909> confuse<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:00.990> the

stage here to not confuse this with the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
stage here to not confuse this with the
actual<00:02:01.710> symbol<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> call

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
actual symbol I'm just going to call

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.870 
actual symbol I'm just going to call
this<00:02:03.119> back<00:02:04.189> wheel<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
this back wheel because that's what it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.710 
this back wheel because that's what it
is<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.590> edit<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.340> symbol<00:02:08.789> by<00:02:09.090> double

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
is and I can edit the symbol by double

plant to the first second and as you
noticed<00:02:26.010> I've<00:02:26.250> enabled<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.270> pin<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.780> don't

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
noticed I've enabled the pin so don't

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.020 
noticed I've enabled the pin so don't
have<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.170> worry<00:02:28.530> worry<00:02:28.860> about<00:02:29.250> setting<00:02:29.790> cap

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
start and end two keyframes and I also

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270 
start and end two keyframes and I also
don't<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.480> work<00:02:33.690> worry<00:02:34.140> about<00:02:34.530> building

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
don't have to work worry about building

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.340 
don't have to work worry about building
a<00:02:35.640> transition<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.570> animate<00:02:36.990> will<00:02:37.140> do

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
a transition and animate will do

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.960 
a transition and animate will do
everything<00:02:37.680> for<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.840> let's<00:02:39.840> change<00:02:40.970> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
everything for you let's change the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.040 
everything for you let's change the
rotation<00:02:42.210> through<00:02:42.780> 360<00:02:43.350> degrees<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:45.050> that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
rotation through 360 degrees and that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.660 
rotation through 360 degrees and that
will<00:02:46.200> now<00:02:46.380> be<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:47.060> spinning<00:02:48.060> symbol<00:02:49.370> say<00:02:50.370> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
will now be a spinning symbol say that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.000 
will now be a spinning symbol say that
I'll<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.210> jump<00:02:51.510> back<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.500> preview<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:52.950> in

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
I'll just jump back so preview this in

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.440 
I'll just jump back so preview this in
the<00:02:53.130> browser<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.330> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
the browser and we now see that that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.240 
the browser and we now see that that
only<00:02:54.570> spins<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.410> one<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:55.920> need<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> do

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
only spins a one so we need to do

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.310 
only spins a one so we need to do
another<00:02:56.700> thing<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.270> actually<00:02:57.450> get

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
another thing and that's actually get

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.580 
another thing and that's actually get
this<00:02:59.360> turning<00:03:00.360> continuously<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.320> I'm<00:03:01.380> going

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
this turning continuously so I'm going

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.180 
this turning continuously so I'm going
to<00:03:01.710> edit<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.610> symbol<00:03:03.210> again<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.980> case

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
to edit that symbol again and this case

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.850 
to edit that symbol again and this case
I'm<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.520> do<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.350> basically<00:03:07.350> move<00:03:07.740> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
I'm going to do is basically move the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.920 
I'm going to do is basically move the
planet<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:08.640> one<00:03:08.790> second<00:03:09.240> what<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.750> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
planet to that one second what I want to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.320 
planet to that one second what I want to
happen<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:11.250> playhead<00:03:11.700> moves<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.210> this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
happen is that playhead moves to this

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.050 
happen is that playhead moves to this
particular<00:03:13.320> point<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.770> needs<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.130> go<00:03:14.370> back<00:03:14.670> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
particular point it needs to go back to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.430 
particular point it needs to go back to
zero<00:03:15.450> second<00:03:15.990> now<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.170> do<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.500> by<00:03:16.710> including

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
zero second now you do that by including

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.350 
zero second now you do that by including
trigger<00:03:19.440> click<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.250> little<00:03:20.460> insert<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.210> your

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
trigger click the little insert to your

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.570 
trigger click the little insert to your
icon<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.560> gonna<00:03:22.740> do<00:03:22.920> here<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.310> tell

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
icon and all I'm gonna do here is tell

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.690 
icon and all I'm gonna do here is tell
it<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.940> play<00:03:25.040> from<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.900> 0-0<00:03:27.900> with

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
it to play from the 0-0 with

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.580 
it to play from the 0-0 with
milliseconds<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.990> animation<00:03:31.470> which

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
milliseconds in the animation which

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.960 
milliseconds in the animation which
basically<00:03:31.950> pushes<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> playhead<00:03:32.790> through

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
basically pushes the playhead through

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.580 
basically pushes the playhead through
the<00:03:33.060> start<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.020> will<00:03:34.110> start<00:03:34.350> playing

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the start and it will start playing

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.990 
the start and it will start playing
again<00:03:35.720> I'll<00:03:36.720> say<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.350> will<00:03:37.800> jump<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.100> into

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
again I'll say this will jump back into

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.820 
again I'll say this will jump back into
the<00:03:39.120> animation<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:39.600> see<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.140> now<00:03:40.290> have<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.500> car

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
the animation just see we now have a car

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.910 
the animation just see we now have a car
with<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> continuously<00:03:41.990> spinning<00:03:42.990> wheels<00:03:43.500> all

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
with a continuously spinning wheels all

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640 
with a continuously spinning wheels all
I<00:03:44.040> need<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.280> do<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.990> create<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.080> copy<00:03:46.440> of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
I need to do now is create a copy of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.390 
I need to do now is create a copy of
that<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:47.130> we've<00:03:48.000> got<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.450> second<00:03:48.990> wheel<00:03:49.680> here

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
that and we've got the second wheel here

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.640 
that and we've got the second wheel here
I<00:03:50.700> think<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.660> might<00:03:51.780> have<00:03:51.870> created<00:03:52.080> cue<00:03:52.500> too

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
I think I might have created cue too

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.060 
I think I might have created cue too
many<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.880> look<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:54.660> you've<00:03:54.840> got<00:03:55.140> ok

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
many this is a look when you've got ok

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.430 
many this is a look when you've got ok
we'll<00:03:56.220> delete<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:56.670> one<00:03:57.080> well<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.230> can<00:03:58.350> have

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
we'll delete that one well you can have

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.900 
we'll delete that one well you can have
a<00:03:58.470> car<00:03:58.710> with<00:03:58.830> three<00:03:58.950> wheels<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.520> want<00:03:59.730> to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
a car with three wheels if you want to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.370 
a car with three wheels if you want to
and<00:04:00.570> I'll<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.110> rename<00:04:01.710> this<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.990> once<00:04:06.990> again

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
and I'll just rename this and once again

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.400 
and I'll just rename this and once again
I've<00:04:07.650> got<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:08.810> keyframe<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:10.020> there<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.380> I

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
I've got a keyframe in there that I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.470 
I've got a keyframe in there that I
didn't<00:04:11.070> want<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.910> next<00:04:12.150> thing<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.360> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
didn't want so the next thing that I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.120 
didn't want so the next thing that I
want<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.660> do<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.960> actually<00:04:13.170> take<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.890> car

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
want to do is actually take the car

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.660 
want to do is actually take the car
including<00:04:14.820> your<00:04:14.850> two<00:04:15.120> wheels<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:16.400> move<00:04:17.400> that

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
including your two wheels and move that

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.370 
including your two wheels and move that
across<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.150> stage<00:04:18.420> so<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.049> another

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
across the stage so there is another

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.170 
across the stage so there is another
simple<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> need<00:04:20.460> to<00:04:20.609> create<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> is

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
simple that I need to create and that is

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.409 
simple that I need to create and that is
a<00:04:21.210> symbol<00:04:21.540> of<00:04:21.840> all<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.860> these<00:04:23.490> components<00:04:24.330> that

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
a symbol of all of these components that

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.510 
a symbol of all of these components that
are<00:04:24.540> two<00:04:24.690> moving<00:04:25.110> wheels<00:04:25.290> rotating<00:04:26.220> wheels

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
are two moving wheels rotating wheels

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.000 
are two moving wheels rotating wheels
and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.740 
and
the<00:04:27.100> cap<00:04:27.340> we're<00:04:27.910> now<00:04:28.090> going<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.360> turn<00:04:28.510> that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
the cap we're now going to turn that

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.230 
the cap we're now going to turn that
into<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.680> complete<00:04:30.160> package<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.880> convert

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
into the complete package and convert

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.960 
into the complete package and convert
this<00:04:31.540> particular<00:04:31.690> selection<00:04:32.320> into<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.520> car

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
this particular selection into the car

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.010 
this particular selection into the car
is<00:04:36.030> yours<00:04:37.030> or<00:04:37.210> tires<00:04:37.680> noise<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:40.270> last<00:04:40.840> thing

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
is yours or tires noise so last thing

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.110 
is yours or tires noise so last thing
last<00:04:41.950> thing<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.280> do<00:04:42.430> is<00:04:42.460> we<00:04:42.670> now<00:04:42.790> need<00:04:43.000> to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
last thing to do is we now need to

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.100 
last thing to do is we now need to
animate<00:04:43.480> this<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.940> play<00:04:46.210> exoplanets

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
animate this so to play exoplanets

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.440 
animate this so to play exoplanets
really<00:04:47.380> at<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.530> start<00:04:48.060> I'm<00:04:49.060> just<00:04:49.270> going<00:04:49.420> to

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
really at the start I'm just going to

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.230 
really at the start I'm just going to
bring<00:04:49.690> this<00:04:49.870> down<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.230> bit<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.770> can<00:04:50.890> see<00:04:51.460> up<00:04:52.030> to

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
bring this down a bit so I can see up to

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.280 
bring this down a bit so I can see up to
you<00:04:52.300> about<00:04:52.360> seven<00:04:52.870> seconds<00:04:54.930> that's<00:04:55.930> okay<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
you about seven seconds that's okay I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.840 
you about seven seconds that's okay I
can<00:04:56.410> stay<00:04:56.830> there<00:04:57.040> because<00:04:57.400> we<00:04:57.550> need<00:04:57.700> this

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
can stay there because we need this

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.150 
can stay there because we need this
anyway<00:05:00.060> top<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.240> pin<00:05:01.450> on<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.800> let's

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
anyway top of the pin on and let's

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.850 
anyway top of the pin on and let's
animate<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.790> over<00:05:04.330> about<00:05:04.720> seven<00:05:05.200> seconds

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
animate this over about seven seconds

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.990 
animate this over about seven seconds
and<00:05:06.130> get<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.640> car<00:05:06.910> moving<00:05:07.540> off<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.770> edge<00:05:09.700> of

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
and get that car moving off the edge of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.570 
and get that car moving off the edge of
the<00:05:10.090> stage<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:11.070> preview<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.190> see<00:05:12.430> what

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
the stage and preview and see what

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.410 
the stage and preview and see what
actually<00:05:12.670> works<00:05:14.310> that's<00:05:15.310> looking<00:05:15.640> good<00:05:15.760> so

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
actually works that's looking good so

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.300 
actually works that's looking good so
that's<00:05:16.540> how<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:16.810> create<00:05:17.110> an<00:05:17.560> animation

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
that's how you create an animation

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.570 
that's how you create an animation
within<00:05:18.730> an<00:05:18.910> animation<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:20.160> turn<00:05:21.160> that<00:05:21.370> into

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
within an animation and turn that into

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.700 
within an animation and turn that into
an<00:05:21.880> animation<00:05:22.210> within<00:05:22.570> an<00:05:22.780> animation<00:05:23.140> so<00:05:23.530> this

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
an animation within an animation so this

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.030 
an animation within an animation so this
is<00:05:23.890> like<00:05:24.070> two<00:05:24.580> animations<00:05:25.000> within<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:26.040> symbol

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
is like two animations within a symbol

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.200 
is like two animations within a symbol
that<00:05:27.280> I<00:05:28.000> in<00:05:28.420> turn<00:05:28.860> becoming<00:05:29.860> an<00:05:30.100> animation<00:05:30.520> try

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
that I in turn becoming an animation try

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.610 
that I in turn becoming an animation try
it<00:05:31.270> out<00:05:31.450> with<00:05:31.630> one<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.900> your<00:05:31.990> projects<00:05:32.470> I'm

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
it out with one of your projects I'm

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.290 
it out with one of your projects I'm
sure<00:05:32.800> you've<00:05:32.950> got<00:05:33.160> other<00:05:33.520> examples<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.150> you

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
sure you've got other examples that you

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.390 
sure you've got other examples that you
can<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:34.960> can<00:05:35.170> use<00:05:35.320> this<00:05:35.470> for<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.950> feel

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
can that you can use this for and feel
