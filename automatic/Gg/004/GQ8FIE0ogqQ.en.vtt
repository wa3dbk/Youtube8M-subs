 Hi, I'm Nestor Serra Coach 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.369
 staff and creator of method 3 per day 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.259
 continuing with the previous program we are going 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.410
 to work the training for 30 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.330
 min we will focus on mobility and 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.939
 joint stability but the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.010
 we will move to the author terrain as well 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.750
 than in the previous Christian program 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.510
 accompanies us to help us demonstrate 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.870
 the exercises let's start with the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.210
 particular mobility work 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.479
 we will divide the body into four parts 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.680
 the part of the head including the 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.330
 neck the trunk part the hip and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.979
 then at the end all the lower train with 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.170
 The three main joints 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.440
 we started with a rotation job is 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.860
 simpler in which we will take the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.500
 shoulder to shoulder and we will start to perform 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.630
 circular movements giving maximum 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 mobility to each of the vertebrae 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.990
 cervical 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.160
 a second job in position 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.830
 horizontal the head does not move and in 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.400
 this plane we will take the head towards 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.370
 front to back and then 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.310
 we will make circles to one side and another 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.680
 changing direction without moving the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:40.630
 shoulders and in which only the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:42.670
 head for the second exercise we 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.700
 we place in the same position we carry 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.560
 the chest forward and backward and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.460
 from here we start to make circles 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 to one side and to the other without moving 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.320
 neither the shoulders nor the hip 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.680
 for the third zone 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.649
 we will also make movements 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.509
 circular in our hip looking for the 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.340
 maximum range of motion equal to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.590
 before we always look for maximum amplitude 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.000
 of movement making circles towards 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.280
 one side and the other 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.590
 this will be the first exercise and the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.520
 second exercise we will do the same 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.720
 but drawing some eights with our 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.090
 hip giving maximum mobility 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.150
 finally focusing on the whole kingdom 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.130
 inside we can stand on a tree 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.100
 or on a rock or a companion 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.500
 in this way we will raise the knee and 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.020
 with the heel we will begin to draw eights 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.720
 in a horizontal plane we can 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.060
 work it in one direction and in the other 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.450
 sense 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.050
 giving a lot of mobility just like before 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.050
 in the hip joint and the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.940
 ankle one of the ways to work 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.970
 stability and improve in our 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.569
 descents is to perform the training 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.300
 after the race session with her 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.580
 we will minimize the injuries on our 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.830
 structure the work exercise 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.260
 eccentric muscle we'll start it 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.360
 performing on one foot raising the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 another knee and from this position 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.680
 separating the arms well and using 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.080
 the entire structure to cushion this 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.230
 fall we will make jumps aside and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.450
 another on a little steep descent and 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.280
 controlling at all times our 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.860
 center of gravity for this second 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.069
 exercise we will look for a more surface 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.200
 stable in which we will place ourselves on 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.540
 one foot and we will elaborate one of the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.660
 two knees the arms next to the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.210
 body and we will make a sharp descent 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.490
 from our center of gravity 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.710
 looking for the four cardinal points 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.660
 with our north foot south east and west 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.319
 cushioning work with the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.269
 movement of our arms 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.060
 to increase the difficulty of 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.299
 exercise we can look for surfaces 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.549
 irregularities in which to compromise the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.380
 balance and the instability of 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.140
 our joints 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.790
 The importance of this work is that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.670
 will help us control the oscillations 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.010
 of our center of gravity and this 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.400
 way to save energy 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:29.020
 prevent muscle injuries and decrease 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.020
 fatigue and muscle fatigue
