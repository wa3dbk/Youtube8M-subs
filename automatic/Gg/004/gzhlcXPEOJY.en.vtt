00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
another one in there here we go so again

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.770 
another one in there here we go so again

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
that smoke but you don't really hear

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:39.880 
that smoke but you don't really hear
much<00:03:25.780> do<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.880> was<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> pop<00:03:28.709> pop<00:03:35.310> okay

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.770 

so<00:03:40.850> there<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> go<00:03:41.240> what<00:03:41.420> do<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.510> think<00:03:41.690> about

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
so there you go what do you think about

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.350 
so there you go what do you think about
that<00:03:42.140> one<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.400> sounds<00:03:43.820> I'm<00:03:43.940> not<00:03:44.090> happy

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
that one and the sounds I'm not happy

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.490 
that one and the sounds I'm not happy
with<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.600> sound<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:44.960> it<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.200> I'm<00:03:45.350> going<00:03:45.470> to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
with the sound on it so I'm going to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.290 
with the sound on it so I'm going to
blame<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.800> on<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.010> caps<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.700> not<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.090> gun

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
blame it on the caps and not the gun

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.210 
blame it on the caps and not the gun
because<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.630> gun<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.840> well-made<00:03:48.440> I'm

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
because the gun is well-made I'm

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.130 
because the gun is well-made I'm
thinking<00:03:49.580> either<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:49.790> got<00:03:49.970> some<00:03:50.180> bum<00:03:50.390> caps<00:03:50.720> or

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
thinking either I got some bum caps or

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.140 
thinking either I got some bum caps or
maybe<00:03:51.920> there's<00:03:52.160> caps<00:03:52.430> out<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.030> are

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
maybe there's caps out there that are

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.820 
maybe there's caps out there that are
actually<00:03:53.530> better<00:03:56.020> it's<00:03:57.020> pretty<00:03:57.320> neat<00:03:59.650> that<00:04:00.650> is

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
actually better it's pretty neat that is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.690 
actually better it's pretty neat that is
the<00:04:00.980> grisly<00:04:02.440> leave<00:04:03.440> comments<00:04:04.010> below<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.580> know
