00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
time it is a domination match on Skid

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.960 
time it is a domination match on Skid
Row<00:00:05.819> may<00:00:06.810> seem<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.049> little<00:00:07.170> short<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.950> uh<00:00:08.010> there

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
Row may seem a little short but uh there

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.520 
Row may seem a little short but uh there
there<00:00:09.000> might<00:00:09.450> be<00:00:09.480> something<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.110> ends<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
there might be something that ends the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.370 
there might be something that ends the
match<00:00:10.710> before<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.580> match<00:00:11.700> should<00:00:11.940> really<00:00:12.150> end

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
match before the match should really end

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.450 
match before the match should really end

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.170 
them I guess you had the web weapon out
the<00:01:56.790> vehicle<00:01:57.030> perks<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:58.130> road<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.250> war<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.700> guess

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the vehicle perks in road at war I guess

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.399 
the vehicle perks in road at war I guess
it<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.420> sort<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.290> way

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
it was sort of you like that the way

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
it was sort of you like that the way
that<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.649> would<00:02:01.799> implement<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.570> except<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that they would implement but except it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600 
that they would implement but except it
would<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.619> your<00:02:04.740> entire<00:02:05.009> team<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
would be to your entire team and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.389 
would be to your entire team and
apparently<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:08.039> something<00:02:08.369> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
apparently you it's not something you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.859 
apparently you it's not something you
choose<00:02:08.489> before<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> match<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.690> something

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
choose before the match it's something

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.210 
choose before the match it's something
you<00:02:10.140> earn<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.950> during<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.489> match<00:02:11.700> um

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you earn in during the match um

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.420 
you earn in during the match um
and<00:02:13.460> apparently<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:13.940> team<00:02:14.090> chooses<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:15.650> for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and apparently your team chooses I for

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
and apparently your team chooses I for
of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.510> suggestion<00:02:18.110> ones<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.620> were

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
of the suggestion ones that were

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.370 
of the suggestion ones that were
supposed<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:21.040> delete<00:02:22.870> team<00:02:23.870> perks<00:02:24.140> we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
supposed to be delete team perks we're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.200 
supposed to be delete team perks we're
stopping<00:02:24.770> power<00:02:24.920> blast<00:02:25.310> shield<00:02:25.610> health<00:02:25.880> regen

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
stopping power blast shield health regen

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.410 
stopping power blast shield health regen
and<00:02:26.240> sun<00:02:26.540> protection<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:28.370> interesting<00:02:29.210> that

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and sun protection it's interesting that

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.870 
and sun protection it's interesting that
they're<00:02:29.630> keeping<00:02:30.010> stopping<00:02:31.010> power<00:02:31.160> possibly

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
they're keeping stopping power possibly

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.070 
they're keeping stopping power possibly
out<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.150> an<00:02:33.140> actual<00:02:33.500> Forks<00:02:33.890> lot<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:36.050> think

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
out of an actual Forks lot and I think

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.430 
out of an actual Forks lot and I think
the<00:02:36.620> good<00:02:37.550> way<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.850> implement<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.630> in

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the good way to implement it is in

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.530 
the good way to implement it is in
something<00:02:40.130> where<00:02:40.340> if<00:02:40.640> your<00:02:40.820> team<00:02:41.060> does<00:02:41.300> a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
something where if your team does a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.170 
something where if your team does a
certain<00:02:41.870> thing<00:02:42.080> they<00:02:42.290> get<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:43.820> sort<00:02:44.120> of

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
certain thing they get it it sort of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.970 
certain thing they get it it sort of
puts<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.480> burden<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:45.050> during<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.470> game<00:02:45.680> i

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
puts the burden on you during the game i

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.970 
puts the burden on you during the game i
I<00:02:46.880> really<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.650> things<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.890> like

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
I really like one of the things I like

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.630 
I really like one of the things I like
about<00:02:49.040> black<00:02:49.370> ops<00:02:49.400> was<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.970> fact<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:51.640> well

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
about black ops was the fact that I well

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.760 
about black ops was the fact that I well
I<00:02:52.940> I'll<00:02:53.570> say<00:02:54.080> again<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> again<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
I I'll say again and again the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.770 
I I'll say again and again the
killstreaks<00:02:55.340> were<00:02:55.459> definitely<00:02:55.790> uh<00:02:55.910> were<00:02:56.540> spot

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
killstreaks were definitely uh were spot

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.770 
killstreaks were definitely uh were spot
on<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:57.980> far<00:02:58.190> as<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> perks<00:02:58.580> go<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.970> found

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
on but as far as the perks go I found

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.030 
on but as far as the perks go I found
them<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.080> having<00:03:00.110> stopping<00:03:00.680> power<00:03:00.800> allowed

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
them not having stopping power allowed

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.720 
them not having stopping power allowed
me<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.250> free<00:03:01.490> up<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.270> use<00:03:02.480> more<00:03:02.810> fun<00:03:03.080> shit

me to free up and and use more fun shit
and<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:04.940> that's<00:03:05.120> gonna<00:03:05.450> be<00:03:05.570> good<00:03:05.690> change

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
and I think that's gonna be good change

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.800 
and I think that's gonna be good change

looks<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.959> same<00:03:54.110> as<00:03:54.290> anything<00:03:54.470> else<00:03:54.680> but<00:03:54.890> it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
looks the same as anything else but it

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.310 
looks the same as anything else but it
happens<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.400> be<00:03:55.430> booby-trapped<00:03:55.760> um<00:03:56.320> so

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
happens to be booby-trapped um so

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.979 
happens to be booby-trapped um so
doesn't<00:03:57.560> look<00:03:57.650> like<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.510> what<00:03:59.510> was<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.750> called

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
doesn't look like the what was it called

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.430 
doesn't look like the what was it called
forget<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.940> perk<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:04.510> black<00:04:05.510> ops<00:04:05.690> holy<00:04:06.080> shit

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
forget the perk in black ops holy shit

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.130 
forget the perk in black ops holy shit
that<00:04:07.400> was<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:08.000> was<00:04:08.120> something<00:04:08.420> like<00:04:08.450> ninja<00:04:08.930> but

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
that was it was something like ninja but

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.930 
that was it was something like ninja but
I<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:10.010> course<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.400> wasn't<00:04:10.519> injured<00:04:10.850> because

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
I of course it wasn't injured because

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.270 
I of course it wasn't injured because
ninjas<00:04:11.239> in<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.510> game<00:04:11.660> but<00:04:12.290> whatever<00:04:12.890> hacker

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
ninjas in the game but whatever hacker

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.030 
ninjas in the game but whatever hacker
librium<00:04:13.820> hacker<00:04:14.180> pro<00:04:14.420> um<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:15.650> like<00:04:15.739> hacker

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
librium hacker pro um it's like hacker

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.310 
librium hacker pro um it's like hacker
pro<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:16.549> we're<00:04:16.970> probably<00:04:17.450> expecting<00:04:18.109> hacker

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
pro so we're probably expecting hacker

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.620 
pro so we're probably expecting hacker
not<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:19.070> make<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.280> reentrant<00:04:19.790> which<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.239> actually

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
not to make a reentrant which I actually

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.719 
not to make a reentrant which I actually
really<00:04:20.989> liked<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.410> /<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.890> used<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.280> Don<00:04:22.430> all<00:04:22.550> my

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
really liked that / I used to Don all my

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.200 
really liked that / I used to Don all my
classes<00:04:22.940> because<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:24.110> awesome<00:04:24.530> and

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
classes because it's awesome and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.020 
classes because it's awesome and
everybody<00:04:26.210> used<00:04:26.510> care<00:04:26.720> pack

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
everybody used care pack

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.820 
everybody used care pack
is<00:04:27.150> because<00:04:27.510> they<00:04:27.810> were<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.110> ridiculous<00:04:28.620> that

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
is because they were so ridiculous that

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.910 
is because they were so ridiculous that
you<00:04:29.100> could<00:04:29.310> just<00:04:29.490> change<00:04:29.670> them<00:04:29.880> all<00:04:30.060> oh<00:04:30.920> that

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
you could just change them all oh that

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.600 
you could just change them all oh that
was<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.639> was<00:04:32.790> some<00:04:33.030> fun<00:04:33.270> stuff<00:04:33.510> but<00:04:33.840> um<00:04:34.610> let's

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
was that was some fun stuff but um let's

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.940 
was that was some fun stuff but um let's
see<00:04:35.880> what<00:04:36.389> else<00:04:36.419> do<00:04:36.570> we<00:04:36.600> have<00:04:36.660> here<00:04:36.950> remote

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
see what else do we have here remote

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.320 
see what else do we have here remote
mortar<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.700> is<00:04:38.820> actually<00:04:39.030> kind<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.180> cool

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
mortar this is actually kind of cool

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.150 
mortar this is actually kind of cool
it's<00:04:39.840> like<00:04:40.050> more<00:04:40.260> than<00:04:40.410> mortar<00:04:40.710> strikes<00:04:40.950> of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
it's like more than mortar strikes of

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.840 
it's like more than mortar strikes of
battlefield<00:04:41.970> making<00:04:42.240> an<00:04:42.530> entrance<00:04:43.530> onto<00:04:43.850> the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
battlefield making an entrance onto the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.930 
battlefield making an entrance onto the
column<00:04:45.450> 30<00:04:45.750> scene<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.919> really<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.760> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
column 30 scene I really like that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.790 
column 30 scene I really like that
because<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:50.419> difference<00:04:51.419> between<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.900> mortar

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
because the difference between a mortar

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.350 
because the difference between a mortar
and<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.430> air<00:04:53.610> strike<00:04:53.880> which<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.120> making<00:04:54.330> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and the air strike which is making a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.950 
and the air strike which is making a
return<00:04:54.510> is<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:55.919> actually<00:04:55.950> zoom<00:04:56.310> in

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
return is that you can actually zoom in

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.930 
return is that you can actually zoom in
from<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.110> camera<00:04:58.320> view<00:04:58.560> while<00:04:59.340> you're<00:04:59.610> calling

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
from a camera view while you're calling

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.220 
from a camera view while you're calling
it<00:05:00.030> in<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.419> you<00:05:00.480> actually<00:05:00.630> have<00:05:00.810> someone

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
it in so you actually have someone

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.930 
it in so you actually have someone
control<00:05:01.620> not<00:05:01.860> only<00:05:01.890> vertically<00:05:02.820> and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
control not only vertically and

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.440 
control not only vertically and
horizontally<00:05:03.060> but<00:05:03.480> also<00:05:03.630> depth<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:05.300> where<00:05:06.300> you

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
horizontally but also depth of where you

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.520 
horizontally but also depth of where you

are the stealth bomber is making

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.870 
are the stealth bomber is making

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
reappearance so as the precision air

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.230 
reappearance so as the precision air
spray<00:05:09.090> because<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.300> said<00:05:09.660> earlier<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:11.240> what

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
spray because I said earlier and what

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.720 
spray because I said earlier and what
else<00:05:12.330> we<00:05:12.510> have<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:13.100> little<00:05:14.100> tiny<00:05:14.460> remote

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
else we have a little tiny remote

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.730 
else we have a little tiny remote
controlled<00:05:15.180> helicopter<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:16.020> possibly<00:05:16.560> like

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
controlled helicopter so possibly like

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.820 
controlled helicopter so possibly like
the<00:05:16.860> UAV<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.400> battlefield<00:05:17.850> maybe<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:19.229> an<00:05:19.410> EMP

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
the UAV in battlefield maybe and an EMP

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.780 
the UAV in battlefield maybe and an EMP
grenade<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:22.380> is<00:05:22.620> an<00:05:22.950> area<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:23.640> effect

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
grenade and this is an area of effect

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.210 
grenade and this is an area of effect
things<00:05:24.240> so<00:05:24.510> you<00:05:24.540> just<00:05:24.780> toss<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.200> somewhere<00:05:25.950> on

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
things so you just toss it somewhere on

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.800 
things so you just toss it somewhere on
the<00:05:26.400> map<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.790> it<00:05:26.910> takes<00:05:27.090> out<00:05:27.180> all<00:05:27.330> electronics

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
the map and it takes out all electronics

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.810 
the map and it takes out all electronics
within<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.350> area<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:29.430> sort<00:05:29.639> of<00:05:29.700> like

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
within that area so sort of like

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.060 
within that area so sort of like
scrambler<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.210> guess<00:05:30.389> that<00:05:30.810> probably<00:05:31.650> didn't

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
scrambler I guess that probably didn't

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.490 
scrambler I guess that probably didn't
work<00:05:32.310> out<00:05:32.460> as<00:05:32.700> well<00:05:32.729> as<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.570> developers

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
work out as well as the developers

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.740 
work out as well as the developers
intended<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:35.040> in<00:05:35.280> mon<00:05:35.729> /<00:05:35.850> tue<00:05:36.120> because<00:05:36.660> it

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
intended to in mon / tue because it

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.870 
intended to in mon / tue because it
really<00:05:36.900> wasn't<00:05:37.140> used<00:05:37.290> as<00:05:37.410> much<00:05:37.590> people<00:05:38.460> like

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
really wasn't used as much people like

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.440 
really wasn't used as much people like
retarted<00:05:39.330> like<00:05:39.510> me<00:05:39.660> i<00:05:40.620> used<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.729> lot<00:05:41.880> because<00:05:42.060> I

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
retarted like me i used a lot because I

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.180 
retarted like me i used a lot because I
thought<00:05:43.020> it<00:05:43.080> was<00:05:43.200> awesome<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:44.910> man<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:45.750> then

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
thought it was awesome but man and then

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.310 
thought it was awesome but man and then
there<00:05:47.190> is<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.669> protected<00:05:48.570> airdrop<00:05:49.020> which<00:05:49.200> I

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
there is the protected airdrop which I

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.230 
there is the protected airdrop which I
guess<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.650> cannot<00:05:50.010> shoot<00:05:50.310> down<00:05:50.610> which<00:05:51.060> is

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
guess you cannot shoot down which is

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.480 
guess you cannot shoot down which is
kind<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:51.840> nice<00:05:51.990> air<00:05:52.440> drops<00:05:52.800> in<00:05:52.950> itself<00:05:53.220> are

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
kind of nice air drops in itself are

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.409 
kind of nice air drops in itself are
really<00:05:53.970> hard<00:05:54.300> to<00:05:55.550> shoot<00:05:56.550> down<00:05:56.760> so<00:05:57.060> I'm

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
really hard to shoot down so I'm

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.909 
really hard to shoot down so I'm
wondering<00:05:57.630> if<00:05:57.930> it's<00:05:57.990> like<00:05:58.169> drop<00:05:58.470> sense<00:05:58.770> of

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
wondering if it's like drop sense of

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.480 
wondering if it's like drop sense of
turrets<00:05:59.190> on<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.550> actual<00:05:59.760> airdrop<00:06:00.180> itself

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
turrets on the actual airdrop itself

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.760 
turrets on the actual airdrop itself
which<00:06:02.490> would<00:06:02.640> be<00:06:02.729> kind<00:06:02.970> of<00:06:03.000> cool<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:04.650> there

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
which would be kind of cool and there

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.590 
which would be kind of cool and there
are<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:04.979> having<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.310> directional<00:06:05.880> UAV<00:06:06.270> so<00:06:06.510> it's

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
are so having a directional UAV so it's

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.570 
are so having a directional UAV so it's
sort<00:06:06.660> of<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.020> Black<00:06:07.260> Hawk<00:06:07.530> from<00:06:07.890> black

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
sort of like the Black Hawk from black

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.350 
sort of like the Black Hawk from black
ops<00:06:08.820> except<00:06:09.289> probably<00:06:10.289> not<00:06:10.470> as<00:06:10.710> powerful<00:06:11.360> but

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
ops except probably not as powerful but

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.670 
ops except probably not as powerful but
I<00:06:12.390> really<00:06:12.720> think<00:06:12.750> that<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.050> remote<00:06:13.260> mortar<00:06:13.590> is

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
I really think that the remote mortar is

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.020 
I really think that the remote mortar is
actually<00:06:14.039> kind<00:06:14.190> of<00:06:14.220> cool<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.640> seems<00:06:14.940> like

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
actually kind of cool it seems like

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.460 
actually kind of cool it seems like
these<00:06:15.240> are<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.479> lower<00:06:15.690> end<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.080> killstreaks

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
these are the lower end the killstreaks

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.960 
these are the lower end the killstreaks
we<00:06:16.590> haven't<00:06:16.860> really<00:06:17.100> seen<00:06:17.310> what<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.640> high<00:06:17.820> end

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
we haven't really seen what the high end

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.850 
we haven't really seen what the high end
will<00:06:18.240> be<00:06:18.390> but<00:06:19.080> just<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.500> little<00:06:19.620> bit<00:06:19.770> of

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
will be but just a little bit of

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.230 
will be but just a little bit of
speculation<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.729> thought<00:06:20.910> it<00:06:21.030> was<00:06:21.120> cool

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
speculation and I thought it was cool

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.990 
speculation and I thought it was cool
some<00:06:21.660> insight<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.280> what<00:06:23.280> am<00:06:23.370> i<00:06:23.400> doing<00:06:23.640> here<00:06:23.820> i

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
some insight and what am i doing here i

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.340 
some insight and what am i doing here i
have<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.210> mg<00:06:24.419> for<00:06:24.600> i'm<00:06:24.720> finally<00:06:25.020> looking<00:06:25.169> back

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
have the mg for i'm finally looking back

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.490 
have the mg for i'm finally looking back
video<00:06:25.800> as<00:06:25.979> it<00:06:26.669> is<00:06:26.760> winding<00:06:26.940> down<00:06:27.090> but<00:06:27.930> uh<00:06:27.990> was

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
video as it is winding down but uh was

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.529 
video as it is winding down but uh was
really<00:06:28.710> unfortunate<00:06:29.220> that<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.729> game<00:06:30.060> ended

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
really unfortunate that the game ended

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.770 
really unfortunate that the game ended
the<00:06:30.720> way<00:06:30.900> it<00:06:30.930> did<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:32.030> of<00:06:33.030> course<00:06:33.120> we<00:06:33.450> got<00:06:33.539> nude

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
the way it did and of course we got nude

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.190 
the way it did and of course we got nude
so<00:06:34.110> i<00:06:34.320> am<00:06:34.979> sort<00:06:35.220> of<00:06:35.280> angry<00:06:35.550> about<00:06:35.669> that<00:06:35.849> but

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
so i am sort of angry about that but

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.420 
so i am sort of angry about that but
also<00:06:37.200> angry<00:06:37.530> in<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.740> sense<00:06:37.890> that<00:06:37.979> it<00:06:38.310> was<00:06:38.400> a

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
also angry in the sense that it was a

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.300 
also angry in the sense that it was a
very<00:06:38.909> good<00:06:39.330> gaming

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
very good gaming

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.060 
very good gaming
the<00:06:40.400> potential<00:06:40.730> to<00:06:40.910> be<00:06:41.380> just<00:06:42.380> dominating<00:06:42.890> rape

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
the potential to be just dominating rape

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.690 
the potential to be just dominating rape
edge<00:06:43.250> but<00:06:43.850> unfortunately<00:06:44.180> it<00:06:44.870> ended<00:06:45.200> and<00:06:45.700> not

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
edge but unfortunately it ended and not

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.250 
edge but unfortunately it ended and not
much<00:06:46.820> we<00:06:46.940> can<00:06:46.970> do<00:06:47.120> about<00:06:47.210> it<00:06:47.330> so<00:06:47.690> with<00:06:47.960> that<00:06:48.110> I

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
much we can do about it so with that I

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.080 
much we can do about it so with that I
will<00:06:48.380> end<00:06:48.680> if<00:06:49.070> you<00:06:49.220> like<00:06:49.400> to<00:06:49.490> leave<00:06:49.790> it<00:06:49.910> on<00:06:49.970> the
