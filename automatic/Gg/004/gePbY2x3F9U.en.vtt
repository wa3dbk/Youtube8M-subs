00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
battery life because let's face if you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.009 
battery life because let's face if you
have<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> attached<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.149> something<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.750> can't

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have it attached to something you can't

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.399

look<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> LCD<00:01:04.769> anyways<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.140> there's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
look at the LCD anyways so so there's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.219 
look at the LCD anyways so so there's
that<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:11.010> why<00:01:11.189> would<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.729> buy<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> GoPro

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
that now why would I just buy a GoPro

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
that now why would I just buy a GoPro
well<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> can't<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:13.979> talk<00:01:14.549> into

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
well because you can't really talk into

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.649 
well because you can't really talk into
a<00:01:15.030> GoPro<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.900> expect<00:01:16.290> good<00:01:16.500> quality<00:01:17.159> audio

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
a GoPro and expect good quality audio

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
a GoPro and expect good quality audio

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
these microphones down this one the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.840 
these microphones down this one the
microphone<00:01:41.640> actually<00:01:41.820> talks<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.509> ah<00:01:43.850> again

microphone actually talks in ah again
that<00:01:45.329> XY<00:01:45.810> cousin<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> XY

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
that XY cousin you know the XY

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
that XY cousin you know the XY
configuration<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:51.000> similar<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
configuration you know very similar to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
configuration you know very similar to
this<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.409> could<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.740> an<00:01:53.549> additional

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this one and I could put an additional

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
this one and I could put an additional
microphone<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.960> either<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:55.700> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
microphone on either one of these so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.490 
microphone on either one of these so
that's<00:01:57.000> good<00:01:58.340> couple<00:01:59.340> things<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.790> note<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that's good couple things to note is the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.800 
that's good couple things to note is the
zoom<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:02.189> different<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.000> both<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.390> camera

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
zoom are different on both these camera

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.780 
zoom are different on both these camera
this<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.590> could<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.920> more<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.280> gradual

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
this one I could do more of a gradual

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.040 
this one I could do more of a gradual
