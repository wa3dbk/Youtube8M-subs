00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.359
 for many years science fiction 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.579
 has been interested to know how they will be 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.440
 the cities of the future 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.229
 Canada technology we will have discovered 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.140
 what planets we will have colonized without 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.820
 However, few of these imaginations have 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 taken into account that they will get 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 human beings so far we have 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.839
 studied the evolution of homo sapiens 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.610
 from the past but move forward as they will be 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.430
 men and women of 32 thousand 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.600
 years is more complicated and few to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.350
 end in place be there 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 however recently of cholera a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.159
 young artist from pittsburg usa 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.720
 computer made an assignment 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.250
 of how human beings could be 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.600
 of the future within 20 thousand 40 thousand and 100 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.210
 a thousand years 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.850
 if you like science sit and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.040
 relax because this is 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.430
 how will human beings be in the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.789
 future 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.789
 [Music] 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.010
 our report starts with the faces 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.130
 human beings at present with different 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.260
 skin types hair eyes and all 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.420
 features that we have recognized 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.840
 our species has taken a great leap 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.450
 until now but now we will discover what 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.320
 that we could possibly be in about 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.320
 thousands of years 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.520
 twenty thousand years later it will be possible 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.780
 note though small but first detail 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.760
 of our evolution 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.250
 a head a little bigger since such 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.289
 it seems that in our brain it will grow and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.600
 thus being able to accommodate the body with a 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.190
 right head for it too 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.530
 we can notice a light yellow ring 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.720
 around our eyes thus having 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.590
 as a function a better view of which 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.590
 we currently have 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.100
 60,000 years in the future we will see greater 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.569
 changes in our bodies as per 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.209
 example the growth of our 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.440
 heads a little more than what we saw 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.390
 previously together with our eyes 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.819
 that will be larger than normal 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.100
 thus having thicker eyelids 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.040
 together with the skin that will become a 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.750
 little more brunette all this seems 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.760
 it's because if humans get to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.920
 some planets of the solar system its 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.510
 body must adapt to the change well 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.340
 they have a lightning protection 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.319
 ultraviolet 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 [Music] 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.489
 100,000 years in the future the eyes 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.379
 they will have a huge size that will improve 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.749
 the vision in the dark where it is not 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.519
 noticeable light and stronger skin 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.549
 as a protective layer for 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.620
 radiation of our cosmic rays 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.109
 faces will have symmetrical proportions 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.609
 perfect in our nostrils and 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.530
 they will be bigger so that our 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.540
 breathing in our atmosphere it 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.660
 adapt

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.860
 well this was how beings will be 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.860
 humans in the future I hope you've 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.930
 enjoyed the video and good before 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.050
 go to the comments section to 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.819
 criticize insult or in any way 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.890
 comment in bad taste the video 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.889
 let me explain my point first 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.260
 view you probably disagree 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.419
 with this video because what I explained 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.120
 a few seconds ago this ideology that 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.400
 has some people of evolution and 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.050
 surely you have another point of 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.080
 different view 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 more however 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.220
 I want you to listen is mine first 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.819
 nobody absolutely nobody has nor the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.539
 Less idea of ​​what will happen in the future 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:42.569
 that we will know how we think and much 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.899
 less of what actions we take 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:49.499
 the nature is terrifying beautiful 

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:51.629
 brilliant and she is the only one who has 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:55.469
 the power in your hands to choose how 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:57.569
 we will be in the future nobody knows the 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.820
 nature will choose what it is that we 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.070
 it will happen 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.530
 if we will be good enough to 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.530
 the future or if we will die in the attempt 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.860
 if it will turn us into a new race for 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.390
 to survive the changes or if the 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.090
 changes will kill us 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.340
 after all, the only way to 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.370
 know all this will be over time 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.699
 I hope you have selected this that of 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.310
 this video you have learned a bit and that 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.100
 do not try to debate against others because 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.090
 each person is different but in the end 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.870
 time is the one that will decide 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.870
 see you later
