and I was 19 and I remember just

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.310 
and I was 19 and I remember just
thinking<00:01:32.340> oh<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.909> god<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.420> am<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> do

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
thinking oh my god what am I going to do

I'm<00:01:34.530> gonna<00:01:34.650> lose<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.860> hair<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> became

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
I'm gonna lose my hair I became

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480 
I'm gonna lose my hair I became
obsessive<00:01:36.060> about<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.890> thought<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
obsessive about it and I thought this is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
obsessive about it and I thought this is
not<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
not for me I'm not I'm not good at this

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.710 
not for me I'm not I'm not good at this
I<00:01:40.619> can't<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.070> let<00:01:41.280> myself<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.060> front<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I can't just let myself go in front of a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
I can't just let myself go in front of a
camera<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> really<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
camera so what you really have to do to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
camera so what you really have to do to
be<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> great<00:01:45.119> actor<00:01:45.420> after<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> lose

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
be a great actor after you have to lose

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
be a great actor after you have to lose
all<00:01:46.950> vanity<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:48.180> completely<00:01:48.899> let

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
all vanity and just completely let

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.730 
all vanity and just completely let
yourself<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.189> couldn't<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
yourself go and I couldn't do that so I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
yourself go and I couldn't do that so I
thought<00:01:53.159> okay<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.850> am<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> do

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
thought okay well what am I going to do

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
thought okay well what am I going to do
and<00:01:54.659> I'd<00:01:54.990> always<00:01:55.200> been<00:01:55.470> interested<00:01:55.829> in

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and I'd always been interested in

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
and I'd always been interested in
architecture<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.299> had<00:01:57.600> been<00:01:57.750> taking

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

skirts<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.200> thought<00:02:57.350> how<00:02:57.530> how<00:02:58.040> did<00:02:58.220> those

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
skirts and I thought how how did those

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.860 
skirts and I thought how how did those
go<00:02:58.520> together<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.120> got<00:02:59.330> on<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> subway<00:02:59.750> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
go together so I got on the subway I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.270 
go together so I got on the subway I
went<00:03:00.080> up<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.170> Bloomingdale's<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:00.950> flipped

went up to Bloomingdale's and flipped

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.270 
went up to Bloomingdale's and flipped
skirts<00:03:01.670> up<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.060> look<00:03:02.300> where<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> seams<00:03:02.840> went

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
skirts up and look where the seams went

when<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> started<00:03:19.640> in<00:03:19.790> fashion<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.240> was<00:03:20.420> just

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
when I started in fashion I was just

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.440 
when I started in fashion I was just
determined<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.530> succeed<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.310> fashion<00:03:22.670> that's

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
determined to succeed in fashion that's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.449 
determined to succeed in fashion that's
amazing<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.350> don't<00:03:24.830> think<00:03:24.980> people<00:03:25.100> could

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
amazing that I don't think people could

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.830

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
think a lot of people I think if you're

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.710 
think a lot of people I think if you're
determined<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.120> decide<00:03:29.450> you're<00:03:29.600> going

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
determined and you decide you're going

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
to do something you kind of fake it a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.430 
to do something you kind of fake it a
little<00:03:31.850> bit<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.270> jump<00:03:32.600> right<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.230> you

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
little bit and you jump right in and you

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440 
little bit and you jump right in and you
do<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.830> if<00:03:34.010> you're<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.520> kind<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.820> person<00:03:34.880> who
