00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the exposure was just not great and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.569 
the exposure was just not great and
that's<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.409> darn<00:02:04.770> shame<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
that's really a darn shame because the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.819 
that's really a darn shame because the
game<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.759> incredible<00:02:06.030> i<00:02:06.509> mean<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
game was incredible i mean if if you

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.430 
game was incredible i mean if if you
played<00:02:08.069> crysis<00:02:08.459> 2<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.420> graphically<00:02:10.020> had<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
played crysis 2 it graphically had the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.660 
played crysis 2 it graphically had the
opportunity<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> powerhouse<00:02:11.340> i

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
opportunity to be a powerhouse i

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.890 
opportunity to be a powerhouse i
personally<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> graphics

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
personally think the graphics

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.550 
personally think the graphics
this<00:02:13.110> even<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.709> consoles<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.430> better<00:02:15.560> that's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
this even on consoles is better that's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.559 
this even on consoles is better that's
just<00:02:16.650> my<00:02:16.799> opinion<00:02:16.829> of<00:02:17.220> course<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.480> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
just my opinion of course but I think it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.030 
just my opinion of course but I think it
runs<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:18.959> smoother<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> think<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.739> plays

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
runs a little smoother I think it plays

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.589 
runs a little smoother I think it plays
a<00:02:20.069> little<00:02:20.400> better<00:02:20.549> there<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.909> lot<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.120> pop

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
a little better there was a lot of pop

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.839 
a little better there was a lot of pop
in<00:02:21.840> images<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.129> if<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.370> could<00:02:23.519> make<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.819> like

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
in images so if they could make it like

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.740 
in images so if they could make it like
this<00:02:24.590> use<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.769> CryEngine<00:02:26.370> 3<00:02:26.569> use<00:02:27.569> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this use the CryEngine 3 use the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.740 
this use the CryEngine 3 use the
original<00:02:28.319> crisis<00:02:28.829> graphics<00:02:29.519> for<00:02:29.819> ps3<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
original crisis graphics for ps3 and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.449 
original crisis graphics for ps3 and
xbox<00:02:31.170> 360<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.890> know<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.129> can<00:02:32.159> do<00:02:32.310> whatever

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
xbox 360 you know they can do whatever

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.030 
xbox 360 you know they can do whatever
they<00:02:32.579> want<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.879> PC<00:02:33.269> because<00:02:33.450> pcs<00:02:33.959> now<00:02:34.140> are<00:02:34.439> just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
they want on PC because pcs now are just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.880 
they want on PC because pcs now are just
out<00:02:35.189> of<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.489> world<00:02:35.549> amazing<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:37.769> they

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
out of this world amazing but if they

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.690 
out of this world amazing but if they
could<00:02:38.069> do<00:02:38.189> this<00:02:38.519> arm<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:40.290> consoles<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.129> think

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
could do this arm for consoles I think

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.250 
could do this arm for consoles I think
the<00:02:41.790> game<00:02:41.909> would<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.269> incredible<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:43.140> was

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
the game would just be incredible it was

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020 
the game would just be incredible it was

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
this game looks a little better than

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.790 
this game looks a little better than
crisis<00:04:38.520> too<00:04:38.670> but<00:04:39.390> i<00:04:39.630> guess<00:04:39.990> i'll<00:04:40.200> let<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.620> be

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
crisis too but i guess i'll let you be

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.300 
crisis too but i guess i'll let you be
the<00:04:40.950> judge<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:41.400> guy<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:43.260> guess<00:04:44.100> my

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
the judge of that guy so I guess my

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.770 
the judge of that guy so I guess my
wishlists<00:04:44.850> really<00:04:45.180> quick<00:04:46.370> would<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.780> other

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
I think that would be incredible I think

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.850 
I think that would be incredible I think
it<00:05:03.270> would<00:05:03.360> totally<00:05:03.840> make<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:04.500> game

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
it would totally make this game

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.110 
it would totally make this game
incredible<00:05:06.020> make<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.169> just<00:05:07.470> that<00:05:07.830> much<00:05:07.890> better

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
incredible make it just that much better

you know spawn points that can be thrown
places<00:05:23.580> and<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:24.210> think<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.600> is<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.750> type<00:05:25.080> of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
places and I think this is a type of

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.080 
places and I think this is a type of
game<00:05:25.470> that<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:26.040> they<00:05:26.220> could<00:05:26.370> easily<00:05:26.880> do<00:05:27.060> that

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
game that that they could easily do that

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.700 
game that that they could easily do that
kind<00:05:27.479> of<00:05:27.540> thing<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.350> would<00:05:28.440> be<00:05:28.530> very

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
kind of thing and it would be very

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.310
