like to see what you guys have as well
but<00:00:39.090> here's<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.360> opinion<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.530> sr-25<00:00:41.430> Sandfire

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
but here's my opinion so sr-25 Sandfire

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.580 
but here's my opinion so sr-25 Sandfire
i<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> sand<00:00:43.079> fire<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
i really like the sand fire because it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.020 
i really like the sand fire because it
is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> little<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.160> useful<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> regular

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
is a little more useful in the regular

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
is a little more useful in the regular
sr-25<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> semi<00:00:46.860> ideal<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> sound

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
sr-25 but the semi ideal the sound

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
sr-25 but the semi ideal the sound
that's<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.120> quite<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.420> powerful<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.989> most

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that's not quite as powerful as most

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
that's not quite as powerful as most
other<00:00:49.320> send<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:50.190> good<00:00:50.309> idea<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:50.700> like

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
other send these really good idea i like

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
other send these really good idea i like
it<00:00:51.270> fast<00:00:51.780> enough<00:00:51.930> thyroid<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.530> usable<00:00:52.860> but

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it fast enough thyroid to be usable but

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
it fast enough thyroid to be usable but
the<00:00:53.039> recoil<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.820> high<00:00:54.000> enough<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the recoil is just high enough that you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
the recoil is just high enough that you
can't<00:00:54.629> spam<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> indefinitely<00:00:55.379> next<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

this weapon and all that stuff next up

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
this weapon and all that stuff next up
is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> Confederate<00:01:11.820> double-barrel<00:01:12.330> shotgun

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is the Confederate double-barrel shotgun

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
is the Confederate double-barrel shotgun
it's<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.560> dirty<00:01:13.979> version<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's a really dirty version of the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's a really dirty version of the
double<00:01:14.880> barrel<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> whole<00:01:15.540> point<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
double barrel because the whole point of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240 
double barrel because the whole point of
it<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> very<00:01:16.380> short<00:01:16.680> barrel<00:01:17.100> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it is to have a very short barrel that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
it is to have a very short barrel that
you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.490> hide<00:01:17.640> around<00:01:17.850> corners<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you can hide around corners with and the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.359 
you can hide around corners with and the
Confederate<00:01:19.380> double<00:01:19.590> barrel<00:01:19.799> completely

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
Confederate double barrel completely

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.550 
Confederate double barrel completely
loses<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> idea<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.200> seems<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
loses that idea and also it seems to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
loses that idea and also it seems to
have<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.250> worse<00:01:23.430> damage<00:01:23.670> drop<00:01:24.000> off<00:01:24.180> in
