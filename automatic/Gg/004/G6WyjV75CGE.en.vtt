00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
just one is pretty evasive yeah fencing

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.789 
just one is pretty evasive yeah fencing
is<00:01:31.750> obviously<00:01:32.170> pretty<00:01:32.350> difficult<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.740> block

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
is obviously pretty difficult to block

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.380 
is obviously pretty difficult to block
once<00:01:33.100> he<00:01:33.159> gets<00:01:33.280> counter<00:01:33.549> or<00:01:33.640> two<00:01:33.759> on<00:01:33.909> him<00:01:34.030> yeah

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
once he gets counter or two on him yeah

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.450 
once he gets counter or two on him yeah
phalanx<00:01:35.020> leader<00:01:35.439> gets<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.890> little<00:01:36.070> bigger<00:01:36.250> than

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
phalanx leader gets a little bigger than

think that's probably the best part in
the<00:03:14.590> deck<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.100> maybe<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.430> car<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:15.760> were

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
the deck and maybe the car that we were

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.979 
the deck and maybe the car that we were
trying<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.180> exploit<00:03:16.690> motor<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.780> mana
