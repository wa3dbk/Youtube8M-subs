00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.460
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.990
 a success video of ecclesia in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 this video we want the success 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 sovereign advantage make it in 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.670
 the living history the battle 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.740
 There is a lot to do for LÃ¶wenstein 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 to mark off various projections 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 I went and went to this way 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.699
 I'm just following the off-road brand 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 and on the right side of here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 we actually tower once with the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.390
 should be done and this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.219
 teleporter now works this 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.700
 bring us into the story instance 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.920
 change scarletts and give her the thing 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.739
 you can use one of them 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 this new vortex sounds back for 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.550
 a success but sovereign advantage 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.100
 just have to talk to thomas and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 it also explains a bit to you 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 Her back to the teleporter he needs 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 just keep this whirlwind blade down because you 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.649
 who have already built to have possessed 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 then before this life story would have 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 you most likely the socks 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 take off and put on again with the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.710
 character of the back has to do with it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 build up the successes backbone and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 can build success with the backbone 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.270
 you then use the teleporter with 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.290
 Whatever your character remains 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.750
 then leave 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 done more info to the should 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.159
 find on my blog and otherwise can 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.259
 this little shortcut to the story ins 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.570
 otherwise to use either the history 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 is to make us for the first time or 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 to make it more likely that he for 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.380
 example successes as a sure 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.810
 I can hope to complete that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 video was helpful , you know you have questions 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.900
 then please write that in the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 comments or on my blog 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.689
 Do the same with the others 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.430
 successes are also listed 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.250
 you can see you can just go in and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.049
 get out and do that as often as you want and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.229
 often experience as you want 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.450
 I hope we will meet again 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.549

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.140
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.880

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.880
