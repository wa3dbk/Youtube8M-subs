morgan into the game with its original
AC<00:00:07.649> set<00:00:08.069> loader<00:00:08.280> which<00:00:08.940> means<00:00:09.150> they've<00:00:09.300> also

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
AC set loader which means they've also

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.720 
AC set loader which means they've also
added<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.080> multi-purpose<00:00:10.679> burst<00:00:11.250> missile<00:00:11.580> or

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
added the multi-purpose burst missile or

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.370 
added the multi-purpose burst missile or
mvvm<00:00:12.690> into<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> game

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.580 

so<00:00:16.370> after<00:00:16.880> unlocking<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.360> mvvm<00:00:17.870> for<00:00:18.020> myself<00:00:18.380> I

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
so after unlocking the mvvm for myself I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.080 
so after unlocking the mvvm for myself I
decided<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:19.310> give<00:00:19.460> it<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.640> variety<00:00:20.060> of

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
decided to give it a variety of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.960 
decided to give it a variety of
different<00:00:20.300> tests<00:00:20.840> now<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.010> MP<00:00:22.280> BIA<00:00:22.460> has<00:00:22.910> a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
different tests now the MP BIA has a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.620 
different tests now the MP BIA has a
massive<00:00:23.570> explosion<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:24.710> I'm<00:00:25.040> huge<00:00:28.510> so<00:00:29.510> it

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
massive explosion and I'm huge so it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.150 
massive explosion and I'm huge so it
only<00:00:29.750> makes<00:00:30.020> sense<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.410> compare<00:00:30.619> this<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:31.070> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
only makes sense to compare this to the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.640 
only makes sense to compare this to the
FA<00:00:31.490> EB<00:00:31.850> the<00:00:32.300> feel<00:00:32.599> air<00:00:32.809> bomb<00:00:33.020> that<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.320> a-10

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
FA EB the feel air bomb that the a-10

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.650 
FA EB the feel air bomb that the a-10
carries

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
carries

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.180 
carries
now<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.720> filled<00:00:36.050> air<00:00:36.230> bomb<00:00:36.440> has<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.830> largest

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
now the filled air bomb has the largest

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.310 
now the filled air bomb has the largest
area<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.610> effect<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.270> any<00:00:38.600> bomb<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.140> game

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
area of effect of any bomb in the game

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.290 
area of effect of any bomb in the game
capable<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.220> hitting<00:00:40.340> all<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:40.700> dummy<00:00:40.910> targets

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
capable of hitting all the dummy targets

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.880 
capable of hitting all the dummy targets
in<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:41.480> large<00:00:41.690> cluster<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.470> let's<00:00:42.650> see<00:00:42.800> how

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
in this large cluster so let's see how

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.500 
in this large cluster so let's see how
the<00:00:42.949> M<00:00:43.160> ppm<00:00:43.610> explosion<00:00:44.239> compares<00:00:48.370> boom

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
the M ppm explosion compares boom

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.049 
the M ppm explosion compares boom
complete<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.750> utter<00:00:51.050> destruction<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:52.850> dummy

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
complete and utter destruction but dummy

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.910 
complete and utter destruction but dummy
targets<00:00:53.479> are<00:00:53.570> we<00:00:53.690> can<00:00:53.960> very<00:00:54.170> easy<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.620> destroy

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
targets are we can very easy to destroy

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.799 
targets are we can very easy to destroy
so<00:00:55.640> let's<00:00:55.820> see<00:00:55.909> how<00:00:56.059> much<00:00:56.210> damage<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.690> does

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
so let's see how much damage it does

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.790 
so let's see how much damage it does
that<00:00:57.050> gets<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.290> variety<00:00:57.769> of<00:00:57.800> different<00:00:58.159> targets

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
that gets a variety of different targets

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.200 
that gets a variety of different targets
first<00:01:00.800> up<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.280> refineries<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.000> pipelines

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
first up the refineries and pipelines

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.540 
first up the refineries and pipelines
destruction<00:01:03.019> now<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.680> refineries<00:01:04.370> are

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
destruction now the refineries are

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.030 
destruction now the refineries are
clusters<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:04.970> medium<00:01:05.510> health<00:01:05.750> targets<00:01:06.380> there

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
clusters of medium health targets there

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.230 
clusters of medium health targets there
are<00:01:07.130> worth<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> lot<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.520> points<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.030> many

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
are worth a lot of points so many

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.870 
are worth a lot of points so many
players<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.930> namely<00:01:09.440> ground<00:01:09.650> attackers<00:01:10.190> race

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
players and namely ground attackers race

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.630 
players and namely ground attackers race
to<00:01:11.030> get<00:01:11.180> them<00:01:11.360> at<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.570> start<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.900> match

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
to get them at the start of the match

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.880 
to get them at the start of the match
now<00:01:13.640> ug<00:01:14.299> bees<00:01:14.510> are<00:01:14.900> very<00:01:14.960> effective<00:01:15.590> against

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
now ug bees are very effective against

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.350 
now ug bees are very effective against
them<00:01:16.010> destroying<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.820> entire<00:01:17.060> cluster

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
them destroying the entire cluster

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.679 
them destroying the entire cluster
involved<00:01:17.870> she<00:01:17.990> bombs<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:19.490> M<00:01:19.610> PBM<00:01:20.030> however<00:01:20.420> can

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
involved she bombs the M PBM however can

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.840 
involved she bombs the M PBM however can
only<00:01:20.780> be<00:01:20.960> fired<00:01:21.170> one<00:01:21.409> at<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.619> time<00:01:21.829> so<00:01:22.520> let's<00:01:22.759> see

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
only be fired one at a time so let's see

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.690 
only be fired one at a time so let's see
just<00:01:23.000> how<00:01:23.180> much<00:01:23.329> damage<00:01:23.570> it'll<00:01:24.020> do

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.609 

now<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.969> leaves<00:01:29.179> a<00:01:29.420> sliver<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.929> health<00:01:30.289> left<00:01:30.469> on

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
now it leaves a sliver of health left on

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.899 
now it leaves a sliver of health left on
those<00:01:30.770> refineries<00:01:31.100> which<00:01:31.520> means<00:01:31.729> that

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
those refineries which means that

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.849 
those refineries which means that
players<00:01:32.359> can<00:01:32.569> come<00:01:32.749> in<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.109> just<00:01:33.289> steal<00:01:33.710> those

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
players can come in and just steal those

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.429 
players can come in and just steal those
kills<00:01:34.159> from<00:01:34.280> users<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.929> can<00:01:36.079> just<00:01:36.259> save

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
kills from users but you can just save

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.809 
kills from users but you can just save
them<00:01:36.619> with<00:01:36.740> guns<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.219> take<00:01:37.399> them<00:01:37.549> out<00:01:37.670> just

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
them with guns and take them out just

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:38.609 
them with guns and take them out just
like<00:01:37.969> that

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
like that

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:47.800 
like that
assuming<00:01:39.619> you're<00:01:39.740> lucky<00:01:45.880> with<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.030> M<00:01:47.149> PBM<00:01:47.599> we

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
assuming you're lucky with the M PBM we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.660 
assuming you're lucky with the M PBM we
can<00:01:47.990> now<00:01:48.140> give<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.619> infamous<00:01:49.039> subcarrier

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
can now give the infamous subcarrier

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.339 
can now give the infamous subcarrier

vignetting<00:01:59.179> -<00:01:59.359> yes<00:02:00.159> all<00:02:01.159> right<00:02:01.219> let's<00:02:01.789> take

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
vignetting - yes all right let's take

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.630 
vignetting - yes all right let's take
this<00:02:02.209> thing<00:02:02.270> down

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.730 

well<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.780> didn't<00:02:12.110> seem<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.290> do<00:02:12.380> anything<00:02:12.650> at

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.580 
another player is missiles I've hit hit
or<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.860> took<00:05:08.640> double<00:05:08.940> damage<00:05:09.270> let's<00:05:10.230> try<00:05:10.380> again

or I took double damage let's try again

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.030 
or I took double damage let's try again
on<00:05:10.740> this<00:05:11.250> set<00:05:11.460> here

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.450 

far<00:05:15.670> away<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:17.350> yeah<00:05:17.560> double<00:05:18.040> damage<00:05:18.340> on

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
far away and yeah double damage on

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.940

target<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:18.970> hit<00:05:19.680> except<00:05:20.680> for<00:05:20.860> the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
target that I hit except for the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.860 
target that I hit except for the
applying<00:05:21.250> engine<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:24.670> that's<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.090> wrap<00:05:25.270> up<00:05:25.450> so

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
applying engine and that's a wrap up so

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.290 
applying engine and that's a wrap up so
the<00:05:26.080> N<00:05:26.170> ppm<00:05:26.650> turns<00:05:26.860> out<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.130> be<00:05:27.160> another<00:05:28.000> half

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
the N ppm turns out to be another half

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.750 
the N ppm turns out to be another half
AE<00:05:28.450> bomb<00:05:28.870> with<00:05:29.140> a<00:05:29.170> bigger<00:05:29.620> explosion<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.640> can

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
AE bomb with a bigger explosion you can

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.280 
AE bomb with a bigger explosion you can
easily<00:05:30.940> dispatch<00:05:31.420> a<00:05:31.540> large<00:05:31.720> group<00:05:32.020> of<00:05:32.080> lightly

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
easily dispatch a large group of lightly

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.010 
easily dispatch a large group of lightly
armored<00:05:32.680> targets<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:34.120> it<00:05:34.420> can't<00:05:34.780> take<00:05:34.900> your

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
armored targets but it can't take your

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.140 
armored targets but it can't take your
air<00:05:35.230> targets<00:05:35.440> effectively<00:05:36.250> or<00:05:36.610> take<00:05:36.910> on<00:05:37.060> the

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
air targets effectively or take on the

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.570 
air targets effectively or take on the
ion<00:05:37.600> so<00:05:37.990> it<00:05:38.080> lacks<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.470> punch<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.920> PG<00:05:39.370> B's

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
ion so it lacks the punch that PG B's

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.300 
ion so it lacks the punch that PG B's
and<00:05:39.940> for<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.330> am's<00:05:40.690> have<00:05:40.960> in<00:05:41.620> a<00:05:41.770> way<00:05:41.890> this<00:05:42.100> is<00:05:42.160> a

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
and for a am's have in a way this is a

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.830 
and for a am's have in a way this is a
good<00:05:42.520> thing<00:05:42.700> because<00:05:43.000> you<00:05:43.270> certainly<00:05:43.510> don't

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
good thing because you certainly don't

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.450 
good thing because you certainly don't
want<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.290> have<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.470> super<00:05:44.740> weapon<00:05:44.890> destroying

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
want to have a super weapon destroying

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.190 
want to have a super weapon destroying
what<00:05:45.700> balance<00:05:45.940> there<00:05:46.330> is<00:05:46.360> in<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.750> game<00:05:46.960> now

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
what balance there is in the game now

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.230

despite the downfalls I'm still going to
continue<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.690> use<00:05:49.840> these<00:05:49.960> missiles<00:05:50.350> because

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
continue to use these missiles because

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.130
