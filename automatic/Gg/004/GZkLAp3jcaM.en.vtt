describes what we're talking about with

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.470 
describes what we're talking about with
balance<00:00:33.070> right<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.880> different<00:00:34.210> take

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
balance right and it's a different take

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.350 
balance right and it's a different take
on<00:00:34.690> balance<00:00:35.170> where<00:00:35.380> it's<00:00:35.820> asymmetrical<00:00:36.820> so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
on balance where it's asymmetrical so

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.960 
on balance where it's asymmetrical so
you'll<00:00:37.540> notice<00:00:37.809> it's<00:00:38.170> not<00:00:38.290> your<00:00:39.010> perfectly

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
you'll notice it's not your perfectly

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.049 
you'll notice it's not your perfectly
designed<00:00:40.150> on<00:00:40.570> each<00:00:40.780> side<00:00:41.110> kind<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.860> look<00:00:42.309> but

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
designed on each side kind of look but

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.810 
designed on each side kind of look but
you<00:00:43.180> know<00:00:43.570> balance<00:00:44.140> exactly<00:00:44.830> exactly<00:00:45.100> but<00:00:45.699> it

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
you know balance exactly exactly but it

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.450 
you know balance exactly exactly but it
still<00:00:46.150> has<00:00:46.330> a<00:00:46.360> balance<00:00:46.930> in<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.949> weight<00:00:48.160> in<00:00:48.400> the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
still has a balance in the weight in the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.400 
still has a balance in the weight in the
feel<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.600> was<00:00:49.780> very<00:00:49.989> intentional

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
feel of it and that was very intentional

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.160 
feel of it and that was very intentional
of<00:00:51.000> creating<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.150> asymmetrical<00:00:52.960> pattern

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
of creating that asymmetrical pattern

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.889 
of creating that asymmetrical pattern
actually<00:00:53.560> your<00:00:54.399> eye<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.640> drawn<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.510> patterns

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
actually your eye is drawn to patterns

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.020 
actually your eye is drawn to patterns
like<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.140> where<00:00:56.950> you<00:00:57.040> try<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.399> figure<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:57.940> out

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
like that where you try to figure it out

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.360 
like that where you try to figure it out
so<00:00:58.780> it's<00:00:59.020> more<00:00:59.260> interesting<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.100> have

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
so it's more interesting to have

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.250 
so it's more interesting to have
something<00:01:00.670> that's<00:01:00.820> asymmetrical<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.110> it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
something that's asymmetrical and it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.950 
something that's asymmetrical and it
makes<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:02.590> more<00:01:02.829> eye-catching<00:01:03.300> piece<00:01:04.300> tell<00:01:04.839> me

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
makes it more eye-catching piece tell me

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.210 
makes it more eye-catching piece tell me
a<00:01:05.020> little<00:01:05.110> bit<00:01:05.229> about<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.590> beads<00:01:05.830> that<00:01:06.070> you

beautiful you look at it and you're not
really<00:01:49.180> sure<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.439> just<00:01:50.470> catches

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799

colors together and then you see sort of

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.010 
colors together and then you see sort of
balance<00:01:54.939> there<00:01:55.240> yeah<00:01:55.540> because<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:55.840> brings

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
balance there yeah because this brings

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.630 
balance there yeah because this brings

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
certain things that you wouldn't have

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.050 
colors and some are just the real subtle
tones<00:02:05.470> which<00:02:05.799> are<00:02:05.950> just<00:02:06.159> beautiful<00:02:06.610> together

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
tones which are just beautiful together

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.210 
tones which are just beautiful together
alright<00:02:07.869> now<00:02:08.079> you<00:02:08.350> have<00:02:08.530> everything<00:02:08.829> all<00:02:09.040> laid

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
alright now you have everything all laid

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.580 
alright now you have everything all laid
out<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.850> board<00:02:10.090> right<00:02:10.690> well<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.959> start<00:02:11.410> with

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
out on the board right well I start with

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.699 
out on the board right well I start with
my<00:02:12.100> wire<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> 49<00:02:13.959> strand<00:02:14.350> which

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
my wire and so this is a 49 strand which

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.160 
my wire and so this is a 49 strand which
is<00:02:14.890> durable<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.549> it's<00:02:15.700> very<00:02:15.820> flexible<00:02:16.239> so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
is durable but it's very flexible so

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.810 
is durable but it's very flexible so
I'll<00:02:17.290> measure<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.739> out<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.489> 28

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
I'll measure that out this one is 28

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.060 
I'll measure that out this one is 28
inches<00:02:19.299> that<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.540> start<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:19.959> okay<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.620> I'm

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
inches that I start with okay and I'm

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.120 
inches that I start with okay and I'm
starting<00:02:21.430> at<00:02:21.700> one<00:02:21.880> end<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:23.440> lay<00:02:23.829> all<00:02:24.100> my

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
starting at one end and I lay all my

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.819 
starting at one end and I lay all my
beads<00:02:24.610> out<00:02:24.880> first<00:02:25.329> and<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.959> still<00:02:26.620> based

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
beads out first and this is still based

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.420 
beads out first and this is still based
on<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.070> random<00:02:27.459> or<00:02:27.970> chaos<00:02:28.510> pattern<00:02:29.079> so<00:02:29.430> you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
on a random or chaos pattern so you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.250 
on a random or chaos pattern so you
don't<00:02:30.609> have<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.850> go<00:02:30.970> one<00:02:31.359> seed<00:02:31.600> bead<00:02:31.750> here<00:02:31.989> once

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
don't have to go one seed bead here once

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.309 
don't have to go one seed bead here once
we<00:02:32.440> unite<00:02:32.739> yeah

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
we unite yeah

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.739 
we unite yeah
exactly<00:02:33.859> it<00:02:34.549> would<00:02:34.640> be<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.879> little<00:02:35.090> difficult

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:35.749 
exactly it would be a little difficult

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.379 
exactly it would be a little difficult
to<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.319> try<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.849> lay<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:37.969> out<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.150> this

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
to do it but I try to lay it out on this

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.780 
to do it but I try to lay it out on this
on<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:39.019> beadboard<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.799> we<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.099> see<00:02:40.400> kind<00:02:40.730> of

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
on the beadboard so we can see kind of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.270 
on the beadboard so we can see kind of
that<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.969> colors<00:02:41.480> are<00:02:41.689> blended<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.469> all<00:02:42.709> areas

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
that the colors are blended in all areas

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.910 
that the colors are blended in all areas
that<00:02:43.999> I<00:02:44.329> like<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.900> weight<00:02:45.139> of<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.530> before<00:02:45.889> I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that I like the weight of it before I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.619 
that I like the weight of it before I
get<00:02:46.099> started<00:02:46.579> on<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.060> what's<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.389> gauge

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
get started on it and what's the gauge

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.670 
get started on it and what's the gauge
of<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.930> Strand

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
of the Strand

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.080 
of the Strand
I<00:02:48.709> know<00:02:48.829> it's<00:02:48.980> 49<00:02:49.370> strand<00:02:49.549> but<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.879> gauge

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
I know it's 49 strand but with gauge

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.990 
I know it's 49 strand but with gauge
you're<00:02:50.329> using<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.840> think<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.379> a<00:02:51.409> 1/8<00:02:52.400> 18

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
you're using I think this is a 1/8 18

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.280 
you're using I think this is a 1/8 18
okay<00:02:53.569> yeah<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.260> 20<00:02:54.889> and<00:02:55.159> so<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:56.900> one<00:02:57.139> is

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
okay yeah on a 20 and so this one is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.990 
okay yeah on a 20 and so this one is
just<00:02:57.530> really<00:02:57.980> easy<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.280> work<00:02:58.459> with<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.819> like

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
just really easy to work with and I like

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.940 
just really easy to work with and I like
that<00:02:59.209> strand<00:02:59.599> what<00:03:00.079> I've<00:03:00.200> done<00:03:00.409> here<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.829> I've

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
that strand what I've done here is I've

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.640 
that strand what I've done here is I've
started<00:03:01.340> with<00:03:01.669> my<00:03:02.060> toggle<00:03:02.359> clasp<00:03:02.749> mm-hmm<00:03:03.409> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
started with my toggle clasp mm-hmm and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.289 
started with my toggle clasp mm-hmm and
you'll<00:03:03.889> notice<00:03:04.069> also<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.489> I'm<00:03:04.669> using<00:03:04.819> silver

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
you'll notice also that I'm using silver

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.319 
you'll notice also that I'm using silver
with<00:03:05.599> brown<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.230> think<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.189> is<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.700> a

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
with brown I think that that is just a

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.270 
with brown I think that that is just a
real<00:03:08.540> fresh<00:03:08.959> look<00:03:09.319> sometimes<00:03:09.859> because<00:03:10.159> we

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
real fresh look sometimes because we

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.640 
real fresh look sometimes because we
expect<00:03:10.730> gold<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:11.959> many<00:03:12.139> people<00:03:12.349> are<00:03:12.439> into

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
expect gold so many people are into

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.530 
expect gold so many people are into
silver<00:03:12.889> it's<00:03:13.129> a<00:03:13.250> way<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.400> filling<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.269> that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
silver it's a way of filling to that

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.069 
silver it's a way of filling to that
audience<00:03:15.019> so<00:03:15.500> I've<00:03:15.650> started<00:03:15.829> at<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.760> end<00:03:17.079> as

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
audience so I've started at one end as

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.360 
audience so I've started at one end as
normal<00:03:18.680> I've<00:03:18.879> put<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:20.169> crimp<00:03:21.169> bead<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:22.340> I

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
normal I've put a crimp bead and then I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.550 
normal I've put a crimp bead and then I
did<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.819> seed<00:03:23.180> bead<00:03:23.419> then<00:03:23.930> went<00:03:24.260> through<00:03:24.439> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
did a seed bead then went through the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.890 
did a seed bead then went through the
toggle<00:03:24.980> clasp<00:03:25.250> back<00:03:26.120> through<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.449> seed<00:03:26.689> bead

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
toggle clasp back through the seed bead

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.229 
toggle clasp back through the seed bead
and<00:03:27.109> then<00:03:27.409> did<00:03:27.949> the<00:03:28.129> crimp<00:03:28.400> bead<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.879> what

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
and then did the crimp bead and what

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.330 
and then did the crimp bead and what
that<00:03:29.419> does<00:03:29.629> is<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.959> puts<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.439> seed<00:03:30.859> bead<00:03:31.099> a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that does is it puts a seed bead a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.580 
that does is it puts a seed bead a
little<00:03:31.669> color<00:03:31.909> up<00:03:32.239> right<00:03:32.659> by<00:03:32.900> your<00:03:33.319> toggle

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
little color up right by your toggle

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.679 
little color up right by your toggle
clasp<00:03:33.889> just<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.609> add<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> little<00:03:35.060> color<00:03:35.359> in

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
clasp just to add a little color in

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.869 
clasp just to add a little color in
there<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.079> just<00:03:36.169> uh<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.340> no<00:03:37.519> extra

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
there and just uh you know and no extra

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.599 
there and just uh you know and no extra
expense<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.479> little<00:03:38.930> pizzazz<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:39.859> now<00:03:40.549> I

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
expense a little pizzazz there now I

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.210 
expense a little pizzazz there now I
start<00:03:41.120> out<00:03:41.299> with<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:42.169> smaller<00:03:42.530> beads<00:03:42.799> like

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
start out with the smaller beads like

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.920 
start out with the smaller beads like
the<00:03:43.370> seed<00:03:43.609> beads<00:03:43.879> and<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.239> allows<00:03:44.599> it<00:03:44.900> to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the seed beads and that allows it to

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.679 
the seed beads and that allows it to
have<00:03:45.560> more<00:03:45.829> flexibility<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.609> lay<00:03:46.790> flat<00:03:47.150> right

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
have more flexibility to lay flat right

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.809 
have more flexibility to lay flat right
on<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.019> back<00:03:48.169> of<00:03:48.199> my<00:03:48.439> neck<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.889> then<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.459> go

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
on the back of my neck and then I go

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.899 
on the back of my neck and then I go
into<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.120> random<00:03:50.659> so<00:03:50.870> I've<00:03:51.079> started<00:03:51.439> with<00:03:51.909> some

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
into a random so I've started with some

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.520 
into a random so I've started with some
of<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.329> different<00:03:53.629> the<00:03:53.810> bicone<00:03:54.290> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
of the just different the bicone the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.670 
of the just different the bicone the
seed<00:03:54.799> beads<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:56.060> round<00:03:56.359> beads<00:03:56.810> some<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
seed beads the round beads some of the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.599 
seed beads the round beads some of the
spacers<00:03:58.569> doing<00:03:59.569> some<00:03:59.870> routines<00:04:00.470> yeah<00:04:00.949> just

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
spacers doing some routines yeah just

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.569 
spacers doing some routines yeah just
some<00:04:01.819> different<00:04:02.180> ones<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.989> do<00:04:03.290> all<00:04:04.040> kinds<00:04:04.519> of

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
some different ones to do all kinds of

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.069 
some different ones to do all kinds of
different<00:04:04.759> looks<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.359> again<00:04:05.629> kind<00:04:05.930> of

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
different looks but again kind of

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.020 
different looks but again kind of
following<00:04:06.530> down<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:06.859> bead<00:04:07.250> board<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:07.729> I<00:04:07.819> get

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
following down the bead board so I get

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.059 
following down the bead board so I get
all<00:04:08.239> my<00:04:08.389> colors<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.900> there<00:04:09.049> now<00:04:09.620> you'll<00:04:09.799> see

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
all my colors in there now you'll see

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.460 
all my colors in there now you'll see
that<00:04:10.099> there<00:04:10.519> are<00:04:10.549> six<00:04:11.479> different<00:04:11.599> bead<00:04:12.169> frames

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
that there are six different bead frames

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.890 
that there are six different bead frames
on<00:04:12.859> this<00:04:13.099> one<00:04:13.310> okay<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:13.699> so<00:04:14.000> I'll<00:04:14.629> show<00:04:14.810> you

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
on this one okay and so I'll show you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.420 
on this one okay and so I'll show you
kind<00:04:15.109> of<00:04:15.169> how<00:04:15.229> to<00:04:15.319> put<00:04:15.680> one<00:04:15.829> of<00:04:15.949> those<00:04:16.099> together

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
kind of how to put one of those together

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.860 
kind of how to put one of those together
I'll<00:04:17.150> take<00:04:17.719> my<00:04:17.959> strand<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.979> I<00:04:19.909> have<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.389> bead

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
I'll take my strand and I have a bead

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.209 
I'll take my strand and I have a bead
frame<00:04:21.139> and<00:04:21.349> as<00:04:21.440> you'll<00:04:21.590> see<00:04:21.650> again<00:04:22.009> it's

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
frame and as you'll see again it's

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.219 
frame and as you'll see again it's
silver<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:22.880> has<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.330> same<00:04:23.539> pattern<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:24.050> both

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
silver it has the same pattern on both

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.589 
silver it has the same pattern on both
sides<00:04:24.469> so<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:24.889> very<00:04:25.039> nice<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.639> go<00:04:26.150> through<00:04:26.389> one

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
sides so it's very nice I go through one

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.310 
sides so it's very nice I go through one
in<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.229> then<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:27.860> pop<00:04:28.159> the<00:04:28.909> wire<00:04:29.060> up<00:04:29.360> on<00:04:29.810> this

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
in and then I pop the wire up on this

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.510 
in and then I pop the wire up on this
one<00:04:30.590> I'm<00:04:30.860> putting<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.840> seed<00:04:32.840> bead<00:04:33.050> mm-hmm<00:04:33.919> it's

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
one I'm putting a seed bead mm-hmm it's

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.180 
one I'm putting a seed bead mm-hmm it's
a<00:04:34.580> little<00:04:34.820> hard<00:04:34.969> to<00:04:35.030> see<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:35.539> it<00:04:35.810> is<00:04:36.110> there<00:04:36.440> and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
a little hard to see but it is there and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.600 
a little hard to see but it is there and
then<00:04:37.729> my<00:04:38.300> bicone<00:04:38.870> which<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:40.039> just<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.400> nice

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
then my bicone which is just a nice

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.529 
then my bicone which is just a nice
brilliant<00:04:41.979> crystal<00:04:42.979> there<00:04:43.130> another<00:04:44.000> very

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
brilliant crystal there another very

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.900 
brilliant crystal there another very
small<00:04:44.659> brown<00:04:45.349> seed<00:04:45.770> bead<00:04:45.979> and<00:04:46.219> I<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:46.550> add

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
small brown seed bead and I just add

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.730 
small brown seed bead and I just add
a little<00:04:47.270> bit<00:04:47.420> more<00:04:47.660> detail<00:04:48.140> right<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.680> I

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
a little bit more detail right and I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.170 
a little bit more detail right and I
think<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:48.980> seed<00:04:49.190> beads<00:04:49.430> also<00:04:49.640> helps<00:04:49.970> with<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
think the seed beads also helps with the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.330 
think the seed beads also helps with the
balance<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.720> set<00:04:50.900> up<00:04:50.990> right<00:04:51.200> center<00:04:51.800> bead<00:04:51.980> so

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
balance is set up right center bead so

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.160 
balance is set up right center bead so
that<00:04:52.580> kind<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.300> holds<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.960> middle

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
that kind of holds it in the middle

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.160 
that kind of holds it in the middle
there<00:04:54.350> then<00:04:55.010> I<00:04:55.370> go<00:04:55.700> back<00:04:55.970> through<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.960> other

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
there then I go back through the other

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.160 
there then I go back through the other
side<00:04:57.530> of<00:04:57.890> my<00:04:58.040> bead<00:04:58.250> frame<00:04:58.580> mm-hmm<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.390> that

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
side of my bead frame mm-hmm and that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.470 
side of my bead frame mm-hmm and that
gives<00:05:00.620> me<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.950> full<00:05:01.160> look<00:05:01.460> that's<00:05:01.820> great<00:05:02.150> yeah

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
gives me the full look that's great yeah

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.540 
gives me the full look that's great yeah
then<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.230> just<00:05:03.410> go<00:05:03.590> ahead<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:04.010> just<00:05:04.190> string

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
then you just go ahead and just string

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.180 
then you just go ahead and just string
the<00:05:04.790> entire<00:05:05.120> thing<00:05:05.540> do<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.990> entire<00:05:06.440> thing<00:05:06.500> and

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
the entire thing do the entire thing and

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.940 
the entire thing do the entire thing and
then<00:05:07.850> there<00:05:08.480> is<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.630> strand<00:05:09.050> in<00:05:09.290> the<00:05:09.320> middle<00:05:09.620> to

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
then there is a strand in the middle to

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.700 
then there is a strand in the middle to
accent<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.790> rest<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:11.090> it<00:05:11.290> okay<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.470> then<00:05:12.590> the

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
accent the rest of it okay and then the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.650 
accent the rest of it okay and then the
pendant<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.250> just<00:05:13.580> sort<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:13.940> just<00:05:14.210> add<00:05:14.420> that

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
pendant you just sort of just add that

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.930 
pendant you just sort of just add that
on<00:05:14.840> right<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.410> pendant<00:05:15.830> again<00:05:16.070> is<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.670> bead

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
on right the pendant again is that bead

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.240 
on right the pendant again is that bead
frame<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.540> then<00:05:18.260> after<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.860> bead<00:05:18.980> frame

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
frame and then after the bead frame

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.520 
frame and then after the bead frame
crimp<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:19.970> off<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:20.720> you<00:05:21.050> have<00:05:21.200> your<00:05:21.230> two

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
crimp that off and you have your two

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.770 
crimp that off and you have your two
strands<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.160> doing<00:05:22.400> two<00:05:22.640> random<00:05:23.210> strands<00:05:23.600> at

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
strands and doing two random strands at

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.510 
strands and doing two random strands at
the<00:05:23.870> end<00:05:24.020> at<00:05:24.200> different<00:05:24.740> lengths<00:05:25.040> beautiful

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
the end at different lengths beautiful

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.340 
the end at different lengths beautiful
add<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:25.970> that<00:05:26.090> balance<00:05:26.300> look<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.050> we<00:05:27.170> could

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
add to that balance look and we could

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.710 
add to that balance look and we could
see<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.650> with<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.980> finished<00:05:28.640> project<00:05:28.850> you<00:05:29.570> can

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
see it with the finished project you can

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.060 
see it with the finished project you can
see<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.990> Strand<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.590> does<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.920> has<00:05:31.040> a

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
see the Strand and it does it has a

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.720 
see the Strand and it does it has a
really<00:05:31.370> nice<00:05:31.520> anti<00:05:32.480> balance<00:05:32.900> yes<00:05:33.700> which<00:05:34.700> is

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
really nice anti balance yes which is
