 Clear that he would never see her again 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.439

 Owner of the DAX and we can spend so many months for years 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.259
 a talk but you're not preventing me 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.389
 and after three lists of played negotiators in the hip yes 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.719
 so one has basically made him permanent bad conscience to him that 

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.159
 Feeling that they are not, as it were, in accordance with the laws of the Koran 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.980
 Percent, of course, I also felt bad myself because I knew 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.019
 I'm somewhere to the north thanks to catchier 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.539

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.320
 Berliner Charité Kinder is a lawyer with us since 25 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.530
 Years ago she is engaged in human rights she says forced marriage 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.010
 is legal drives in the Baltics 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.190
 you can find that 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.120
 that's exactly what she wrote down at some point there is no 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.190
 back and she can not just say no, so not the partner 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 Percent we would like to intensify as he became her even when pushed around and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 Percent, they had no way out of this, especially 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.440
 the landlord I want 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.140
 from her practice then when she took over the story of Sabatina she 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.910
 the feeling 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.910
 that is a story the maximum sum just not every other day 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.430
 I heard this morning, I have a client myself 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.160
 how exactly have cause for the problems and who are now trying the series 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.300
 pick up and get out of it and it goes to German laws but 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.680
 It is new difficult, the country is direct 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 they feel like they are threatened so Napoli there are people who 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.670
 After a complete costume there are people who call you anonymous 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.580
 similar things 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.070
 So I've recently met a percent of safety people that me 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.780
 said 'if we lie in any situation in which I do not even 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.509
 go to my coffee house 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.490
 March is not just about a family to Sarah maybe meant 15 years ago 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.109
 It could not just be the act against the club 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.790
 embossed 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.510
 I got a girl out of an emergency situation before the forced marriage 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.640
 saved and where people now know that's our law you 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.670
 and last she was beaten up next to one 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.390
 Street and the Swedes obtains it is already a fear with which one lives 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.870
 and finally he is very sad that 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.710
 In Germany so life must be so careful among all guests 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.820

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.859
 Islam is or something 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.540
 There Nick Leeson stands the political will correctness over human rights 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.359

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.899
 I think we are too much 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:32.149

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.489
