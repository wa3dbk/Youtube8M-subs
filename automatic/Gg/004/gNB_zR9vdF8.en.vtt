00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.140
 you have to find 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.410
 I will not introduce myself 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:19.330
 john deere 72 15r bedside bay 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.330
 reserved exclusively for donors 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.000
 fashion is very well done very much 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 realistic indeed we can see with 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.830
 the b button the hood opens and closes 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.550
 with the n key instead the lift ad 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:48.430
 front breeders can close and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 open well insert into the tractor with 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.980
 the sic of control you can see that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.740
 I can raise or lower the lift 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.970
 back as I want it we get into 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.290
 cabin then these inner dreams made 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.100
 the doors are very well detailed 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 can be opened can be closed open the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 this is it here 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.740
 well 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.020
 with the psi trl key you can activate 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 disable double traction 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:40.890
 well now we put in motion we lower the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:46.100
 verb the steering wheel if we want some 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.100
 the artist is set in motion 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 well 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:05.749
 political effect key y instead 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.749
 deactivate the hand train 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.530
 with this 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:35.859
 champ of the key grip is active 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:39.099
 later these are four 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:43.030
 arrows say emergency 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:45.000
 these are the flashing lights this serves 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.760
 for double traction 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.849
 and then there would be different jobs 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.849
 front and rear 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:05.540
 here these would be normal lights and 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.540
 these would be good arrows 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.920
 the doors are 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.920
 as I have already said this all openable 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:31.320
 another special thing about an inverser 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.930
 that if you want to change the meaning of 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.200
 gear enough that allows the press the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.200
 z button 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.720
 sorry tailor hicks 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.800
 as you can see now I go to a father 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.430
 back supreme of marmagna yogurt 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.430
 forward 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.459
 well 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.530
 now let's try changing the tires 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.759
 here's to mount these tires 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:37.630
 the first tight tires we have to 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:41.740
 take the art button that's how 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.789
 you can see in the trivial about a text 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.160
 scenic doors those we had before 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.819
 now the john our south zone and how 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.819
 narrow 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.040
 let's try adding the others here 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.560
 Yup 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.370
 I ca n't mount them because they are too much 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.639
 neighbors however are more distant and 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.940
 it works we attach the charger 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.940
 front 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.189
 sorry if now the first little way 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.819
 realistic but sure to see how 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.819
 it works 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.440
 but 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.430
 I gave to those I love the ballast 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.800
 then there is a coach 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.180
 this is the taste here they are very beautiful 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.780
 a then later seeks out the 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.780
 supplement 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.330
 in this way 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.940
 well as of how it was I already said 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:22.139
 this is a very beautiful fashion made 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.970

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.060
