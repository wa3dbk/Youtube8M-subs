00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
end and that's where the angles gonna be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
end and that's where the angles gonna be
and<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:09.119> literally<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.510> gonna<00:01:09.869> start

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
end of the brow and then you can take a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
end of the brow and then you can take a
little<00:01:15.450> brush<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.229> over<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> angle<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
