the first the first to potentially have
liquid<00:02:29.480> oceans<00:02:29.770> perhaps<00:02:30.770> even<00:02:31.040> fish<00:02:31.520> perhaps

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
liquid oceans perhaps even fish perhaps

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.150

earth we don't know for sure but now

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.750 
earth we don't know for sure but now
this<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.680> holy<00:02:36.980> grail<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.460> astronomy

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
this is the holy grail of astronomy

this is the holy grail of astronomy
finding<00:02:38.570> an<00:02:38.660> earth-like<00:02:38.840> twin<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:40.070> where

finding an earth-like twin because where

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.450 
finding an earth-like twin because where
there's<00:02:40.520> water<00:02:41.110> there's<00:02:42.110> usually<00:02:42.440> life<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
there's water there's usually life the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.730 
there's water there's usually life the
detectives<00:02:44.150> say<00:02:44.390> follow<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.900> money<00:02:45.020> we

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
detectives say follow the money we

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.920 
detectives say follow the money we
scientists<00:02:46.310> say<00:02:46.460> follow<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.970> water<00:02:47.420> liquid

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
scientists say follow the water liquid

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
scientists say follow the water liquid
water<00:02:48.350> liquid<00:02:48.650> oceans<00:02:49.130> because<00:02:49.550> that's<00:02:49.760> where

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
water liquid oceans because that's where

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.990 
water liquid oceans because that's where
life<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.480> DNA<00:02:50.990> first<00:02:51.350> got<00:02:51.650> off<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.070> ground<00:02:52.280> so

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
life and DNA first got off the ground so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.900 
life and DNA first got off the ground so
if<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.330> planet<00:02:53.630> has<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.930> liquid<00:02:54.500> ocean

if this planet has a liquid ocean

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.940 
if this planet has a liquid ocean
chances<00:02:55.910> are<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.420> has<00:02:56.720> at<00:02:56.930> least<00:02:57.140> microbial

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
chances are it has at least microbial

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.950 
chances are it has at least microbial
life<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.610> who<00:02:58.790> knows<00:02:59.030> maybe<00:02:59.090> beyond<00:02:59.750> that

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
life and who knows maybe beyond that

somebody may be gazing back at us but

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.010 
somebody may be gazing back at us but
it's<00:03:13.070> not<00:03:13.220> going<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.460> be<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.610> two-way

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
it's not going to be a two-way

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.230 
it's not going to be a two-way
conversation<00:03:15.020> it's<00:03:15.170> not<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.440> et<00:03:15.890> phone<00:03:16.160> home

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
conversation it's not like et phone home

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.670 
conversation it's not like et phone home
it's<00:03:17.240> going<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.390> be<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> one-way<00:03:17.780> conversation

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's going to be a one-way conversation

eavesdropping on aliens from outer space

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.110 
eavesdropping on aliens from outer space
perhaps<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.830> even<00:03:22.130> if<00:03:22.250> we<00:03:22.400> were<00:03:22.550> able<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.880> send

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
perhaps so even if we were able to send

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270 
perhaps so even if we were able to send
a<00:03:23.210> signal<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.750> how<00:03:24.320> would<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.620> communicate

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
a signal I how would we communicate

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.710 
a signal I how would we communicate
that's<00:03:25.730> exactly<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.210> if<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.660> a

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
that's exactly right if you have a

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.480 
that's exactly right if you have a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
message in a bottle in the ocean you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.160 
message in a bottle in the ocean you
can't<00:03:28.730> communicate<00:03:28.940> back<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> people

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
can't communicate back to the people

can't communicate back to the people

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
send a message in a bottle right which

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.180 
send a message in a bottle right which
which<00:03:32.420> makes<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.870> seem<00:03:33.140> all<00:03:33.290> kind<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.710> kind<00:03:34.040> of

which makes it seem all kind of kind of
strange<00:03:34.460> good<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.120> understand<00:03:35.510> up<00:03:35.630> you

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
strange good I can understand up you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.200 
strange good I can understand up you
came<00:03:36.110> up<00:03:36.290> with<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> idea<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:37.220> got<00:03:37.760> under<00:03:37.970> said

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
came up with the idea I got under said

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.540 
came up with the idea I got under said
of<00:03:38.330> NASA<00:03:38.660> came<00:03:39.110> up<00:03:39.260> with<00:03:39.410> an<00:03:39.500> idea<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.160> what

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
of NASA came up with an idea and what

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.430 
of NASA came up with an idea and what
about<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.910> United<00:03:41.270> Nations<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.870> think<00:03:42.380> they

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
about the United Nations I think they

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.320 
about the United Nations I think they
want<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.680> stake<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.890> claim<00:03:43.100> because<00:03:43.970> right<00:03:44.300> now

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
want to stake a claim because right now

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.320 
want to stake a claim because right now
there<00:03:44.720> are<00:03:44.750> no<00:03:45.050> protocols<00:03:45.320> there's<00:03:46.310> no<00:03:46.610> way<00:03:47.270> to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
there are no protocols there's no way to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.690 
there are no protocols there's no way to
address<00:03:47.870> an<00:03:48.080> alien<00:03:48.620> ambassador<00:03:48.740> there's<00:03:49.550> no

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
address an alien ambassador there's no

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.690 
address an alien ambassador there's no
way<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.940> set<00:03:50.270> up<00:03:50.420> how<00:03:50.780> trade<00:03:51.200> would<00:03:51.440> be

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
way to set up how trade would be

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.830 
way to set up how trade would be
communications<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:52.940> information<00:03:53.330> will<00:03:53.810> be

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
communications and information will be

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.510 
communications and information will be
exchanged<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.740> I<00:03:54.770> think<00:03:54.890> they<00:03:55.130> want<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.370> like

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
exchanged so I think they want to like

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.640 
exchanged so I think they want to like
put<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.730> stake<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.600> in<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.959> ground<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.410> say

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
put a stake in the in the ground and say

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.920 
put a stake in the in the ground and say
we<00:03:58.100> claim<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.459> in<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.240> name<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.600> United

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
we claim this in the name of the United

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.480 
we claim this in the name of the United
Nation<00:04:00.260> now<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> know<00:04:00.650> there<00:04:00.920> are<00:04:00.980> others<00:04:01.310> who

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
Nation now I know there are others who
