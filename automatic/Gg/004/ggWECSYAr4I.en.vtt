00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.840
 winter sportsmen on the chest researchers left a hundred like a sausage 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.040
 to find out how it is that a dog is in his left 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
 park starts to run and finds 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 this expands its services 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 the relationship is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.989
 the consumer association is leaving 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.669
 a search 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.630
 command how it then performs the search for the experienced adults in the park 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.230
 with the consequences of the crisis 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.190
 there will be traffic and transportation or studying I have found 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 I have started researching the I have this one 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.859
 it works with the left side 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.170
 has been communicated to charity 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.660
 performance 8 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.520
 the foundation to be set 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.970
 he takes worse 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.100
 sit still 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 i had here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 how could it be that for a grant from stockholm is already such a sweet woman 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760
 people we are way too early for babel 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.010
 in the way not to stassen out 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.810
 all this has to do with the social charges with the delay of the petition 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.189
 most this time powers on the morning are not conceivable 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.159
 fc basel 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.780
 every night 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.700
 achieved technical condition of the vehicles 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 so hence 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.610
 a search meter 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 the Dutchman set that time but then 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 the dog is blindfolded very essential 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.970
 That became clear when I first noticed the front legs were clearly able 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.860
 see it is purely information that is upside down and waiting 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.960
 the people walk with the nose care that time 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.510
 on the track you can also regularly see their nose for tasting 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.320
 whatever the information comes in figures made they know 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.720
 That is also exactly you can see that does not have to offer more information 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.409
 more than a hundred in total 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.080
 Sunday we had all those images of the dogs that were good to have 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.570
 through our recession 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.970
 other times and then have the computer 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.940
 let the statisticians perform processing in the interpretation of it 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.919
 see that result 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.889
 a good performance 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 is a performance not so good 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.009
 we have investigated this kind and discussed it with a number of psychologists 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.189
 scientists and they could explain this differently 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.829
 although of course you don't know for sure 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.660
 and one based on an investigation that has been done 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.109
 a year earlier 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.239
 the right hemisphere is known as dots 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.829
 vumc is connected to 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.059
 behavior 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.979
 sent what you mean by routine if you feel comfortable even though skaters are allowed 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:45.749
 up again 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.219
 while the left hemisphere is used to respect and you do that 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.969
 typically at the moment that thing is not going so well with the left hemisphere that is 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.339
 linked 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.429
 However for tackle it could be that you are indeed no longer precise 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.499
 at least you can do the same 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:06.829
 monti is forced to turn blind and gets turned over 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.719
 and otherwise not the road 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.480
 do all other things instead of the children's shoes
