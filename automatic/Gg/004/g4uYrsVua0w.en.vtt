00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.460
 video lesson today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 thank you very much for the comments of the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.530
 videos that we are happy because 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.770
 gives a net job of recording video from 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.840
 Armadillo alone and I'm really grateful 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.170
 that my 20 are helping you and me 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.300
 I decided I'm doing video lesson here and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.029
 organize a little channel is not to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.609
 to be very messy like this, then I go 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 so try to type when you went 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.809
 untapped and I'm going to make a movie a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.719
 turned only in video only that is more 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.489
 easy catch even is speaking hi 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.719
 lots of people asking me 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.719
 turn of this song here 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.980
 [Music] 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.980
 climbs up 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.859
 [Music] 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:03.449
 then this turn I used think 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.390
 I 'm not mistaken 3.250 or so video 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.729
 Thank God it's a turn I do not know. 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 to pronounce a certain turn then 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.759
 coast shop so I do not know if this test 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.000
 is correct and is a kind of turn and funk 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.670
 american sims bless and I really like the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.280
 It leads because we are really pretty 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 even it 's not hard not it's very 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.270
 Difficult that can divide you understand 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
 what if the person is doing more 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.720
 I later understood that this is the only thing 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 the world's easiest behind the turn 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 I will not show it to you either. 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.920
 first turn of 3 50 because the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.289
 I'm going to buy some kind of complicated sale. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.960
 say more or less the introduction as 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.909
 You make that kind of joke, so let's go. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.250
 see how it's the turn that I'm going to show 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:02:05.909
 For you today, what would she look like? 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:02:05.909
 [Music] 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.700
 so as you saw the turn I 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.770
 I'll be going through slow motion like 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:37.500
 Are you going to do it then are not you? 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:39.780
 A little slower if the turn is you. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.880
 will start first chimbau have everything 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.880
 stock everything the story will book 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.340
 two touch with a world 2 of a cup 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.870
 bunch you will distribute I see is 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.680
 I started filming the tour through 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.420
 box then in a later you will see that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.019
 you have turned to a girl as well 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.019
 slowly 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.589
 [Music] 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.780
 [Music] 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.460
 I would like to spend this first 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.950
 facing you 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:28.800
 and as he goes according to plan, if you 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.340
 does not give me this turn that first 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.620
 As I'm still posting more video 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.500
 until reaching that of 3 50 or so 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.020
 So everybody's asking and that's it. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.490
 study also saw why battery is a 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.110
 thing that requires a lot of study is a 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.030
 instrument you have to have technicians 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.250
 have to have speed resistance then 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 It's kind of complicated, unfortunately. 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 It is also one of the a case of asking 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:03.800
 I really liked it , I liked it.
