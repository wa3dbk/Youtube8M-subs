00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
should pointless because it just makes

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.680 
should pointless because it just makes
the<00:00:43.170> series<00:00:43.410> longer<00:00:43.649> than<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
the series longer than it has to be and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
the series longer than it has to be and
because<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> there's<00:00:46.170> no<00:00:46.260> difference<00:00:46.590> if

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
because for you there's no difference if

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.799 
because for you there's no difference if
i<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.219> in-form<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.539> kind<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
i get an in-form or not so it's kind of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
i get an in-form or not so it's kind of
a<00:00:48.930> waste<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> time<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.789> but<00:00:50.789> yeah<00:00:50.879> that's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a waste of time really but yeah that's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.470 
a waste of time really but yeah that's
the<00:00:51.210> whole<00:00:51.629> idea<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> series<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> i<00:00:53.480> was

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the whole idea of the series and i was

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.580 
the whole idea of the series and i was
thinking<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.809> terms<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.320> i<00:00:55.350> could<00:00:55.440> do

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thinking in terms of what i could do

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
thinking in terms of what i could do
this<00:00:55.739> yours<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> make<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.489> fun<00:00:56.789> little

and<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.860> come<00:02:28.980> across<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.400> which<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.849> its

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and we come across this which is its

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.930 
and we come across this which is its
word<00:02:30.599> because<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.379> inexpensive<00:02:31.769> all<00:02:32.760> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
word because it's inexpensive all you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.190 
word because it's inexpensive all you
seen<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.420> isn't<00:02:33.690> because<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.079> know

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
seen but it isn't because you know

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
seen but it isn't because you know
you've<00:02:34.349> got<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.650> example<00:02:34.980> javi<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.670> any<00:02:35.819> sto

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you've got for example javi and any sto

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.850 
you've got for example javi and any sto
expensive<00:02:36.569> players<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:37.590> you've<00:02:37.709> got

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
expensive players but then you've got

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.039 
expensive players but then you've got
for<00:02:37.980> example<00:02:38.310> pool<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:39.360> run<00:02:39.569> from<00:02:39.810> who

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
for example pool and you run from who

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.839 
for example pool and you run from who
are<00:02:40.170> very<00:02:40.470> very<00:02:40.769> cheap<00:02:41.010> players<00:02:41.280> which<00:02:41.489> it

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
are very very cheap players which it

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.039 
are very very cheap players which it
doesn't<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.150> make<00:02:42.329> sense<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.750> could<00:02:42.930> have

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
doesn't really make sense you could have

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.990 
doesn't really make sense you could have
gone<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.409> better<00:02:43.590> overall<00:02:43.980> team<00:02:44.220> rather

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
gone for a better overall team rather

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.009 
gone for a better overall team rather
than<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.239> having<00:02:45.390> good<00:02:45.569> in<00:02:45.689> certain<00:02:45.930> areas

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
than just having good in certain areas

and<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.500> think<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.830> will<00:04:32.949> be<00:04:33.030> something<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.180> bit

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and I think it will be something a bit

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.230 
and I think it will be something a bit
fresh<00:04:34.539> to<00:04:34.720> do<00:04:34.840> after<00:04:35.259> my<00:04:35.849> rep<00:04:36.849> Chelsea

fresh to do after my rep Chelsea
seriously<00:04:37.870> that's<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.289> set<00:04:39.009> series<00:04:39.340> that<00:04:39.490> you

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
seriously that's a set series that you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.399 
seriously that's a set series that you
can't<00:04:39.789> keep<00:04:39.909> going<00:04:40.150> forever<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:41.169> obviously

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
can't keep going forever and obviously

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.770 
can't keep going forever and obviously
it's<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.740> run<00:04:41.919> at<00:04:42.039> some<00:04:42.190> point<00:04:42.569> and<00:04:43.569> but

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
it's going to run at some point and but

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.270 
it's going to run at some point and but
it'll<00:04:43.900> be<00:04:43.930> something<00:04:44.169> nice<00:04:44.349> to<00:04:44.530> do<00:04:44.680> after<00:04:45.190> I've

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280

not even half time we've got bangles
each<00:05:35.349> Cavani<00:05:35.949> with<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.430> penalty<00:05:36.909> puts<00:05:37.330> in<00:05:37.449> the

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
each Cavani with the penalty puts in the

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.809 
each Cavani with the penalty puts in the
back<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.750> net<00:05:37.900> anyway<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:39.340> that's<00:05:39.460> why<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.699> went

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
back the net anyway so that's why I went

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.390 
back the net anyway so that's why I went
from<00:05:39.940> 500<00:05:40.419> coins<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:41.349> about<00:05:41.530> 20<00:05:41.889> k<00:05:42.069> because

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
from 500 coins to about 20 k because

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.640 
from 500 coins to about 20 k because
without<00:05:43.180> remaining<00:05:43.509> like<00:05:43.630> 20k<00:05:43.900> I<00:05:44.050> made<00:05:44.349> a<00:05:44.380> team

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
without remaining like 20k I made a team

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.800 
without remaining like 20k I made a team
and<00:05:44.889> that's<00:05:45.219> why<00:05:45.699> was<00:05:46.000> at<00:05:46.090> about<00:05:46.270> 20k<00:05:46.599> for<00:05:46.630> a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
and that's why was at about 20k for a

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.950 
and that's why was at about 20k for a
team<00:05:47.020> in<00:05:47.259> this<00:05:47.440> series<00:05:47.710> and<00:05:48.690> but<00:05:49.690> looking
