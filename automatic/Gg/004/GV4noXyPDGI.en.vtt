to just apply red on my lid I just

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890 
to just apply red on my lid I just
wanted<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.509> be<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> very<00:01:08.070> soft<00:01:08.900> red

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
if that makes sense I don't know so I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
if that makes sense I don't know so I
just<00:01:12.299> felt<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.049> needed<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.590> incorporate

just felt like I needed to incorporate

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.599 
just felt like I needed to incorporate
some<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.329> into<00:01:15.749> this<00:01:15.899> look<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.859> of<00:01:17.009> course<00:01:17.280> I

some right into this look so of course I

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.550 
some right into this look so of course I
kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.999> overdid<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.539> so<00:01:18.749> I'm<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:19.079> on<00:01:19.200> back

kind of overdid it so I'm going on back

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.349 
kind of overdid it so I'm going on back

this<00:02:27.820> from<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> beginning<00:02:28.540> because

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
this from the beginning because

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.160 
this from the beginning because
obviously<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.800> can't<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.790> sharp<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.720> line

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.750 
obviously I can't get as sharp as a line
with<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.700> pencil<00:02:34.360> then<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.230> could<00:02:35.590> with<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.220> brush

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
with a pencil then I could with a brush

crisp<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:57.640> guess<00:03:58.030> cleaner<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.750> then

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
crisp and just I guess cleaner and then

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.900 
crisp and just I guess cleaner and then
to<00:03:59.019> my<00:03:59.140> lower<00:03:59.440> outer<00:03:59.860> lash<00:04:00.370> line<00:04:00.640> I'm<00:04:00.880> just

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to my lower outer lash line I'm just

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.540 
to my lower outer lash line I'm just
applying<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.959> dark<00:04:02.410> matte<00:04:02.800> color<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.340> same

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
applying a dark matte color the same

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.180 
applying a dark matte color the same
color<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.060> used<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.569> deepen<00:04:05.470> up<00:04:05.650> my<00:04:05.860> crease

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
color that I used to deepen up my crease

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.140 
color that I used to deepen up my crease
and<00:04:06.489> this<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:06.819> just<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.150> add<00:04:07.299> some<00:04:07.780> depth<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
and this is just to add some depth and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.580 
and this is just to add some depth and
of<00:04:10.150> course<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.720> look<00:04:10.989> wouldn't<00:04:11.500> be

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
of course this look wouldn't be

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.699 
of course this look wouldn't be
completed<00:04:12.220> without<00:04:12.670> some<00:04:13.510> false<00:04:13.810> lashes<00:04:13.989> I'm

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
completed without some false lashes I'm

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.250 
completed without some false lashes I'm
just<00:04:15.400> using<00:04:15.640> corner<00:04:16.120> lashes<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:16.750> look<00:04:16.870> I

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
just using corner lashes for this look I

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.740 
just using corner lashes for this look I
actually<00:04:17.380> prefer<00:04:18.070> corner<00:04:18.549> lashes<00:04:18.760> because

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
actually prefer corner lashes because

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.420 
actually prefer corner lashes because
they're<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> little<00:04:20.290> bit<00:04:20.470> more<00:04:20.500> simple<00:04:20.950> plus

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
they're a little bit more simple plus

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.750 
they're a little bit more simple plus
they<00:04:22.090> still<00:04:22.540> add<00:04:22.810> something<00:04:23.530> very<00:04:24.010> special<00:04:24.400> to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
they still add something very special to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.629 
they still add something very special to
your<00:04:24.820> eyes<00:04:25.000> they<00:04:25.360> change<00:04:25.780> your<00:04:26.410> shape<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:27.220> I

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
your eyes they change your shape and I

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.730

so<00:04:29.950> now<00:04:30.070> I'm<00:04:30.130> going<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> be<00:04:30.639> moving<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.210> my

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
so now I'm going to be moving on to my

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.920 
so now I'm going to be moving on to my
face<00:04:31.630> I'm<00:04:31.870> taking<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.590> matte<00:04:32.889> blush<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.930> in

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.770 
face I'm taking a matte blush and in
this<00:04:35.889> really<00:04:36.310> nice<00:04:36.550> contour<00:04:37.090> brush<00:04:37.330> that

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
this really nice contour brush that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.290 
this really nice contour brush that
makes<00:04:38.470> contouring<00:04:39.340> your<00:04:39.490> face<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.120> much

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
makes contouring your face so much

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.300 
makes contouring your face so much
easier<00:04:40.690> because<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.530> shape<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.010> brush

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
easier because of the shape of the brush

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.240 
easier because of the shape of the brush
how<00:04:42.639> it's<00:04:42.850> pinched<00:04:43.450> but<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.260> obviously<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:45.010> don't

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
how it's pinched but I obviously I don't

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.830 
how it's pinched but I obviously I don't
want<00:04:45.550> any<00:04:45.760> harsh<00:04:46.000> lines<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.450> I'm<00:04:46.510> just<00:04:46.690> gonna

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
want any harsh lines so I'm just gonna

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.770

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
hairline and this is going to make a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.159 
hairline and this is going to make a
head<00:05:01.960> shape<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.830> guess<00:05:03.070> or<00:05:03.400> my<00:05:03.850> face<00:05:04.690> look<00:05:05.050> a
