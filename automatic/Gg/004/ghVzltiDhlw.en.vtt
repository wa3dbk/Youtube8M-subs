00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm Dietrich Kissel, 53 years old,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.800
with more than 42 years experience in motor sport.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.320
I'm extremely happy that I still can drive with the original...

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.200
...group 2 Golf from the year '82. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000
I come from a family of motor sport enthusiasts...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
...and we are devoted to motoring ever since…

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.800
...and I'm a child of VW and simply love my Golf.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.040
Now, here in the group 2 Golf it was a revolution.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.360
One simply has left-off everything which wasn’t needed.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.240
There wasn’t a dash-board; we only needed the instrument panel...

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.200
...which was quite austere placed here on top,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.400
so that the driver was able to have it in a good viewing position.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.200
Here, one still realises the power and the purity belonging to motoring...

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.400
or to the car, which one essentially needs.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.200
The powerful 160 HP 1.6 litre motor

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.600
One hears it roar and it's speeding when the 160 horses are let loose.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
Great!
