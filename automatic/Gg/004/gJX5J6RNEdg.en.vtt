touch<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.700> also<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.000> higher<00:01:27.210> object

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
touch and you also get higher object

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
touch and you also get higher object
density<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:29.009> immersive<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.759> richer

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
density for a more immersive and richer

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.819 
density for a more immersive and richer
environment<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.380> comes<00:01:31.409> with

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
environment and that all comes with

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.469 
environment and that all comes with
increased<00:01:32.220> geometry<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.970> everything<00:01:33.329> is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
increased geometry so everything is

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.490 
increased geometry so everything is
smoother<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.110> crisp

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.660 

so<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.620> was<00:01:37.710> quick<00:01:37.920> look<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.280> ARMA<00:01:38.550> tactics

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so that was quick look at ARMA tactics
