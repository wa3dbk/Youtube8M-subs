okay<00:00:00.359> now<00:00:00.570> we'll<00:00:00.690> try<00:00:00.810> seed<00:00:01.140> you<00:00:01.319> offset

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
okay now we'll try seed you offset

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.200

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
usually use a universal bullseye that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
usually use a universal bullseye that
all<00:00:33.600> allied<00:00:34.050> aircraft<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.770> where<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.190> as

all allied aircraft know where it is as

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that fixed point this is what we'll use

that fixed point this is what we'll use
to<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.520> probably<00:00:38.820> use<00:00:39.059> most<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to do in what you probably use most in

dcs<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> bullseye<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.579> we'll<00:00:41.760> use

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
dcs this is the bullseye what we'll use

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.030 
dcs this is the bullseye what we'll use
to<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:42.989> I'd<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> imagine<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to do now I'd like you to imagine the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.440 
to do now I'd like you to imagine the
points<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> compass<00:00:44.700> coming<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
points of the compass coming out of it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.520 
points of the compass coming out of it
so<00:00:45.899> north<00:00:46.440> east<00:00:47.329> south<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> west

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so north east south and west

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
so north east south and west
so<00:00:50.309> that's<00:00:50.460> 360<00:00:51.170> 90<00:00:52.190> 180<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.579> 270<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so that's 360 90 180 and 270 and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.340 
so that's 360 90 180 and 270 and
everything<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.260> between<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.620> 45<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.350> now

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
everything in between so 45 you know now

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
everything in between so 45 you know now
say<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.770> an<00:00:58.829> allied<00:00:59.129> aircraft<00:00:59.340> found

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
say that an allied aircraft found

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.660 
say that an allied aircraft found
targets<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.770> that<00:01:01.770> aircraft<00:01:01.980> would<00:01:02.520> take

targets here that aircraft would take

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
targets here that aircraft would take
the<00:01:02.820> bearing<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> distance<00:01:03.660> from<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> bull's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the bearing and distance from the bull's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.450 
the bearing and distance from the bull's
eye<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.309> 57<00:01:05.970> degrees<00:01:08.630> for<00:01:09.630> 5.7<00:01:10.590> kilometers<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
eye so 57 degrees for 5.7 kilometers and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
eye so 57 degrees for 5.7 kilometers and
announce<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> radio<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:16.040> then

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
announce it over the radio to you then

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
announce it over the radio to you then
you<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.310> find<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.640> bullseye<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.090> follow

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you would find the bullseye and follow

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.969 
you would find the bullseye and follow
the<00:01:18.720> bearing<00:01:19.110> he<00:01:19.290> gave<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:21.470> for<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> distance

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the bearing he gave you for the distance

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:40.130 
the bearing he gave you for the distance
he<00:01:23.100> gave<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.790> find<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.150> target

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
this Waypoint you first have to switch

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:24.210 
this Waypoint you first have to switch
the<00:05:16.080> steer<00:05:16.350> point<00:05:16.620> dial<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.190> Mission

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.340 

then<00:05:24.850> cycle<00:05:25.300> your<00:05:25.480> steer<00:05:25.720> point<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.230> the

the Waypoint the offset method only

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.450 
the Waypoint the offset method only
comes<00:05:53.080> up<00:05:53.290> with<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.620> general<00:05:53.800> area<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:54.400> the

comes up with the general area of the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.340 
comes up with the general area of the
target<00:05:54.970> so<00:05:55.480> you<00:05:55.540> will<00:05:55.750> have<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:56.020> search<00:05:56.230> a

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
target so you will have to search a

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.280 
target so you will have to search a
little<00:05:56.880> turn<00:05:57.880> in<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.090> pod<00:05:58.270> on<00:05:58.300> IR<00:05:58.870> so<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.140> can

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
little turn in the pod on IR so you can

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:10.500 
little turn in the pod on IR so you can
see<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.560> better

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:21.999 

ah<00:06:10.960> there<00:06:11.590> we<00:06:11.680> go

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.809 

you<00:06:22.550> can<00:06:22.729> learn<00:06:22.879> engage<00:06:23.270> targets
