the bow so it's 2,500 of your points to
upgrade<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.930> bow<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.770> worth<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
upgrade the bow which is worth it and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.810 
upgrade the bow which is worth it and
once<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> upgrade<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.570> once<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.170> maxed<00:00:46.649> out

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
once you upgrade it once it's maxed out

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.220 
once you upgrade it once it's maxed out
you<00:00:47.820> might<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.030> well<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:48.780> because

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you might as well just do it now because

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.529 
you might as well just do it now because
you're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.680> using<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> boat

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
you're going to be using the boat

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.910 
you're going to be using the boat
throughout<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> year<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> one's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.310 

it's<00:00:57.460> really<00:00:57.879> easy<00:00:58.210> it's<00:00:58.510> just<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.899> matter<00:00:59.199> of

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
it's really easy it's just a matter of

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.900 
it's really easy it's just a matter of
patience<00:00:59.829> it's<00:01:00.280> weird<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.609> there's<00:01:00.820> only

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
patience it's weird that there's only

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.899 
patience it's weird that there's only
one<00:01:01.629> level<00:01:02.109> of<00:01:02.260> bow<00:01:02.649> available<00:01:03.609> because<00:01:03.699> that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
one level of bow available because that

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.899 
one level of bow available because that
will<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.659> five<00:01:04.900> levels<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.409> his<00:01:05.560> chains

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
will and like five levels of his chains

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.490 
will and like five levels of his chains
well<00:01:06.909> actually<00:01:07.540> I<00:01:07.840> shouldn't<00:01:08.049> say<00:01:08.200> that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
well actually I shouldn't say that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.499 
well actually I shouldn't say that
because<00:01:08.649> I've<00:01:08.890> played<00:01:09.189> this<00:01:09.340> yet<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:09.880> in

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
because I've played this yet but in

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.090 
because I've played this yet but in
previous<00:01:10.960> games<00:01:11.080> like<00:01:11.320> every<00:01:11.619> weapon<00:01:11.770> had<00:01:12.040> a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
previous games like every weapon had a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.070 
previous games like every weapon had a
couple<00:01:12.310> levels<00:01:12.520> maybe<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.479> was<00:01:13.630> hard<00:01:13.840> that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
couple levels maybe that was hard that

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.990 
couple levels maybe that was hard that
was<00:01:14.229> quiet<00:01:14.860> it's<00:01:15.190> harder<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.490> max<00:01:15.820> out

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
was quiet it's harder to max out

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.710 
was quiet it's harder to max out
everything<00:01:16.479> hmm<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.250> once<00:01:18.970> he<00:01:19.060> grabs<00:01:19.509> the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
everything hmm so once he grabs the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.499 
everything hmm so once he grabs the
ceiling<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.320> comes<00:01:20.560> down<00:01:20.799> that<00:01:21.610> means<00:01:21.789> his

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
ceiling and comes down that means his

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.210 
ceiling and comes down that means his
new<00:01:22.810> league's<00:01:23.049> got<00:01:23.200> new<00:01:23.350> attacks<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:23.979> he's<00:01:24.070> got

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220

you're<00:06:39.949> doing<00:06:40.189> a<00:06:40.249> boner<00:06:40.459> I<00:06:41.259> don't<00:06:42.259> know<00:06:42.319> oh

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:42.559 
you're doing a boner I don't know oh

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.769 
you're doing a boner I don't know oh
well<00:06:43.489> because<00:06:43.699> you<00:06:43.819> have<00:06:43.969> pull<00:06:44.239> the<00:06:44.479> starter

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
well because you have pull the starter

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.569 
well because you have pull the starter
this<00:06:44.899> maybe<00:06:45.169> you<00:06:45.319> could<00:06:45.529> use<00:06:45.859> that<00:06:46.099> at<00:06:46.459> the

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:46.579 
this maybe you could use that at the

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:48.849 
this maybe you could use that at the
very<00:06:46.609> beginning<00:06:46.909> and<00:06:47.329> then<00:06:47.449> I've<00:06:48.379> completely

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:48.859 
very beginning and then I've completely

00:06:48.859 --> 00:06:51.609 
very beginning and then I've completely
regenerated<00:06:49.489> it<00:06:49.669> by<00:06:49.789> the<00:06:49.849> end<00:06:49.969> uh-huh<00:06:50.569> I<00:06:51.139> don't

00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:51.619 
regenerated it by the end uh-huh I don't

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.439 
regenerated it by the end uh-huh I don't
think<00:06:51.769> it<00:06:51.859> regenerates<00:06:52.309> that<00:06:52.489> fast<00:06:52.789> but<00:06:53.149> oh

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
think it regenerates that fast but oh

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.599 
think it regenerates that fast but oh
well<00:06:54.169> that<00:06:54.379> is<00:06:54.409> really<00:06:54.769> play<00:06:55.009> around<00:06:55.039> with

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:55.609 
well that is really play around with

00:06:55.609 --> 00:07:00.869 
well that is really play around with
Poland<00:06:55.969> early<00:06:56.209> so<00:06:56.419> maybe<00:06:56.629> would<00:06:56.959> you<00:06:57.349> know

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.609 

yeah<00:07:01.879> so<00:07:02.239> I<00:07:02.449> I<00:07:02.539> believe<00:07:03.109> that<00:07:03.139> there's<00:07:03.559> a

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:03.619 
yeah so I I believe that there's a

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:06.699 
yeah so I I believe that there's a
checkpoint<00:07:04.149> after<00:07:05.149> this<00:07:05.359> I'm<00:07:06.349> not<00:07:06.499> a<00:07:06.529> hundred

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:06.709 
checkpoint after this I'm not a hundred

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:08.589 
checkpoint after this I'm not a hundred
percent<00:07:06.889> tricks<00:07:07.369> I<00:07:07.549> didn't<00:07:07.789> die<00:07:08.029> right<00:07:08.389> after

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 
percent tricks I didn't die right after

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:11.319 
percent tricks I didn't die right after
this<00:07:09.049> I<00:07:09.259> think<00:07:09.769> just<00:07:10.009> a<00:07:10.039> checkpoint<00:07:10.429> right

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:11.329 
this I think just a checkpoint right

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:14.469 
this I think just a checkpoint right
after<00:07:11.629> this<00:07:11.749> part<00:07:11.989> I<00:07:12.139> would<00:07:12.319> hope<00:07:12.439> so
