00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.680
 Ladies and gentlemen, Good evening 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.540
 I have the honor to address you this evening, which marks the end of a chapter of our lives and the beginning of another chapter. 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.220
 I would like to invite everyone to a moment of thought about the beginning of your adventure here in Israel. 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.340
 Do you remember receiving a letter of acceptance to the university? 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.440
 Perhaps you were enraged about reaching this country. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.160
 And then you started telling everyone that you would go to Israel, and perhaps you were upset 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.300
 Everyone in this room heard their friends or family members say to them, "Do not travel to Israel!" "There is conflict!" 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 "Do not be afraid of terrorist bombings?" 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.526
 "Do Jews speak English?" 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 "Do they have water?" 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.880
 If you think that you have heard many reasons not to travel to Israel, I have heard a million and a half. 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.160
 I grew up in Egypt and everyone in my country had ideas about Israel, all of which were negative. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 We only learned that there were 4 tough wars with them, and they are not like us. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.480
 For the first time, Israel was exposed to music and television. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.240
 On the radio, we heard songs about the devastation caused by Israel. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.140
 In the films the Israelis were spies and thieves. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:31.360
 Although the two countries signed a landmark peace treaty in 1979, they told me that the Israelis were our permanent enemies. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.800
 A new successful Egyptian film called "The cousins" spoke of an Israeli spy who married an Egyptian woman and had children 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.680
 The father then kidnapped the children and returned to Israel. 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.900
 So, when I told my mother that I meant to travel to Israel and study there, she was very frightened of my chance to meet a friend in Israel. 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 I came to Israel and I know what I saw in films and media only 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.780
 So at the airport, when the security officer asked me why I was going to Israel, I said, laughing: 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.160
 "I have always heard that the Jews are evil and I came to see it with my own eyes" 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 I expected to meet with people who were unfriendly and unfriendly to meet the Egyptians, but I was surprised when I learned the opposite. 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.060
 My friends invited me everywhere: Saturday dinners, breakfast dinners, and political meetings. 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.580
 The diversity found here surprised me just as the warmth of the people surprised me. 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:43.340
 On my first day at university I saw men wearing kipa, women wearing headscarves, and soldiers walking safely among the students. 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.520
 I learned that there were people of all kinds at the university, and the university was open to everyone 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.660
 Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, Bedouin and international students. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.360
 I learned that the diversity of the university is reflected in the diversity of Tel Aviv as well. 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.820
 It's very fun: you live in Tel Aviv and you go to the beach in the city center 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.460
 You can see a Muslim woman, a pair of homosexuals, and a Jew, Kharidi, all of whom share the same small status. 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.460
 Where can you see a Christian Arab whose apartment is decorated with posters for Mao and Lenin? 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.120
 Where can you see a Bedouin soldier from the IDF reading the Holy Quran on the train during the holy month of Ramadan? 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.080
 Where can you see Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews arguing over the kidnapping of Yemeni Jewish children in the 1950s? 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.940
 Certainly, my adventure here is determined by the unexpected. 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:47.600
 When you travel beyond Tel Aviv, it is impossible to ignore the proximity of the kibbutzim and the Arab villages, and the simple relations that the population has with one another. 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:58.720
 Perhaps the greatest finding I have found here is that, despite conflicting dates and identities, people are able to live in a cooperative environment. 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.500
 When I think about the paradox that exists in Israel on a daily basis, I remember at a specific moment: 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:17.780
 On my first day at the university, I was greeted by a nice Israeli Arab student who spoke to me about the importance of the Arab boycott of Israel. 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.800
 When her speech was over, a Jewish child approached us at the age of about eight, and was too excited to see her. 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.760
 It turned out that the student was his teacher! Then she hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.040
 Their love for some was like love among brothers. 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.620
 I have seen her great love for a child and her child's love too 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.380
 No matter how deep the conflict is, the human side always wins. 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:02.900
 I sometimes think it strange that the people of this country, whom I knew to be my enemies, have turned to my teachers, colleagues, doctors, shopkeepers and mentors. 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.040
 When the Israelis ask me, "What do you feel in this country?" I tell them quite frankly: "Before I knew you I did not love you!" 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.180
 I never thought that my enemies would accept me for their schools, their country, and even their community! 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.220
 At the end of my adventure, one of the big surprises did not come from Israel, but from Egypt: 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:33.640
 Every year during the holy month of Ramadan broadcasts television series seen by families from all over the Arab world after breakfast. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:43.060
 This year he broadcast a series called "The Jewish Quarter" which spoke about the story of Egyptian Jews during the first years of the establishment of the State of Israel. 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:52.900
 The series raises questions about identity and politics, and its staff consists of Muslim and Jewish actors. The series also has a romantic relationship between followers of both faiths. 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.920
 As a student of history, I can not say that the series is perfect 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:06.480
 But showing the Jews for the first time as humans, swarming with love for their country and their families, and not in the form of the arch enemy, was exceptional and very wonderful. 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:16.200
 Although Egypt has a long way to go before accepting Israel as its friend, this series can affect the Egyptians and make them think little before they determine the identity of their enemy. 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:23.700
 After a year of surprises without number I understood there was a lesson in all of this, which I think we all need to study. 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:33.980
 I think that as Master's students, and as people who seek to understand the world accurately, we must always question our assumptions. 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:44.640
 Staying in Israel taught me that life is full of paradoxes and complexities, that there are no simple things, and that the world is usually not at first. 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.340
 Despite our teaching and experience, we must dig deeper and deeper. 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.440
 Today, as we celebrate the end of a wonderful year, we must also mention the endeavors to go forward 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.340
 And to know that what we have to expect from life is that our life challenges our expectations. 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.380
 Thanks
