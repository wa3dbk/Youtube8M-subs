recording with the next f3 right now so
this<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.530> two-part<00:01:12.860> I'm<00:01:13.040> doing<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.310> test<00:01:13.550> on

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
this is a two-part I'm doing the test on

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.970 
this is a two-part I'm doing the test on
the<00:01:13.970> next<00:01:14.690> f3<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.200> see<00:01:15.350> how<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.560> works<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.920> the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
the next f3 to see how it works I the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.500 
the next f3 to see how it works I the
screen<00:01:16.340> flipped<00:01:16.640> up<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.000> can<00:01:17.180> actually<00:01:17.330> see

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
screen flipped up so I can actually see

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.230 
screen flipped up so I can actually see
myself<00:01:17.870> in<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.160> screen<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.880> might<00:01:20.060> notice

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
myself in the screen so you might notice

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.240 
myself in the screen so you might notice
I'm<00:01:20.780> not<00:01:21.050> looking<00:01:21.380> at<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.620> camera<00:01:21.800> I'm

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
I'm not looking at the camera I'm

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.670 
I'm not looking at the camera I'm
looking<00:01:22.910> just<00:01:23.270> past<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.840> camera<00:01:24.230> and<00:01:24.440> at

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
looking just past the camera and at

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.710 
looking just past the camera and at
myself<00:01:25.280> right<00:01:25.550> now<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.510> face

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
myself right now and the face

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.810 
myself right now and the face
recognition<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.740> could<00:01:28.010> see<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.310> on<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.550> screen

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
recognition I could see it on the screen

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.060 
recognition I could see it on the screen
so<00:01:28.850> it's<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.930> focus<00:01:30.290> should<00:01:30.440> be<00:01:30.470> right<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.770> my

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
so it's the focus should be right on my

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.880 
so it's the focus should be right on my
face<00:01:31.250> when<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:31.909> put<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.330> up<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.900> should<00:01:33.620> block

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
face when I put this up it should block

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.560 
face when I put this up it should block
my<00:01:34.159> face<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.790> focus<00:01:35.150> should<00:01:35.330> take

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
my face and the focus should take

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.230 
my face and the focus should take
priority<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.290> go<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:38.030> looks

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
priority and go to this and it looks

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.720 
priority and go to this and it looks
like<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.570> is<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.200> awesome<00:01:39.830> so<00:01:40.580> this

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
like it is which is awesome so this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.490 
like it is which is awesome so this
really<00:01:40.909> does<00:01:41.030> work<00:01:41.210> good<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:41.630> recording<00:01:42.260> I

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
really does work good for recording I

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.960 
really does work good for recording I
also<00:01:42.860> have<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.490> ECM<00:01:44.450> SST<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.800> compact<00:01:46.460> stereo

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
also have the ECM SST one compact stereo

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.920 
also have the ECM SST one compact stereo
mic<00:01:47.240> plugged<00:01:47.630> into<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.080> hot<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.530> hot<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
mic plugged into the hot the hot to the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.380 
mic plugged into the hot the hot to the
axillary<00:01:50.930> port<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.979> next<00:01:52.250> f3<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
axillary port on the next f3 so the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.000 
axillary port on the next f3 so the
audio<00:01:53.690> should<00:01:53.960> be<00:01:54.020> significantly<00:01:54.590> better<00:01:54.800> as

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
audio should be significantly better as

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.480 
audio should be significantly better as
well

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
well

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.880 
well
we'll<00:01:56.030> see<00:01:56.180> about<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.440> audio<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:57.830> not

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
we'll see about that the audio is not

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.370 
we'll see about that the audio is not
that<00:01:58.190> great<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.270> next<00:01:59.659> cameras<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.350> know

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
that great on the next cameras you know

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.200 
that great on the next cameras you know
just<00:02:00.680> right<00:02:00.890> off<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.159> camera<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:01.820> not<00:02:01.940> bad

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
just right off the camera it's not bad

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.450 
just right off the camera it's not bad
but<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.870> know<00:02:03.290> it's<00:02:03.830> not<00:02:03.950> like<00:02:04.010> an

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
but you know it's not like an

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.550 
but you know it's not like an
aftermarket<00:02:05.060> hotshoe<00:02:05.840> type

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
aftermarket hotshoe type

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.969 
aftermarket hotshoe type
adapter<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.239> would<00:02:09.200> assume<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.619> audio<00:02:09.890> will

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
adapter so I would assume the audio will

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.250 
adapter so I would assume the audio will
be<00:02:10.099> significantly<00:02:10.610> better<00:02:10.789> will<00:02:11.030> sit<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:12.110> any

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
be significantly better will sit in any

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.420 
be significantly better will sit in any
of<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.440> I'm<00:02:12.680> gonna<00:02:12.830> need<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.069> take<00:02:13.220> some

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
of that I'm gonna need to take some

the<00:02:57.920> focus<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.430> should<00:02:58.610> focus<00:02:58.849> on<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.269> I'm

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the focus it should focus on this I'm

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.910 
the focus it should focus on this I'm
not<00:02:59.569> sure<00:02:59.630> if<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.019> going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.620> was<00:03:00.709> kind

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
not sure if it's going to that was kind

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.699 
not sure if it's going to that was kind
of<00:03:00.980> small<00:03:01.690> relative<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.959> scene<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> may

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
of small relative to the scene so it may

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.620 
of small relative to the scene so it may
not<00:03:03.920> focus<00:03:04.370> on<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.180> looks<00:03:08.330> really

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
not focus on this but it looks really

incredibly<00:03:13.579> smooth<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.630> very<00:03:15.320> dampened

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
incredibly smooth it's a very dampened

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.930 
incredibly smooth it's a very dampened
it's<00:03:16.609> highly<00:03:17.060> dampened<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.799> aperture<00:03:19.340> very

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
it's highly dampened the aperture very

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.250 
it's highly dampened the aperture very
nice<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.570> like<00:03:20.780> got<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.989> nice<00:03:21.260> click<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.769> it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
nice it's like got a nice click to it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.789 
nice it's like got a nice click to it
can<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.319> hear<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.900> focus<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.470> very

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
can you hear that and the focus is very

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.590 
can you hear that and the focus is very
smooth<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.579> really<00:03:28.910> dampened<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.510> it

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
smooth and it's really dampened so it

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.970 
smooth and it's really dampened so it
actually<00:03:29.750> takes<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.170> little<00:03:30.290> bit<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.500> effort<00:03:30.829> to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
actually takes a little bit of effort to

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.949 
actually takes a little bit of effort to
move<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:31.970> should<00:03:32.150> be<00:03:32.180> very<00:03:32.299> easy<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.780> get

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
move so it should be very easy to get

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:40.690 
move so it should be very easy to get
precise<00:03:33.410> focus<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.250> here's<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.239> back<00:03:39.700> wow
