00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.469
 chef today 15 we want today 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.210
 we once stain a nice dax 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:19.050
 I now have almost two seasons like 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 once in the building board vectus 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.310
 superfluous once the waiver is that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.420
 if so the advantage of being dax 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.430
 even so you can grow naturally 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 determine yourself practically then again 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.110
 to taste afterwards 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.090
 you can do practically of all 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.980
 Spices just come to your mind 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:54.470
 we do now have a say here wants 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:56.180
 he comes beautifully tasted excellent 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.610
 tasted really nice wants 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.610
 Taste is already just part of it 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.610
 time I say I vary 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.110
 have even read recipes when 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.440
 you can do that for example 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.790
 gingerbread spice christmas time and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.910
 Yes, the Christmas note of the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.040
 Salmon, so to speak, and how long it takes 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.470
 a process for being with the ball 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.000
 it takes about 48 hours moment 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.399
 beautiful and converted German already 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.230
 Freerkehr totally loaded roll lie 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.330
 the salt can move in well and 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.270
 it's also about it mainly 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.150
 be it completely traditional way around 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.190
 also to preserve food 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.620
 and right here where we are here in LÃ¼neburg 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.600
 In the salt city are in fact we have 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.880
 thought again that's actually 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.930
 a very nice thing so traditional 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.090
 to work again 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.250
 just as delicious 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.280
 easy 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.940
 Contacts also at home actually 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.800
 at all 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.840
 add to limes or lemon 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.870
 The nice ones bottle one with one another 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:09.320
 I have paid attention to green switches 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.270
 I'm not exactly that kind of thing right now 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.800
 industry to that's just for the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.330
 taste what in orange gives it that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.440
 certain something and that gives them that 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.080
 certain something from his taste that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.489
 has practically the case I say 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.910
 the spice mixture that we now equal 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.700
 So give that to the dax 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.030
 salt and sugar so more salt than 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 sugar yes I have here 200 kilos of salt 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.340
 took 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.640
 I have 500 grams to work with 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.239
 the speeding leaves and under 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.239
 contract 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 all roughly ground a bit 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.120
 Now you have the nicely occupied with 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.520
 lime and now comes the beautiful 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.810
 Far exactly that explains what 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.740
 Everything in it but you can do that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.240
 vary slightly with rosmarin work 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.880
 with chilli what's so popular 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:26.380
 is natural among countless recipes 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:31.570
 like to try it out and do it now 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:37.900
 in the place of cold store after 24 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.430
 hours and then he had to quasi 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.370
 cover again or how does it work? 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.140
 I was practically talking to him once 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.360
 unexpectedly the re on 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.770
 but you do not have to say anything that works 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.810
 still with the old bands exactly 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.910
 That's why it's only going to win once 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.430
 from all sides properly steam 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.510
 All moisture must take off with it 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.510
 also keep accurate
