00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:12.209
 From now on 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.679
 Let's try a review on the m7 mechanical keyboard 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:18.000
 I'll do it 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.570
 As a writer, I usually write blogs 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.419
 But often a long word 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:33.000
 Hey , when you type using your laptop keyboard , 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:37.800
 My shoulders and wrists are a lot worse because I have a bad posture. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 And this notebook's gibudo space Koo 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 Hey, the next due to play two can make good on the keyboard gigam 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.820
 There is not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.269
 For example, when you press a key on the keyboard 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.269
 Uh well 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:00.620
 I do not press it well, so I have a bunch of fingers 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.910
 2 When pressed on the keyboard to touch the floor, touch the floor, 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.950
 Is filled 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.760
 So long typing on a laptop keyboard will require a lot of fingers. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.180
 It's possible 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.230
 So I have a very good gigam 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.970
 I bought a mechanical keyboard. 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:25.040
 What you see on the screen now is Jenix Tessoro 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:30.920
 When the tone is the keyboard. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.000
 Example 2: The inner surface is moving, the moving killing is the spinal hanger . 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 There is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.060
 That's why it's a fish axis. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.060
 The characteristics of the transfer axis are different from those of the first axis run 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.820
 In this example, the councilor 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.860
 The pressure is the weakest. So what do you mean? 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:59.210
 Oh, that's how I write it, even if I press it like that. 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.400
 So if you blow him up , then the sawdust, like a cloud of clouds , 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.460
 You can do it 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:11.060
 The keyboard is a lot of hope when typing long documents are examples that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.470
 To people or to Monkey 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.470
 I'll try the tires. 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.709
 Genix mechanical keyboard accessories 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.790
 Because the word by pressing a very light force that went well 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:42.250
 At first it may be a little inconvenient, 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.250
 Here's a look at some more typing will soon learn to clean up dn
