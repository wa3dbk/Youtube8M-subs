00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.330
 very good I'm nico and in this video 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.640
 let's show how the new one works 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.339
 activation block that incorporates ios 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.740
 7 is a security system 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.660
 very complete with which thieves do not 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.520
 they will be able to use the device to not 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.950
 be that they know the apple id and the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.380
 password that was activated or 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.690
 associated even if they restore the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.600
 device from itunes in mode 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.240
 fruit a little could to activate this 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.610
 service once we have ios 7 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.060
 installed we would have to go inside 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.780
 of adjustments 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.780
 icloud 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 look for my iphone and we should have 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.079
 activated the two boxes to find my 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.129
 iphone and activation lock 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.049
 let's imagine that we have found a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.260
 iphone and we want to restore the values 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.909
 factory if we click on restore 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.289
 iphone will appear a window 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:04.039
 indicating that I deactivated the option before 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.039
 to look for my iphone 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.020
 if we try to disable the option of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.420
 search my Iphone 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.750
 will ask us for the password of the id 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.640
 apple with which is blocked so 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.759
 that the next step would be to leave the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.100
 device in efe mode and restore it 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.780
 from itunes but in doing this it will happen 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.320
 the following we are going to do it on camera 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.409
 quick so you can see the process 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.630
 good as you know the df you have to press 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.360
 10 seconds the power and home button 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.580
 at 10 seconds drop the power and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.610
 I let him keep it until he appears in 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.110
 Itunes a message indicating that 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.920
 found an iphone in mode 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.920
 Recovery 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.550
 we accept that message 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.520
 and now if we press restore iphone and 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.730
 will allow us to install it in this 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 case let's directly select the 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.400
 version ios 6.1 point 3 which is the last 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.160
 which offers apple for this device 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.450
 specifically let's give it to camera 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.450
 fast until the end 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.750
 once it finishes we put the code 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.980
 pin 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.400
 we unlocked we selected the language on 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.400
 country 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.170
 here we can select a wifi network 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.410
 connect itunes or if it appears 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.720
 data coverage on the top 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.450
 we can use mobile connection 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.990
 I'll wait for 3g to appear 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.990
 connect 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.660
 well then once you connect in this 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.700
 process should be when apple creates the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.040
 verification code because a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.940
 then we will appear on 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.440
 message that we mentioned to you at the beginning 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.740
 that we have to put the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.250
 apple id password that was activated 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.440
 on this iphone 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.020
 we'll see how this process works 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.460
 because hackers can launch some 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.800
 tool to activate the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.720
 devices and if it's not like that if you 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.300
 you find an iphone the best thing is that what 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.990
 come back and maybe you can receive a 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.060
 reward 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.370
 this is all we hope you have 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.620
