00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
okay I have a little problem here I was

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.910 
okay I have a little problem here I was
putting<00:00:05.330> the<00:00:05.479> rear<00:00:05.810> jato<00:00:07.540> axles<00:00:08.540> on<00:00:08.830> and<00:00:09.830> when

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
putting the rear jato axles on and when

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.330 
putting the rear jato axles on and when
I<00:00:09.949> noticed<00:00:10.400> that<00:00:11.020> you<00:00:12.020> see<00:00:12.230> that<00:00:12.440> gap<00:00:12.740> right

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
I noticed that you see that gap right

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.250 
I noticed that you see that gap right
there

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.370 

when<00:00:17.950> it<00:00:18.540> compresses<00:00:19.540> and<00:00:19.870> the<00:00:19.960> suspension

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
when it compresses and the suspension

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.480 
when it compresses and the suspension
travels<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.840> hits<00:00:23.230> right<00:00:23.860> there<00:00:24.220> so<00:00:24.700> my<00:00:25.390> arm

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
travels it hits right there so my arm

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.580 
travels it hits right there so my arm
suspension<00:00:27.490> travel<00:00:27.730> would<00:00:28.090> only<00:00:28.210> be<00:00:28.810> so<00:00:29.110> you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
suspension travel would only be so you

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.440 
suspension travel would only be so you
know<00:00:29.760> not<00:00:30.760> a<00:00:30.790> lot

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
know not a lot

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.320 
know not a lot
so<00:00:32.169> over<00:00:32.320> here<00:00:32.440> on<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.590> stock<00:00:32.890> truck<00:00:33.309> see<00:00:34.150> how

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
so over here on the stock truck see how

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.400 
so over here on the stock truck see how
the<00:00:34.390> gap<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:37.239> there<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:39.070> where<00:00:40.260> when<00:00:41.260> you

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
the gap is right there to where when you

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.180 
the gap is right there to where when you
hit<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> bump<00:00:41.920> or<00:00:42.190> go<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.640> jump<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.870> truck<00:00:44.290> comes

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
hit a bump or go to jump the truck comes

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.550 
hit a bump or go to jump the truck comes
down<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.910> is<00:00:49.090> pinching<00:00:49.450> arm<00:00:49.950> almost<00:00:50.950> go<00:00:51.070> up

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
down this is pinching arm almost go up

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.140 
down this is pinching arm almost go up
and<00:00:53.560> this<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:53.980> gap<00:00:55.020> comes<00:00:56.020> up<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.910> gets<00:00:58.090> a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
and this to the gap comes up it gets a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.830 
and this to the gap comes up it gets a
little<00:00:58.270> wider<00:00:58.570> right<00:00:59.380> there<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.660> when<00:01:01.750> you

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
little wider right there so when you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.420 
little wider right there so when you
jump<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:03.509> there<00:01:04.509> suspension<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.350> normal<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
jump in there suspension is normal and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.359 
jump in there suspension is normal and
when<00:01:06.550> it's<00:01:06.700> compressed<00:01:07.649> here<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.800> axle<00:01:09.190> goes

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
when it's compressed here the axle goes

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.139 
when it's compressed here the axle goes
into<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.229> well<00:01:11.229> this<00:01:11.530> one<00:01:11.800> on<00:01:12.340> Lex<00:01:12.670> will<00:01:12.940> drive

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
into it well this one on Lex will drive

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.670 
into it well this one on Lex will drive
with<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.479> Jade<00:01:13.690> or<00:01:13.840> ears<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:17.320> how<00:01:17.470> big<00:01:17.649> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
with the Jade or ears that's how big the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.309 
with the Jade or ears that's how big the
gap<00:01:17.920> is<00:01:18.160> so<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.119> suspension<00:01:20.460> compresses

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
gap is so on the suspension compresses

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.359 
gap is so on the suspension compresses
it's<00:01:23.319> going<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.590> hit<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.920> that's<00:01:24.100> about<00:01:24.220> all

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
it's going to hit and that's about all

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.639 
it's going to hit and that's about all
it's<00:01:24.729> gonna<00:01:24.819> be<00:01:24.970> able<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.119> compress<00:01:25.479> which<00:01:26.470> is

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
it's gonna be able to compress which is

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.730 
it's gonna be able to compress which is
that<00:01:26.770> not<00:01:26.950> much<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:29.350> here

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.670 

about<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.550> much<00:01:36.230> look<00:01:37.230> how<00:01:37.350> much<00:01:37.440> further

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
about that much look how much further

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.610 
about that much look how much further
can<00:01:37.800> go<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:39.170> mean<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.350> really

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
can go down I mean that's really

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.020 
can go down I mean that's really

know all the way down you know you know
this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.330> hit<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
this is not going to hit and then this

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.490 
this is not going to hit and then this
one<00:01:59.030> it<00:02:00.030> will

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.880 

see<00:02:04.040> how<00:02:04.130> close<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:05.470> when<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.560> compresses

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
see how close it is when it compresses

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.980 
see how close it is when it compresses
is<00:02:07.160> going<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> hit<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.850> neck<00:02:08.330> how<00:02:08.450> much<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.840> is

the Jade oh there's a stalk so if you
look<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.610> bottom<00:02:31.940> one<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.330> Jade<00:02:32.540> oh

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
look here the bottom one is the Jade oh

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.150 
look here the bottom one is the Jade oh
and<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:34.490> top<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:36.010> stock<00:02:37.210> chill<00:02:38.210> drive

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and the top one is the stock chill drive

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.250 
and the top one is the stock chill drive
see<00:02:40.160> how<00:02:40.250> much<00:02:40.370> more<00:02:40.640> longer<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.120> j2<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.200> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
see how much more longer the j2 is so I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.180 
see how much more longer the j2 is so I
need<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.470> trim<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:42.910> just<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.060> tad<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:45.190> that's
