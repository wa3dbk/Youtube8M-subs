00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:07.011
 I 44. 

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:10.103
 Enough, because we do not use balls on training. 

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:12.219
 Hey, old ... 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.127
 And why are there no balls for everyone on the match? 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.986
 Hola, you are tawarisz! 

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.758
 You are alone? 

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:36.707
 Well now I'm with two guys in skins. 

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.229
 We want to offer you a great offer, but it's a secret. 

00:00:42.574 --> 00:00:45.136
 Shhh! Do not tell me because it's a secret! 

00:00:47.853 --> 00:00:50.852
 It can all be yours. 

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:53.782
 Are you so stupid or do you make balls? 

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.626
 Why do you give me a full suitcase, eh? 

00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:02.640
 I will not even take my vacation here ... You have to go with this ... 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.458
 Think it's full ... 

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:21.611
 Now I've got it! 

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:30.889
 The point is that you picked up a snot and you still have a lot in your suitcase. 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.234
 Listen, you are tawarisz. 

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:40.320
 You take cash and stand. 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.710
 If I won with fear, how should I lose? 

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:48.420
 Niet. You have to lose the match, because then we will win. 

00:01:48.422 --> 00:01:51.470
 Ah, sure, are you from a team of rivals? 

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.260
 No, we bet. 

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:54.310
 For what? 

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:55.620
 That you will lose. 

00:01:55.618 --> 00:01:57.370
 But the coach said we were to win! 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.350
 But we gave you money to lose! 

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.480
 But how can we win if we lose? 

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.700
 Easy, calm, Mikhail! 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.550
 We are returning to the arms trade, there are some negotiations. 

00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:17.020
 Dear children watching Crackòvia, what have we learned today? 

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:20.280
 The Russians go along, talk a bit like Catalan. 

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:23.860
 And if some stranger gives you money on the street, do not take them. 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.460
 Let the candy go first - but do not take it too. 

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:31.810
 There may be blue candies there and blue ones are pineapple. 

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.940
 How can it be that pineapple is yellow and the candy is blue ... 

00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:39.930
 But if the pineapple is yellow, why does not it taste like a lemon ... 

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.010
 But this life has problems, dear children watching Crackòvia. 

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.260
 Okay, until next!
