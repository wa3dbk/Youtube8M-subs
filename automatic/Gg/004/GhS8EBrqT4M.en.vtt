00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:12.469
 the mayor of Brazil 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.519
 unprecedented achievement of the liberators 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.559
 worldcup vacancy 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.630
 they sold corinthians another title 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.270
 that for the time being it was not so 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.360
 expected by the club is the largest crowd 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.460
 Brazil and that guarantees the company ipsos 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.140
 marplan and specializes in research 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.540
 according to a study carried out in the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.730
 first quarter of 2012 with more than 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.590
 14,000 people in 12 capitals and even in 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.330
 interior of são paulo the corinthians 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.550
 have overcome flamenguistas and now 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.040
 represent 19% of fans 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.590
 Brazilians against 18 of Rio rivals 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.700
 followed by Pauline Saint Paul and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.680
 Basque 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.150
 and this taking into account that the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.590
 blacks are still the majority in 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.140
 some important Brazilian cities 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.030
 the example of Brasilia and the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.250
 vascaínos appear as the second largest 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 and in Goiânia where 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.870
 Corintians and Tricolores from São Paulo 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.190
 also stand out against the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.560
 goiás fans 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.810
 anyway the controversy is in the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.490
 who has the biggest crowd 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.690
 Corinthians or Flemish 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.690
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.939
 I think the Flemish still at first 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.039
 I do not know, I like this taste for everything I do not think 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.289
 that may have passed cyrus is at this time 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.509
 I believe that yes that it has passed 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.780
 so the law brings there that it is a 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.900
 funny thing 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.900
 [Applause] 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.720
 but a short time ago the Flemish was 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.850
 considered the largest in the world but that's it 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.770
 I think I'm in a style and it appears 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 When is tiber team champion okay? 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.900
 As a good flamenco player, I do not believe in 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.880
 the research I find strange is evenly matched and 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.620
 I do not agree to a lying search. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.300
 As I speak, this is balela. 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.940
 corinthians crowd is very big 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.440
 but it is bigger than Flemish is not medium 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.750
 and for no one else 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.050
 already in Sao Paulo the Corinthian supremacy 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.570
 is even higher in the capital 48% of 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.940
 supporters are 23-tricolor alvinegros 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.040
 and 15 to live in the state to 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.580
 difference is smaller but so expressive 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.520
 45% are Corinthians, 24 are 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.410
 Paulines and only 13% from Palmeiras 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.570
 What do you think, Monday, I think 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.180
 that's a little bit boring all this comes 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.950
 it is not too much to try to increase further 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 that the Corinthian fan to grow in a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 little wrong rate it should increase 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.570
 many more years ago São Paulo has more 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.880
 than the palm trees 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.590
 I think it's a little bit, Mother, much more. 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.180
 do not fall first, you 're paulo, have to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.730
 be wise let's say né 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.650
 I do not think it's going to work like that. 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.570
 It's wrong, São Paulo, between Rio de Janeiro. 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.520
 and although the stage is not the best 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.880
 Flemish domain in the capital 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.610
 Fluminense reaches 55% of supporters 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.610
 second place with only 16 is the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.930
 Basque was not flamenco but I think 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.520
 any place preserved and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.690
 Flemish or Flemish in any 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:02.280
 place that arrives for 25 in all Brazil 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.170
 to study the way even a search does not 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.430
 is restricted to the axis rio são paulo a 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 controversy goes beyond 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.140
 in bh for example the Cruzeirense crowd 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.989
 exceeds 16 percent of vice leader 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.060
 athletic 41 years a great title that 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.650
 had it so impossible 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.480
 It's a lie, I believe in this kind of 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.580
 search depending on the moment the fans 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.959
 this search also moves me 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.420
 I think it's also wrong that 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.800
 You'll look at this in the ratchets of 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.390
 independence day 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.319
 the rooster sunday 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.050
 is already in salvador are 37% of fans 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.000
 of Bahia against 25 of the victory in the capital 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.800
 paranaense the athletic crowd 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.830
 corresponds to 32% 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.900
 exactly the double of coritiba with 16 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.050
 while in fortress dispute is 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.450
 are 26% of alvinegros against 20 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.540
 of colors in floripa the domain is the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.140
 figueirense 37 percent against 21 of the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.540
 Hawaii 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.650
 on the reef the order is this sport santa 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.480
 cross and nautical 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.720
 in Porto Alegre the crowd of the team is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.280
 11% higher than the inter will talk 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.290
 this for the gauchos 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.480
 she is small to prove the theory in 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.580
 with 60 not reflecting the city 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.080
 registered the olympic there in the inter 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.660
 began in the most important title 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.010
 most recently the guild since the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.440
 80's already won worldwide 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180
 liberators the guild can not be higher 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.709
 than the larger hospital of the rio grande 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.120
 we'll always see I think I just lost until 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.420
 the ones that best give you a look at 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.730
 margin of error of the search is wrong 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.859
 [Applause] 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.859
