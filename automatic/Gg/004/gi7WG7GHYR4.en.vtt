the<00:00:30.689> time<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.900> say<00:00:31.230> how<00:00:31.349> short<00:00:31.650> my<00:00:31.710> lashes<00:00:32.009> are

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the time I say how short my lashes are

the time I say how short my lashes are
they're<00:00:32.489> short<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.850> curly<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.750> makes

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
they're short and curly so that makes

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.709 
they're short and curly so that makes
them<00:00:34.020> look<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:34.440> shorter<00:00:35.480> but<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.600> been

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
them look even shorter but I've been

using<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> product<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> have

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
using this product and you know I have

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.790 
using this product and you know I have
live<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.600> user<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> week<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
live at user for a week now because you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.720 
live at user for a week now because you
know<00:00:40.920> I've<00:00:41.040> done<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:42.090> trial<00:00:43.730> but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
know I've done with my little trial but

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729 
know I've done with my little trial but
my<00:00:44.789> lashes<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.360> definitely<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> lot<00:00:46.140> longer

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
my lashes are definitely a lot longer

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
my lashes are definitely a lot longer
and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.059> probably<00:00:48.149> hard<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> tell

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and I know it's probably hard to tell

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.110 
and I know it's probably hard to tell
because<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.070> walk<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.789> zoom<00:00:50.940> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
because you know walk as I could zoom in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.410 
because you know walk as I could zoom in
but<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.110> help<00:00:52.260> much

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
but I don't think that will help much

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.610 
but I don't think that will help much
yeah<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.410> how

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
yeah you can just kind of see like how

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.250 
yeah you can just kind of see like how
much<00:00:55.920> lengthier<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.270> normal

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
much lengthier they are from normal

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.310 
much lengthier they are from normal
there's<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.780> can't<00:01:00.780> feel<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.199> idiot

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
there's that can't feel like an idiot

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250 
there's that can't feel like an idiot
doing<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.629> yeah<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> did<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:04.110> before
