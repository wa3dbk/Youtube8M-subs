one<00:00:07.200> that's<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.830> little<00:00:08.040> tricky<00:00:08.280> it's

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
one that's it's a little tricky it's

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.240

to the desired health pool I'll talk

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
to the desired health pool I'll talk
about<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.270> bit<00:00:39.390> later<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> then

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
about a little bit later and then

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830 
about a little bit later and then
there's<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> caster<00:00:41.280> ad<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:42.300> yes<00:00:42.690> it

there's a caster ad which has yes it
looks<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> normal<00:00:43.290> aggro<00:00:43.680> table<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.100> his

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
looks like a normal aggro table but his

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
looks like a normal aggro table but his
cast<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.940> cast<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.600> random<00:00:45.870> raid<00:00:46.020> members<00:00:46.350> or

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
cast are cast at random raid members or

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
cast are cast at random raid members or
party<00:00:47.340> members<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> will<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
party members if you will in the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.860 
party members if you will in the
five-man<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.120> basically<00:00:51.449> help<00:00:51.719> out

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
five-man so I I just basically help out

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
five-man so I I just basically help out
where<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.649> silence<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.430> cast<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.059> do

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
where I can to silence the cast and do

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
where I can to silence the cast and do
the<00:00:54.960> damage<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.829> since<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.340> only<00:00:56.670> have

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the damage that I can since we only have

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.380 
the damage that I can since we only have
one<00:00:57.120> dps<00:00:57.719> split<00:00:58.170> off<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.250> kill<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> cats<00:01:00.180> or

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
one dps split off and kill the cats or

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.479 
one dps split off and kill the cats or
add<00:01:00.510> while<00:01:00.780> other<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.500> dps<00:01:01.829> are<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> boss

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
add while other two dps are on the boss

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.960 
add while other two dps are on the boss
full<00:01:02.760> time<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> basically<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> want<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.640> dps

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
full time so basically you want your dps

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.450 
full time so basically you want your dps
on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> boss<00:01:06.479> full<00:01:07.200> time<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.950> he's<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
on the boss full time because he's got I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
on the boss full time because he's got I
believe<00:01:08.790> while<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> shields<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.750> about

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
believe while that shields up it's about

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
believe while that shields up it's about
ninety<00:01:10.260> percent<00:01:10.380> damage<00:01:10.710> reduction<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
ninety percent damage reduction so I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
ninety percent damage reduction so I
mean<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.420> hard<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> break<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
mean it's it's really hard to break that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.740 
mean it's it's really hard to break that
brick<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.799> into<00:01:13.950> his<00:01:14.070> health<00:01:14.280> pool<00:01:14.509> but<00:01:15.509> our

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
brick get into his health pool but our

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.679 
brick get into his health pool but our
goal<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.580> get<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:18.119> seventy

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
goal is to get them to about seventy

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
goal is to get them to about seventy
percent<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.229> 75%<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.040> can't<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.400> remember

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
percent or 75% I can't really remember

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
percent or 75% I can't really remember
the<00:01:20.729> video<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:21.930> him<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.229> 70<00:01:22.530> 75

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the video but we get him to about 70 75

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249 
the video but we get him to about 70 75
percent<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.750> start<00:01:24.960> burning

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
percent and that's when we start burning

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
percent and that's when we start burning
at<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.860> happens<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> shield

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
at so now what happens is that shield

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
at so now what happens is that shield
comes<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> third<00:01:27.960> melee<00:01:28.409> ad<00:01:28.619> dies

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
comes down when the third melee ad dies

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
comes down when the third melee ad dies
and<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:29.790> only<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.030> three<00:01:30.360> mela<00:01:30.630> ads<00:01:30.810> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and there will only be three mela ads so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
and there will only be three mela ads so
ideally<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> limited<00:01:33.270> mana<00:01:33.479> pool

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
ideally if you have a limited mana pool

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
ideally if you have a limited mana pool
for<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.259> healer<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.890> could<00:01:35.070> tank<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
for your healer you could tank that

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 
for your healer you could tank that
third<00:01:36.270> ad<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.840> long<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.259> needed<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
third ad for as long as you needed and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
kill last pretty simple concept and then

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.239

you<00:02:16.209> just<00:02:16.390> go<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.109> boss<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.889> way<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.069> get

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.249 
you just go on the boss the way to get

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.679 
you just go on the boss the way to get
the<00:02:18.340> achievement<00:02:18.459> is<00:02:18.939> the<00:02:19.150> melee<00:02:19.480> ads

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
the achievement is the melee ads

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.589 
the achievement is the melee ads
actually<00:02:20.109> when<00:02:20.620> they<00:02:20.739> die<00:02:21.010> they<00:02:21.340> will<00:02:21.569> emit<00:02:22.569> a

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
actually when they die they will emit a

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.050 
actually when they die they will emit a
debuff<00:02:23.230> quote<00:02:23.530> buff<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.489> shows<00:02:24.790> up<00:02:24.909> as<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
debuff quote buff it shows up as a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.640 
debuff quote buff it shows up as a
debuff<00:02:25.480> but<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.840> believe<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.170> buffs<00:02:26.379> your

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
debuff but I believe it buffs your

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.129 
debuff but I believe it buffs your
damage<00:02:27.040> something<00:02:27.999> like<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.329> anyway<00:02:28.840> so

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
damage something like that anyway so

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.720 
damage something like that anyway so
it's<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.620> pretty<00:02:29.799> small<00:02:29.920> range<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.459> make<00:02:30.700> sure

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
it's a pretty small range so make sure

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.470 
it's a pretty small range so make sure
that<00:02:30.909> you're<00:02:31.180> next<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.659> when<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.810> dies<00:02:32.079> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that you're next to it when it dies and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.729 
that you're next to it when it dies and
it'll<00:02:34.480> give<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.719> a<00:02:34.810> damage<00:02:35.200> buff<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.590> that

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
it'll give you a damage buff and that

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.039 
it'll give you a damage buff and that
will<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.159> enough<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.239> know<00:02:37.269> blow<00:02:37.900> your

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
will be enough to you know blow your

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.569 
will be enough to you know blow your
cooldowns<00:02:38.439> and<00:02:38.680> kill<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.920> boss<00:02:39.069> hopefully

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
cooldowns and kill the boss hopefully

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.879 
cooldowns and kill the boss hopefully
the<00:02:40.510> hard<00:02:40.719> thing<00:02:40.959> about<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.379> fight<00:02:41.650> is

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
the hard thing about this fight is

you'll see there's just a lot of damage
that's<00:02:44.409> not<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:44.980> avoidable<00:02:45.400> yeah<00:02:45.700> there

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879

that's not really avoidable yeah there
is<00:02:46.000> obvious<00:02:46.540> avoidable<00:02:47.200> damage<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:47.769> the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
is obvious avoidable damage like the

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.619 
is obvious avoidable damage like the
green<00:02:48.129> clouds<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.609> float<00:02:48.879> around<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.510> the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
and what we decided was about a good

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.379 
and what we decided was about a good
health<00:03:05.709> pool<00:03:05.949> for<00:03:06.159> them<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.519> was<00:03:06.879> about<00:03:07.090> fifty

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
health pool for them all was about fifty

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.509 
health pool for them all was about fifty
