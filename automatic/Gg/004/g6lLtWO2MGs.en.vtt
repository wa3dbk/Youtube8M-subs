00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.710
 when in fact we regret that his life is not the davie of the times the 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.370
 heart kids more perennial systems he had to a guy 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.059
 disadvantages but he could not be today so what do 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.010
 a technique that is derived from the pantone system 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 yet well gone since you know this system is what you 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.359
 can we touch two two months 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.039
 listen it's very possible 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.100
 and when I started to install his 106 lots of people wrote me in 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.140
 saying yes you know it's a prayer room 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.720
 mulched it's been decades of kong 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.020
 like fuels to increase the combustion efficiency 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.370
 in thermal power plants 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 I remember that in the first rounds of which the Hong Kong actor drops 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.510
 combustion with water injection in this world but why do we put 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 the water 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.890
 in a constant fuel what is it for 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.319
 and for the equestrian practice of water 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.619
 he was again access point of the coi his place in the top 8 explained a 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:55.370
 little simpler home last year so legends ap 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.180
 but ask to come and see a little bit of all this 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 but I could see 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.430
 devices in operation I remember that I was extremely 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.130
 surprised to see a system that had not been mounted on the same 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.810
 the merchant of this gazelle 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.240
 demonstrator problem his life is a bit of a foot putting escape ko 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.910
 and where he went through manchester all black it is necessary to connect it is not black 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.600
 no I told myself one researcher out of two still make even experiences 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.620
 if all four paws I breathed in today's show for a dozen but 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 I assure you that gives you ideas of the decrease of noise pollution 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.600
 spectacular I can not stay long but it's true that m when we 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.330
 puts his nose in the taxes of people said a lot and especially not a whiff 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.960
 air so how's it going to work something like that here in my opinion because 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.150
 it was not yet cleared so we arrive in the room jean-paul 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.409
 dumais nothing we will build a team that's what is terrible is that m 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.170
 these are fundamental physics problems that are essential 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.359
 it must be said that in addition to the three-fold number of laboratories working 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.229
 it was to imagine a little more his nerves and his football tomorrow the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 department of suez looking too crazy it's the only current tax then to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.460
 what she may be 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.010
 the accused had but his case manufactured the lot's deputy 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.380
 it's bullshit 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.660
 she already has a girl from an audience so I want to participate in the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.240
 debate it allows the widow since already paul-hubert is more than expected 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.589
 hen 4 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.329
 I will try to cover 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.140
 ac 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.690
 it's happening with their own structural problems and 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.899
 allow one's breath 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.359
 yes to the letter when you take a storm cloud for example in this case 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.649
 isolated thunderstorms an order that made you have particles of 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.140
 ice that drops zealous water droplets that goes up 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.079
 and then France on others 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.419
 and it's electrified 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.949
 and here the proof is that it's a snake lightning discharge of 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.709
 often phenomenal detention so in wallet systems the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.740
 scada systems 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.900
 it works a little way its brands 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.360
 we first use the lupo exhaust energy to heat water this 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.310
 which is true in these rates have made air pass 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.220
 for nokia 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.150
 in output of what is called their e a mixture of curtains with them it's 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.340
 one thing that needs to be analyzed with them a water equalizer and after that it's 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.609
 inspired by AIDS and it goes between two concentric suzanne 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.999
 around an object that looks a bit like a weavers shuttle the distance 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.709
 between the two walls his family is weakened and this has mixed with 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.419
 fuel 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.649
 and it turns out that that moment that the performance the 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.489
 previous low-normandy fuel consumption wearing this 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.059
 advantage of this type of system canadians will be removed pollution 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.969
 and the president of the organization for me two years ago 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.109
 gabriel heinze actually it's true that so far we tend cigars that the 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.279
 renewable energy what more is fuel by could be 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.309
 an alternative solution to oil but on the other hand here too we can 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:46.529
 challenge the fec-csq actually a little sometimes it can pollute as much there 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.590
 not at all this is precisely the interest of the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.429
 they are talking to each other 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.919
 circus 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:51.720
 we reduce 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.720
 Friday's consumption easily 46 1% 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.990
 and then we reduce pollution 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.590
 and we knew it screaming 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.309
 one year ago 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.779
 a financial man a study 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:04.749
 and we never had an answer 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:06.939
 we are lucky to meet jean-pierre petit 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.749
 and jean-paul dumais nothing and it will be done 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.469
 it happened like an official channel 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:13.859
 it's still a pity 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.019
 that excess not met 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.780
 she managed to intercept why it works these people were telling each other 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.370
 what are these appointments like that with fuel and then we have 50% of 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.040
 reduction 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.700
 not just that what we put in the cylinder is not fuel I do not 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.380
 do not know 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.600
 the mixture for example of gasoline or kerosene and air there are also 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.410
 electrified water molecules and these molecules use it 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.450
 to break the water molecules of the doctor murray we mounted the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.500
 novel combustion 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.780
 so the single currency 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.320
 there is no miracle road I do not think we destroy left think not 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.330
 that we draw from the energies of emptiness anything 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.440
 we only know that the very simple one increases the combustion efficiency 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.259
 because the writers fill in his wake 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.129
 many and the party the rest it goes into a catalytic converter for 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.430
 avoid these lawsuits towards what it's about burning fuel for 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.740
 heat kiosks 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.930
 - Why 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.589
 green pure happiness 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.209
 always in the morning at recruiters face these levels console sony 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.150
 however the low time of play I am waiting for your sales 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.740
 the doctor that i feel the diver my colleague daniel turgeon automatic 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.520
 who normally 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.639
 it's the expansion tank that connected a hose for robert him what me 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.599
 give my constant level in the desert 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.879
 it hurts one because many British newspapers is worth 1 4 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:26.379
 point 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.139
 the p the line 23 41 points 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.460
 percent and an ordinary one-inch waters changed the flow of gases 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.159
 exhaust that have passed in butter because the more we pass 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.159
 damage in the scorer 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.289
 six years our entourage nor his turn 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.130
 here 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.279
 business 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.279
 here we have the rector so out of goal scorer 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.589
 at the palace in the reactor where there is the rod 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.099
 here is he is not familiar with a millimeter 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.289
 worse at the reactor outlet directly to the air intake 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.460
 willard 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.830
 additionally our paid video character 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.099
 to recreate a depression 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.099
 p and make sure that admission to say more 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.550
 later on their commission should be the first should happen as 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.159
 that in a current that is even more depressions and more exasperation 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.159
 in the reactor 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:25.990
 Yes
