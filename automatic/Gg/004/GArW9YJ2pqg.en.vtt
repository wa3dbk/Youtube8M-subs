this website very quickly because I know

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.499 
this website very quickly because I know
you're<00:00:05.069> probably<00:00:05.190> busy<00:00:05.460> I'll<00:00:05.970> explain<00:00:06.150> l

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
you're probably busy I'll explain l

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.450 
you're probably busy I'll explain l
cpanel<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.290> old<00:00:07.410> cpanel<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.859> our<00:00:08.010> own<00:00:08.130> design

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
cpanel the old cpanel is our own design

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.669 
cpanel the old cpanel is our own design
it's<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.300> very<00:00:09.480> special<00:00:09.660> design<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.380> designed

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
it's a very special design it's designed

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.200 
it's a very special design it's designed
to<00:00:10.740> be<00:00:10.800> very<00:00:10.860> lightweight<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.880> our<00:00:11.969> four

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to be very lightweight one of our four

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.270 
to be very lightweight one of our four
by<00:00:12.360> six<00:00:12.630> cloth-covered<00:00:13.170> panels<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:13.920> instance

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
by six cloth-covered panels for instance

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.799 
by six cloth-covered panels for instance
only<00:00:14.580> weighs<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:14.910> 12<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> half<00:00:15.509> pounds

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
only weighs about 12 and a half pounds

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
only weighs about 12 and a half pounds
so<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> very<00:00:16.949> lightweight<00:00:17.250> panel<00:00:17.789> panel

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
so it's a very lightweight panel panel

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.519 
so it's a very lightweight panel panel
that's<00:00:18.539> two<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> quarter<00:00:18.960> inches<00:00:19.109> thick

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
that's two and a quarter inches thick

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250 
that's two and a quarter inches thick
and<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.010> fairly<00:00:20.189> tough<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> designed

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and it's fairly tough but it is designed

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080 
and it's fairly tough but it is designed
to<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:23.160> reduces<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> cost<00:00:23.910> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to be like this reduces the cost of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.759 
to be like this reduces the cost of
shipping<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.779> makes<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.140> easier<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.410> install

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
shipping it makes it easier to install

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.240 
shipping it makes it easier to install
and<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.789> easier<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> handle<00:00:27.390> um<00:00:28.250> everything

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
and it's easier to handle um everything

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.650 
and it's easier to handle um everything
that<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.910> custom<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> don't

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that we do here is custom we don't

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600 
that we do here is custom we don't
generally<00:00:31.199> stock<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> panels<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.309> we

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
generally stock a lot of panels here we

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.250 
generally stock a lot of panels here we
wait<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> customer<00:00:33.989> needs<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
wait to see what a customer needs and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
wait to see what a customer needs and
then<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.530> make<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
then we make it from there so if you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
then we make it from there so if you
needed<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> panel<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> certain<00:00:37.680> size

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
needed a panel that was a certain size

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 
needed a panel that was a certain size
like<00:00:38.870> 36<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> quarter<00:00:40.379> inches<00:00:40.410> wide<00:00:40.829> by

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
like 36 and a quarter inches wide by

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
like 36 and a quarter inches wide by
eating<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.879> inches<00:00:42.210> tall<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.930> simply

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
eating I inches tall we would simply

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
eating I inches tall we would simply
make<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.559> size<00:00:43.739> panel<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
make that size panel for you so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
make that size panel for you so
everything<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.809> custom<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.210> price

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
everything is custom we do have a price

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
everything is custom we do have a price

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.620 
135 degree angle we can do that now we
can<00:01:36.369> just<00:01:36.460> make<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.759> connectors<00:01:37.149> for<00:01:37.270> them<00:01:37.420> so

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
can just make the connectors for them so

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.290 
can just make the connectors for them so
it's<00:01:37.780> not<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.930> problem<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:39.970> comes<00:01:40.119> to

particular<00:02:45.840> design<00:02:46.790> now<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.090> also<00:02:48.270> 3d<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
particular design now we can also 3d the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.480 
particular design now we can also 3d the
design<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.740> show<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.070> what<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.340> will<00:02:50.460> look

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
design and show you what it will look

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.830 
design and show you what it will look
like<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.060> all<00:02:51.150> put<00:02:51.180> together<00:02:51.420> from

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
like when it's all put together from

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960 
like when it's all put together from
various<00:02:52.140> angles<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.520> an<00:02:53.640> idea<00:02:53.700> of

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
various angles so you can get an idea of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
various angles so you can get an idea of
what<00:02:54.930> what's<00:02:55.350> really<00:02:55.620> going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.830> look<00:02:55.950> like

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
what what's really going to look like

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.670 
what what's really going to look like
