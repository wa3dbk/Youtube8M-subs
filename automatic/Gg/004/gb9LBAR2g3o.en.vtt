00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:08.590
 Tree when the original Driving School 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:11.799
 The 5th final round is a course debut 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 At first carpet run here 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.940
 I want to do it 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.900
 i went went Stars 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.950
 Here is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.860
 Kanagawa key Roh Tsuji 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.860
 It is the carpet force of route 246 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:46.840
 Yes First one eye point of it is to run straight straight 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.150
 It is easy to run straight if this is a very difficult car model 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.670
 In fact 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.670
 Nobel can't run straight 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.340
 Go straight 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.970
 Yes I'm actually going straight and now I'm doing pairing operations like this 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.970
 Infield 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:16.820
 Yes straight from here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.820
 Even though it looks as if it is running straight like aiko , it actually uses the correct correction rudder 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.610
 Let's look again 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.960
 Yes here is the last 6 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 I am using the correction rudder in small steps is one point is this hairpin 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.690
 Here we always come to new Yu in the corner 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.600
 Make bikes natural 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:48.500
 Tilted have now is contact with the soul of the movement on the ground 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:53.870
 And then Well Can you grasp a little bit accelerator It is from here 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.940
 It was already very well adaptable now have is a little hard to case the accelerator 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.940
 So this is different from a car 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 Yes but many 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.080
 The driver's person wants to turn here I cut the pairing to the right 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.080
 Yes it is difficult to get 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.290
 What happened when the left edge to 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.040
 Yes I'm going straight on the bike 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.380
 Such a hairpin because alphanumeric 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.210
 When you turn Pan 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.230
 I need to talk about the scary section 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.110
 Yes, just enter the accelerator from here while talking here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.780
 Enter only the accelerator 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.780
 Yes then you can bend like this with the smallest radius 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:54.940
 Yes Enter the hairpin from here and turn it back to the left 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:03:00.610
 In this way, you must aim for the next corner when driving a motorcycle 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.320
 The next corner does not flow with only one corner, so it bends more than this 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.560
 It is the next left immediately after 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.550
 Please do match here of timing also 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:16.090
 Yes and it is very important to run the course 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.300
 It's a gyro setting, so by the way of today's bike 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.860
 left 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.150
 The high speed is quite right on the left side of the essential point 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.050
 And the right side is 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.940
 It is the weakest first Terry squeeze brother 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:39.560
 The two gyro March 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.560
 Please try to Settings while trying various It is to fit in around the time of his 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:53.290
 Yes and finally the most difficult 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.290
 It is a turn circuit today I prepared the circuit Bosomaru 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.230
 Different things compared to the moving carpeted Osaka course 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:07.650
 It Naa person of such 180 degrees 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:11.600
 To On'naya is a place that is made depending on the combination of the 90-degree corner 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:18.739
 It is exactly to clear this yeah 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:24.250
 Tilt the bike and cause after the if you must this work 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:30.100
 It's microphone when approaching the entrance of the Corner 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.790
 Andre disconnect the Kyokuri from there Kedomo has been cut to the left First course until just before here 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.849
 The 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.760
 Like this the roller has a ball 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:44.849
 I wish I touched bullying 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:50.580
 Here, first you say that there is Te quality and to return to the furnace and now slowly forward Mike 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:54.449
 So yes it will turn automatically and also this will be the case and it's the next one 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.840
 From here, put a little throttle on the transmitter 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:02.580
 Further down the right side Ys pairing Te 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.139
 This is the case Yes I try bike king course bike was enemy happened future 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:11.740
 Its Once you turn pairing soon also it was returned to the Nutra 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.520
 And from here I will rebuild the bike with the power of the accelerator 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.940
 Of this work 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.340
 Planning 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.340
 Exactly why do this all 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.520
 Ne 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.520
 This is a momentary action 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:34.230
 Yes from the soul neutral installed from neutral by 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:37.249
 Say to Tachinaora in the accelerator 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:43.329
 If the rise is slow 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:43.329
 Turn off the opposite handle by 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.210
 Heights 2 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.210
 It is one step ahead a Action is necessary 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.900
 There is a tone that sufficiently decelerated the owner 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.940
 How long do you use the brakes in this straight India 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:09.370
 Also at the 180 degree hairpin corner 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:09.370
 You can achieve fine turning by putting a brake on a regular basis 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:19.460
 Even in this course I put 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:22.030
 You will be able to run, but first of all, have not taken this course on a simpler carpet course. 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:29.220
 Please try 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:29.220
 Practice well and be able to run according to your own Mitsumoto 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.010
