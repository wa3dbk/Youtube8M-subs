00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.580
 power design and modern technology that 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.600
 combines the super sports car from Porsche 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.240
 ferrari and mclaren at just under 1000 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.279
 ps and prices are around a million euros 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.210
 They are easy for many car enthusiasts 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.990
 just a dream 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.220
 the la ferrari of the mclaren 1 and the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.220
 Porsche 918 spyder 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.140
 when it comes to developing new ones 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.960
 Sports car technology is emerson 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.090
 fittipaldi specialist twice 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.160
 Formula 1 world champion from Brazil knows 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.020
 in the scene i know that 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.920
 These cars are very similar to real ones 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.559
 racing cars are 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.600
 I drove together in the clear 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.699
 with the porsche and the ferrari are that 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.050
 the supercars the easy 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.050
 fantastic cars are 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.309
 these are all moving labs with the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
 Combination of internal combustion engine and 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.880
 electric drive 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.869
 that is very efficient and the future 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.479
 of automobile construction makes these 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.830
 Combine the cars faster too 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.900
 nordschleife of the world famous 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.020
 nÃ¼rburgrings a record drive is due 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 porsche with the 918 spyder the record 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 for street legal series vehicles 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.660
 the ambitious goal is clinking for a while 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.120
 under seven minutes on the tax 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.550
 racer marc dear he has as 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.380
 engineer the development of the car 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.140
 co-designed the previous record for 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.560
 the 20 2 kilometer long route lies 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.670
 at 7 minutes and 12 seconds 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 you just have the tension 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.180
 Remembered whole team did not know like that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 exactly what it really is possible with that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.050
 Vehicle can do it under seven 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.300
 minutes for marc dear one not 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.530
 everyday try the successful one 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.600
 driver is at his races 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.480
 usually do not ripen on roads 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.520
 on road 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.990
 for example, at the swedish cross over 300 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 km h the picture has never fallen before 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.280
 also not race car 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.409
 the home of the 918 spyder Zuffenhausen 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.269
 on the edge of stuttgart here is the 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.120
 headquarters of Porsche and here is since 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.459
 over 50 years and the nine elfer built 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.069
 earlier in handwork now also with 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.709
 modern technology 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.599
 around 30,000 elves leave here 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.579
 annually the factory and right next door 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.599
 go piece numbers from the band 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.249
 to suggest something special 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.109
 the manufactory such essential 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.849
 part of making such a car 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.180
 for supercar ratio build the 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.010
 Relatively many cars with 918 pieces it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.989
 but just because of the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.120
 Production concept due to the very very 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.799
 consistent construction of this car 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.370
 really only handcrafted finest 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.109
 leather 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.019
 here only the best suited 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:05.879
 materials are at the heart of the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.919
 eight-cylinder combustion engine is powered by 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:13.319
 a mechanic from start to finish 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:15.659
 assembled alone it takes around 20 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.879
 hours then the engine is ready and 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.939
 waiting inserted by hand to 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.939
 become 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.850
 around 800,000 euros costs the 887 hp 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.290
 strong sports car with special extras 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.110
 to further increase the driving dynamics 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.240
 or a special paint job is fast 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.460
 just under a million euros spent 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.460
 Nevertheless, the car is in great demand 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.030
 Now the day is when we sold out 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.560
 were few days ago they can 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.040
 imagine how many cheers it 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.040
 gave in the team 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.010
 rossmann tombola is a real one 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.770
 sports car fans the top class of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.600
 ferrari mclaren and porsche fascinate 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.190
 he struck him at the 918 spyder 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.500
 Many buyers love the unique 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.450
 engine noise of your sports car him 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.850
 rather excited the silent driving 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.130
 with electric drive what compared to 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.260
 the other supercar just the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.320
 porsche can be something that fascinates me 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.640
 find it that I myself prefer a 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.800
 electronic mailbox 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.930
 which of course is a blatant contradiction to 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.950
 the vehicle as such feels it 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.470
 Hold somewhere else if you actually 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.880
 A future mobile drives something in the car 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.510
 that actually only in 20 years give 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.200
 likely 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.200
 and that's fun 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.530
 also the other manufacturers of 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.240
 supercars rely on hybrid technology 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.740
 small quantities and proud prices 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.030
 middle builds only 375 copies of the p1 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.789
 price from one million euros 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.319
 the ferrari is still around 200,000 euros 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.449
 costs more with only 499 cars and it will 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.889
 more economical hybrid racing cars 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.090
 give 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.180
 Lamborghini now has a study of 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.130
 plug in hybrid asteria presents this 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.720
 car is the first Lamborghini ever 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.690
 the electric drives 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.830
 back to the record attempt of the 918 spyder 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.160
 the clock is running 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.230
 It is necessary to stay under seven minutes 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.890
 Mattli drives last groove and brings everything 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.890
 out of the car 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.190
 and they make it six minutes 57 in 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.890
 record-breaking and technical as well 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.180
 driving top performance 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.430
 hybrid technology seems to be synonymous in the 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.380
 field of supercars enforce 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.490
 the performance of the bolides speaks 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.490
 at least for themselves
