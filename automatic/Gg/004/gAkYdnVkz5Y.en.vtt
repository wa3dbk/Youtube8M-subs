hello<00:00:06.380> folks<00:00:06.710> and<00:00:07.100> welcome<00:00:07.270> to<00:00:08.270> episode<00:00:09.080> 5<00:00:10.330> in

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
hello folks and welcome to episode 5 in

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.170 
hello folks and welcome to episode 5 in
this<00:00:11.450> episode<00:00:11.870> I'm<00:00:12.110> gonna<00:00:12.260> put<00:00:12.590> a<00:00:12.770> SETI<00:00:13.430> motor

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
this episode I'm gonna put a SETI motor

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.019 
this episode I'm gonna put a SETI motor
together<00:00:14.750> obviously<00:00:15.440> with<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:16.220> exception<00:00:16.880> of

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
together obviously with the exception of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.940 
together obviously with the exception of
putting<00:00:17.869> these<00:00:17.990> nitrate<00:00:18.500> because<00:00:18.680> that<00:00:18.830> would

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
putting these nitrate because that would

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.080 
putting these nitrate because that would
just<00:00:19.130> be<00:00:19.310> day<00:00:20.000> in<00:00:20.360> dangerous<00:00:21.759> so<00:00:22.759> the<00:00:22.939> top

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
just be day in dangerous so the top

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.519 
just be day in dangerous so the top
there<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:23.270> can<00:00:23.480> see<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.340> boat<00:00:25.509> tubing<00:00:26.529> then

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
there you can see the boat tubing then

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.190 
there you can see the boat tubing then
the<00:00:27.619> motor<00:00:27.800> itself<00:00:28.369> below<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.270> then<00:00:29.930> the

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
the motor itself below that and then the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.370 
the motor itself below that and then the
delay<00:00:30.470> adjustment<00:00:30.890> all<00:00:31.070> cool<00:00:31.610> so<00:00:32.270> let's<00:00:33.230> put

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
delay adjustment all cool so let's put

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.729 
delay adjustment all cool so let's put
it<00:00:33.470> together

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
it together

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.200 
it together
ok<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:34.760> here<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.930> can<00:00:36.050> see<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.920> high<00:00:37.879> power

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
ok so here you can see the high power

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.680 
ok so here you can see the high power
reloadable<00:00:39.079> rocket<00:00:39.590> motor<00:00:39.829> tube<00:00:40.600> that's<00:00:41.600> a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
reloadable rocket motor tube that's a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.330 
reloadable rocket motor tube that's a
three<00:00:41.899> grain<00:00:42.140> tube<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:42.949> it's<00:00:43.070> got<00:00:43.190> two

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
three grain tube but it's got two

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.729 
three grain tube but it's got two
adapters<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:44.510> you<00:00:44.570> can<00:00:44.780> have<00:00:44.960> one<00:00:45.440> grain

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
adapters in it so you can have one grain

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.400 
adapters in it so you can have one grain
to<00:00:46.070> grain<00:00:46.309> or<00:00:46.609> three<00:00:47.149> grain<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:47.989> see<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.199> most

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
to grain or three grain so see the most

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.150 
to grain or three grain so see the most
from<00:00:48.590> using<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.399> two<00:00:50.059> grain<00:00:50.890> which<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:51.980> see

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
from using is a two grain which you see

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.380 
from using is a two grain which you see
here<00:00:52.399> it's<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.629> white<00:00:53.870> version<00:00:55.030> i'm<00:00:56.030> also<00:00:56.210> got

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
here it's the white version i'm also got

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.829 
here it's the white version i'm also got
a<00:00:56.420> skidmark<00:00:56.960> version<00:00:57.379> as<00:00:57.530> well<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:59.390> as<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.690> can

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
a skidmark version as well so as you can

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.739 
a skidmark version as well so as you can
see<00:01:00.019> you've<00:01:00.440> got<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.649> three<00:01:01.329> sections<00:01:02.329> there

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
see you've got the three sections there

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.630 
see you've got the three sections there
on<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.199> motor<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.309> one<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.210> left<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
on the motor the one on the left is the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.400 
on the motor the one on the left is the
Newton's<00:01:07.640> per<00:01:07.880> second<00:01:08.300> rating<00:01:08.660> of<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.200> motor

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
Newton's per second rating of the motor

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.720 
Newton's per second rating of the motor
the<00:01:09.830> g<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.370> obviously<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.420> size<00:01:12.430> 68<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
the g is obviously the size 68 is the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.330 
the g is obviously the size 68 is the
average<00:01:13.940> thrust<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:15.650> motor<00:01:15.830> produces

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
average thrust the motor produces

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.250 
average thrust the motor produces
throughout<00:01:16.580> its<00:01:16.700> thrust<00:01:16.970> cup<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:17.900> that

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
throughout its thrust cup and then that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.440 
throughout its thrust cup and then that
the<00:01:18.470> third<00:01:18.710> team<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.280> for<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.600> delay<00:01:21.940> so<00:01:22.940> 13<00:01:23.420> is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
the third team is for the delay so 13 is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.280 
the third team is for the delay so 13 is
with<00:01:23.780> much<00:01:24.230> for<00:01:24.890> my<00:01:25.730> rocket<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:26.900> i<00:01:26.930> wanted

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
with much for my rocket so i wanted

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.080 
with much for my rocket so i wanted
between<00:01:27.590> sort<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> seven<00:01:28.520> eight<00:01:28.700> seconds

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
between sort of seven eight seconds

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.720 
between sort of seven eight seconds
either<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.390> those<00:01:29.480> will<00:01:29.720> do<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.860> here<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.310> the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
either of those will do so here is the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.010 
either of those will do so here is the
delay<00:01:32.360> adjustment<00:01:33.140> tool<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.450> as<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.840> can<00:01:35.960> see

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
delay adjustment tool and as you can see

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.350 
delay adjustment tool and as you can see
there<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:36.920> got<00:01:37.190> numerous<00:01:38.000> different

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
there it's got numerous different

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.960 
there it's got numerous different
settings<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:40.130> can<00:01:40.340> take<00:01:40.520> off<00:01:40.700> three

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
settings so you can take off three

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.060 
settings so you can take off three
seconds<00:01:41.450> five<00:01:41.720> seconds<00:01:42.170> seven<00:01:42.530> seconds<00:01:42.860> nine

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
seconds five seconds seven seconds nine

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.700 
seconds five seconds seven seconds nine
seconds<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.540> right<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
seconds and that on the right is the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.280 
seconds and that on the right is the
ring<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.030> centering<00:01:47.390> ring<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:47.900> make<00:01:48.110> sure

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
ring the centering ring so you make sure

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.710 
ring the centering ring so you make sure
you're<00:01:48.500> drilling<00:01:48.800> in<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.610> right<00:01:49.820> place

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
you're drilling in the right place

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.100 
you're drilling in the right place
I<00:01:51.250> am<00:01:52.250> took<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.940> motor<00:01:53.120> out<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.870> cardboard

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
I am took the motor out of the cardboard

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.500 
I am took the motor out of the cardboard
tubing<00:01:54.620> it's<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.220> this<00:01:55.370> nice<00:01:55.610> plastic<00:01:55.970> bag

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
tubing it's in this nice plastic bag

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.960 
tubing it's in this nice plastic bag
here<00:01:56.870> I<00:01:57.020> then<00:01:57.230> removed<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.040> contents<00:01:58.820> and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
here I then removed the contents and

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.740 
here I then removed the contents and
here<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.140> actual<00:02:00.620> motor<00:02:00.830> unit<00:02:01.400> itself<00:02:02.030> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
here is the actual motor unit itself the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.320 
here is the actual motor unit itself the
yellow<00:02:02.990> bit<00:02:03.170> is<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.620> nozzle<00:02:03.920> cap<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.460> then<00:02:05.210> on

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
yellow bit is the nozzle cap and then on

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.320 
yellow bit is the nozzle cap and then on
the<00:02:05.480> right<00:02:05.660> is<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.170> delay<00:02:06.770> section<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.269> took

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
the right is the delay section so I took

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.150 
the right is the delay section so I took
that<00:02:08.629> out<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.959> as<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:09.470> can<00:02:09.590> see<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:09.769> said<00:02:10.009> on

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
that out and as you can see I said on

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.030 
that out and as you can see I said on
minus<00:02:10.550> five<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.870> 13<00:02:12.349> second<00:02:12.800> delay<00:02:13.010> I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
minus five so it's 13 second delay I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.610 
minus five so it's 13 second delay I
wanted<00:02:13.460> eight<00:02:13.640> seconds<00:02:14.210> take<00:02:14.450> five<00:02:14.750> off<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.200> 13

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
wanted eight seconds take five off of 13

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.449 
wanted eight seconds take five off of 13
and<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.040> got<00:02:16.130> eight

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
and you got eight

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.899 
and you got eight
so<00:02:18.090> fairly<00:02:18.390> self-explanatory<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.819> the

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
so fairly self-explanatory and in the

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.319 
so fairly self-explanatory and in the
next<00:02:21.090> picture<00:02:21.209> shows<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:22.170> centering<00:02:23.040> ring<00:02:23.670> in

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
next picture shows the centering ring in

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.990 
next picture shows the centering ring in
the<00:02:24.870> delay<00:02:25.200> adjustment<00:02:25.620> tool<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.000> I've

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the delay adjustment tool and I've

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.809 
the delay adjustment tool and I've
drilled<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.720> out<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.260> safe<00:02:28.590> place<00:02:28.819> and

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
drilled it out in a safe place and

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.660 
drilled it out in a safe place and
disposed<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.420> black<00:02:30.599> powder<00:02:31.489> put<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.579> in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
disposed of the black powder put it in

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.110 
disposed of the black powder put it in
water<00:02:32.849> etc<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.799> now<00:02:35.159> that's<00:02:35.549> taken<00:02:35.909> five

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
water etc so now that's taken five

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
water etc so now that's taken five
seconds<00:02:36.569> off<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.140> delay<00:02:37.409> so<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.769> should

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
seconds off of the delay so now I should

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.470 
seconds off of the delay so now I should
be<00:02:38.010> looking<00:02:38.129> at<00:02:38.400> an<00:02:38.549> eight<00:02:38.760> second<00:02:39.450> delay

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
be looking at an eight second delay

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300 
be looking at an eight second delay
which<00:02:39.870> I'm<00:02:40.049> guessing<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.769> gonna<00:02:41.010> mean<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
which I'm guessing is gonna mean the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.710 
which I'm guessing is gonna mean the
parachutes<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> come<00:02:42.360> out<00:02:42.480> just

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
parachutes going to come out just

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.009 
parachutes going to come out just
slightly<00:02:42.989> after<00:02:43.680> Apogee<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.269> fine

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
slightly after Apogee but that's fine

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.180 
slightly after Apogee but that's fine
the<00:02:46.680> next<00:02:47.310> picture<00:02:47.700> shows<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.629> delay<00:02:49.200> module

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the next picture shows the delay module

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.240 
the next picture shows the delay module
back<00:02:50.370> into<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.420> motor<00:02:51.659> itself<00:02:52.109> that's<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.159> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
back into the motor itself that's on the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.589 
back into the motor itself that's on the
left-hand<00:02:53.670> side<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.239> hand

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
left-hand side and in the right hand

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.580 
left-hand side and in the right hand
side<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.560> nozzle<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.599> then<00:02:57.599> put<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.260> motor

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
side is the nozzle I then put the motor

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.720 
side is the nozzle I then put the motor
back<00:02:59.030> into<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.269> motor<00:03:00.480> casing<00:03:01.730> obviously

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
back into the motor casing obviously

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.449 
back into the motor casing obviously
without<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.970> nozzle<00:03:03.329> protector<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.459> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
without the nozzle protector on and the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.199 
without the nozzle protector on and the
top<00:03:06.420> left<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.370> one<00:03:08.639> of<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.849> spacer

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
top left you can see one of the spacer

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.869 
top left you can see one of the spacer
units<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.950> I've<00:03:11.040> got<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.489> those<00:03:11.609> out

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
units there so I've got one of those out

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.569 
units there so I've got one of those out
as<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.930> only<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.170> two<00:03:13.409> grain<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.129> ones<00:03:14.340> left

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
as this is only a two grain so ones left

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.979 
as this is only a two grain so ones left
in<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.510> provide<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.109> adequate<00:03:16.470> spacing

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
in there to provide the adequate spacing

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.050 
in there to provide the adequate spacing
after<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.109> was<00:03:19.260> all<00:03:19.349> in<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.819> tightened<00:03:20.819> and

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
after that was all in I tightened and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.909 
after that was all in I tightened and
screwed<00:03:21.419> everything<00:03:21.690> up<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.139> as<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.769> can<00:03:22.859> see

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
screwed everything up and as you can see

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.670 
screwed everything up and as you can see
there<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.489> looking<00:03:23.940> pretty<00:03:24.180> mean<00:03:24.690> so

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
there it is looking pretty mean so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.860 
there it is looking pretty mean so
that's<00:03:26.220> gonna<00:03:26.370> get<00:03:26.579> quite<00:03:26.819> hot<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.329> some<00:03:27.629> point

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that's gonna get quite hot at some point

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.920 
that's gonna get quite hot at some point
in<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.139> not-too-distant<00:03:28.769> future<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.750> next

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
in the not-too-distant future the next

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.110 
in the not-too-distant future the next
picture<00:03:31.230> shows<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.530> motor<00:03:32.489> assembly<00:03:32.790> now

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
picture shows the motor assembly now

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.479

altogether<00:03:33.810> with<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.049> nozzle<00:03:34.889> protector<00:03:35.280> cap

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
altogether with the nozzle protector cap

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.869 
altogether with the nozzle protector cap
on<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:35.849> right<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.269> side<00:03:36.840> there<00:03:37.699> just<00:03:38.699> to<00:03:38.760> keep

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
on the right and side there just to keep

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.319 
on the right and side there just to keep
everything<00:03:39.449> protected<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:41.000> after<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.150> I

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
everything protected and after that I

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.330 
everything protected and after that I
put<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.900> into<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.560> business<00:03:43.709> end<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.220> my

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
put it into the business end of my

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.569 
put it into the business end of my
rocket<00:03:45.109> sliding<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.260> right<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.919> motor

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
rocket sliding it right up the motor

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.550 
rocket sliding it right up the motor
retainer<00:03:47.940> tube<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.310> then<00:03:50.310> put<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.560> Rings

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
retainer tube and then put the Rings

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.069 
retainer tube and then put the Rings
back<00:03:52.829> on<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.669> motor<00:03:53.879> retainer<00:03:54.060> screw<00:03:54.660> back<00:03:54.900> on

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
back on the motor retainer screw back on

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.220 
back on the motor retainer screw back on
and<00:03:55.859> then<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.129> cap<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.639> after<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.510> which

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
and then the cap on after that which

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.559 
and then the cap on after that which
will<00:03:58.379> hold<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.889> igniter<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.699> place<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.329> as<00:04:00.540> I

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
will hold the igniter in place and as I

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.110 
will hold the igniter in place and as I
say<00:04:00.780> protects<00:04:01.199> the<00:04:01.409> nozzle<00:04:01.879> so<00:04:02.879> that<00:04:03.000> was

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
say protects the nozzle so that was

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.899 
say protects the nozzle so that was
about<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.359> really<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.109> yeah<00:04:05.099> pretty<00:04:05.459> simple

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
about it really and yeah pretty simple

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.080 
about it really and yeah pretty simple
process<00:04:06.980> okay<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.040> there<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.819> business

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
process okay so there it is the business

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.530 
process okay so there it is the business
end<00:04:09.419> of<00:04:09.540> my<00:04:09.599> rocket<00:04:10.199> ready<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:11.069> hit<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.669> sky<00:04:12.030> oh

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
end of my rocket ready to hit the sky oh

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.189 
end of my rocket ready to hit the sky oh
yeah<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.760> all<00:04:15.299> I've<00:04:15.419> got<00:04:15.449> to<00:04:15.569> do<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.900> put<00:04:16.079> an

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
yeah so all I've got to do is put an

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.860 
yeah so all I've got to do is put an
igniter<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.159> she'll<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.729> obviously<00:04:18.479> as

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
igniter in it and she'll go obviously as

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.240 
igniter in it and she'll go obviously as
I<00:04:18.959> said<00:04:18.989> earlier<00:04:19.349> I'm<00:04:19.409> not<00:04:19.530> putting<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.799> in

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
I said earlier I'm not putting that in

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.450 
I said earlier I'm not putting that in
until<00:04:20.699> she's<00:04:21.389> absolutely<00:04:22.320> ready<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:23.099> go<00:04:23.250> in

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
until she's absolutely ready to go in

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.690 
until she's absolutely ready to go in
the<00:04:23.580> field<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.800> yeah<00:04:25.800> get<00:04:26.340> some<00:04:26.520> decent
