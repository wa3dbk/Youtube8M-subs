00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 d 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:03.810
 Yes 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.710
 it is above all a popular festival 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.360
 yesterday you see in prologue we had a 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.400
 day dedicated to children 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.620
 there were parents the children 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.110
 were happy it was really the party 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.950
 and there we take the measure truly 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.680
 of apparently growing interest 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.830
 includes a population in a city 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.020
 in a Community territory for this 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.160
 kind of manifestation ah bah yes du 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 world happily world case it's going 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.650
 to move a little life is 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.780
 interesting and I was very happy 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 that there is this manifestation at every 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.080
 time is still quite far 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.350
 here it is at the foot of my house 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.350
 Great 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.400
 today finally it's really 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.870
 apparently a public cause for 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.370
 a first edition there are more than 1000 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.400
 participants on the half marathon enough 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.860
 impressive 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.350
 we do this to have fun to go from 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.170
 good time and then do a little party 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.560
 what to cover with the world a lot of 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.960
 world 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.570
 nice weather no rain nice atmosphere 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 super party it will be the end when all 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.520
 the world could arrive addressing this is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.550
 to participate 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.710
 those who train well he can 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.200
 arrive to make 1:30 and after we will say 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.290
 the great mass of French riders 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.120
 yeah it's between and 1:45 two hours and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.660
 I think considering the number 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.880
 registered 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.880
 I think it's going to be a great success 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.420
 you 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 yet we are lucky today 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.850
 it's beautiful we have the sun and besides it 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.370
 is relatively mild so I think 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.640
 runners are spoiled and can 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.740
 establish two beautiful perfs the course and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.630
 is very very flat for doing it and 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.940
 to a few days it's really a 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.080
 very rolling course and that will bring 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.080
 beautiful performances I hope 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.690
 the advantage what we spend in kind is 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.670
 both in town so the natural park 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.100
 urban pastures of which is the largest 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.190
 urban park of ile-de-france has the advantage 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.350
 to pass in this nature in 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.180
 the city of meaux and then we propose 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.800
 also a course here intra muros 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.630
 is very very urban since we pass 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.580
 in front of the main monuments 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.730
 historical city cathedral 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.680
 the ramparts of boulevard jean rose la 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.780
 place henri iv the faubourg saint nicolas 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.780
 and the pedestrian street to finish 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.509
 all in all everything went really well 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.289
 spent a great organization anyway 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.610
 we volunteers 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.160
 we are really happy to have 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.389
 participated in the half marathon of course 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.190
 has made less effort than sanctions 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.110
 incurred but we did it anyway 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.180
 a little bit for them we got 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.410
 a small a small part of the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.120
 volunteers there are all those who are on 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.460
 the terrain that make the traffic 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.389
 there are those who are place henri iv there 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.180
 for the organization 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:18.449
 so it's really a hyper thing 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.449
 important is very complicated to manage 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.500
 it's mostly a great space for 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.970
 recover that frankly it makes the 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.310
 well we do not have that all the breastmilins 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.419
 all the more I do not know in any case me 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.460
 I find that overall it's a lot 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.949
 better than elsewhere however it is 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.240
 their first elsewhere we go away we go 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.759
 quickly take the train the subway a 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.680
 summary a priori everybody stays 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.039
 they have work for the day I 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.039
 believe here 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.380
 m 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.409
 and
