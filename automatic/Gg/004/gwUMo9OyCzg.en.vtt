hiding in plain sight or in plain sight
which<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:04.959> one<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.170> their<00:03:05.290> cards<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.740> play

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
which is one of their cards and play

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.980 
which is one of their cards and play
three<00:03:06.250> more<00:03:06.430> war<00:03:06.640> Raptors<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.300> suddenly

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
three more war Raptors and suddenly

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.570 
three more war Raptors and suddenly
you've<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.350> giant<00:03:08.560> base<00:03:08.830> going<00:03:09.100> on<00:03:09.340> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
you've got this giant base going on and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.670 
you've got this giant base going on and
then<00:03:09.940> finally<00:03:10.330> your<00:03:10.420> Miskatonic<00:03:11.080> Miskatonic

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
then finally your Miskatonic Miskatonic

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.160 
then finally your Miskatonic Miskatonic
is<00:03:12.340> all<00:03:12.610> about<00:03:12.850> manipulation<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.720> madness

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
is all about manipulation of the madness

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.750 
is all about manipulation of the madness
so<00:03:14.620> their<00:03:14.770> most<00:03:14.980> basic<00:03:15.190> guy<00:03:15.430> here<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
so their most basic guy here the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.460 
so their most basic guy here the
researcher<00:03:16.240> takes<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.690> meditite<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.320> may

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
researcher takes on meditite you may

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.990 
researcher takes on meditite you may
draw<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.709> madness<00:03:17.920> card<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.400> get<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.730> draw

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
draw a madness card so you get that draw

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.580 
draw a madness card so you get that draw
two<00:03:19.180> cards<00:03:19.330> now<00:03:19.870> for<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.080> while<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.560> can

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
two cards now for a while and you can

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.560 
two cards now for a while and you can
feel<00:03:20.830> some<00:03:20.980> other<00:03:21.100> stuff<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:22.000> some<00:03:22.450> of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
feel some other stuff and then some of

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.850 
feel some other stuff and then some of
their<00:03:22.660> higher<00:03:22.810> rank<00:03:23.140> ones<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
their higher rank ones like the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.440 
their higher rank ones like the
psychologist<00:03:24.640> will<00:03:24.880> let<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.120> get<00:03:25.269> rid<00:03:25.420> of

psychologist will let you get rid of
your<00:03:25.570> madness<00:03:25.780> start<00:03:26.140> as<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> free<00:03:26.470> action<00:03:26.620> so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
your madness start as a free action so

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.150 
your madness start as a free action so
you<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:27.820> get<00:03:28.209> rid<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.390> one<00:03:28.600> or<00:03:28.810> your

you can just get rid of one or your
professor<00:03:30.160> well<00:03:30.640> let<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.820> take<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> madness<00:03:31.300> to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
professor well let you take a madness to

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.080 
professor well let you take a madness to
take<00:03:31.780> two<00:03:31.930> more<00:03:32.080> actions<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.340> could<00:03:33.580> take

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
take two more actions so you could take

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.440 
take two more actions so you could take
the<00:03:34.239> madness<00:03:34.769> play<00:03:35.769> another<00:03:36.040> guy<00:03:36.269> use<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
the madness play another guy use the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.699 
the madness play another guy use the
other<00:03:37.480> person<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.870> get<00:03:37.989> rid<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.320> madness

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
other person to get rid of the madness

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.740 
other person to get rid of the madness
so<00:03:38.950> now<00:03:39.160> you've<00:03:39.370> bounced<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.060> crazy<00:03:40.480> ass

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
so now you've bounced that crazy ass

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.539 
so now you've bounced that crazy ass
around<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.500> dabbled<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.100> what<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.340> should

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
around and dabbled in what you should

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.860 
around and dabbled in what you should
have<00:03:42.700> gotten<00:03:42.850> some<00:03:43.060> good<00:03:43.150> use<00:03:43.299> out<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.690> but

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
have gotten some good use out of it but

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.940 
have gotten some good use out of it but
you've<00:03:44.019> also<00:03:44.140> gotten<00:03:44.470> rid<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:44.920> you

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
you've also gotten rid of it so you

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.650 
you've also gotten rid of it so you
don't<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.250> worry<00:03:45.430> about<00:03:45.519> engines<00:03:46.420> at<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
don't have to worry about engines at the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.410 
don't have to worry about engines at the
exactly<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.640> one<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.760> concerns<00:03:49.000> some

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
exactly and one of the concerns some

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.380 
exactly and one of the concerns some
smash<00:03:49.989> up<00:03:50.200> fans<00:03:50.410> had<00:03:50.620> was<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:52.120> ability

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
smash up fans had was is this ability

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.820 
smash up fans had was is this ability
going<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.720> make<00:03:52.810> these<00:03:52.959> guys<00:03:53.140> more<00:03:53.410> powerful

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
going to make these guys more powerful

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.370 
going to make these guys more powerful
than<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.010> others<00:03:54.220> in<00:03:54.580> reality<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.480> has<00:03:55.900> not<00:03:56.049> it

is<00:03:56.500> simply<00:03:56.769> another<00:03:56.860> game<00:03:57.370> mechanic<00:03:57.790> vector

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
is simply another game mechanic vector

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.390 
is simply another game mechanic vector
for<00:03:58.299> them<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.510> play<00:03:58.630> on<00:03:58.959> sure<00:03:59.320> we'd<00:04:00.010> never<00:04:00.220> had

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
for them to play on sure we'd never had

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.860 
for them to play on sure we'd never had
a<00:04:00.430> group<00:04:00.670> that<00:04:00.820> could<00:04:00.940> attempt<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.540> actively

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
a group that could attempt to actively

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.300 
a group that could attempt to actively
drag<00:04:02.170> down<00:04:02.350> other<00:04:02.530> people's<00:04:02.650> points<00:04:03.160> so

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
drag down other people's points so

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.830 
drag down other people's points so
that's<00:04:03.519> what<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:04.000> elder<00:04:04.299> things<00:04:04.510> are<00:04:04.600> able<00:04:04.780> to

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
that's what the elder things are able to

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.539 
that's what the elder things are able to
do<00:04:04.989> we<00:04:05.830> haven't<00:04:06.040> had<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> group<00:04:06.370> that's<00:04:06.459> been

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
do we haven't had a group that's been

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.190 
do we haven't had a group that's been
able<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.820> sort<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.030> risk<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.480> loss<00:04:07.630> by<00:04:07.989> being

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
able to sort of risk the loss by being

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.630 
able to sort of risk the loss by being
fast<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.709> that's<00:04:08.890> what<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.070> allows<00:04:09.340> then

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
fast so that's what that allows then

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.729 
fast so that's what that allows then
around<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.000> crazy<00:04:10.390> train<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.019> exactly

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
around that crazy train and exactly

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.650 
around that crazy train and exactly
exactly<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.489> they're<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:13.209> they're<00:04:13.450> fun

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
exactly and they're that they're fun

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.699 
exactly and they're that they're fun

can<00:04:16.479> take<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.140> these<00:04:17.290> guys<00:04:17.470> just<00:04:17.680> fine<00:04:17.950> it's

can take on these guys just fine it's

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.570 
can take on these guys just fine it's
just<00:04:19.060> an<00:04:19.150> all-around<00:04:19.359> fun<00:04:19.720> expansion<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.580> you

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
just an all-around fun expansion it you

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.240 
just an all-around fun expansion it you
know<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.820> even<00:04:22.780> having<00:04:23.289> a<00:04:23.380> theme<00:04:23.650> set<00:04:24.010> like

know it even having a theme set like

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.520 
know it even having a theme set like
this<00:04:24.490> they<00:04:24.700> all<00:04:24.849> play<00:04:25.120> very<00:04:25.360> differently

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
this they all play very differently
