00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
woman at the table so I figured I would

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.540 
woman at the table so I figured I would
ask<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.150> few<00:00:24.420> players<00:00:24.660> advice<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:26.010> playing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
rippling her chips or I will take that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
rippling her chips or I will take that
into<00:00:45.780> consideration<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.950> could<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.399> be

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
into consideration it could just be

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
into consideration it could just be
she's<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.660> tournament<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.379> then

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
she's here for one tournament and then

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.520 
she's here for one tournament and then
you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> play<00:00:50.460> against<00:00:50.789> her<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.149> like

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
you know I play against her just like

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.160 
you know I play against her just like
anyone<00:00:52.530> else<00:00:52.590> -<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.760> think<00:00:53.820> yeah<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
anyone else - I don't think yeah is the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
anyone else - I don't think yeah is the
steak<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.530> poker<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.890> seriously<00:00:56.370> well<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
steak and poker that seriously well I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.180 
steak and poker that seriously well I
think<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.289> women<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.160> be

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
think we all know that women can be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.540 
think we all know that women can be
stubborn<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> would<00:01:00.750> say<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.829> play

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
stubborn so I would say you know play

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
stubborn so I would say you know play
pretty<00:01:02.760> straightforward<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
pretty straightforward with them it's I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.660 
pretty straightforward with them it's I
think<00:01:04.739> people<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> tendency<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.580> get

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
think people have the tendency to get

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
think people have the tendency to get
overly<00:01:06.299> aggressive<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
overly aggressive but you have to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.990 
overly aggressive but you have to
remember<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.490> they're<00:01:08.909> gonna

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
remember that you know they're gonna

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
remember that you know they're gonna
have<00:01:09.119> hands<00:01:09.390> sometimes<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.990> they're<00:01:10.140> just

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
have hands sometimes that they're just

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.140 
have hands sometimes that they're just
not<00:01:10.409> gonna<00:01:10.530> fold<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.310> actually<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
not gonna fold and I actually have a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.270 
not gonna fold and I actually have a
much<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.810> difficult<00:01:13.140> time<00:01:13.770> playing<00:01:14.040> against

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
much more difficult time playing against

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
much more difficult time playing against
women<00:01:14.520> than<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.729> against<00:01:15.119> guys<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
women than I do against guys because I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
women than I do against guys because I
think<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.130> harder<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> read<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.200> they

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
think they're harder to read and they

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
think they're harder to read and they
have<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.470> female<00:01:20.400> instinct<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.150> really

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have that female instinct that really

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
have that female instinct that really
works<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> guys

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
works for them so you know what you guys

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.590 
works for them so you know what you guys
should<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.700> real<00:01:23.880> careful<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.420> there's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
should be real careful when there's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
should be real careful when there's
women<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.930> your<00:01:25.439> table<00:01:26.150> against<00:01:27.150> women<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
women at your table against women I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
women at your table against women I
generally<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
generally if I don't know them I just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
generally if I don't know them I just
assume<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> they're<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> tight<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
assume that they're kind of tight so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.910 
assume that they're kind of tight so
I'll<00:01:32.220> try<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.990> run<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.170> over<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.680> bit

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I'll try to run them over a little bit

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.510 
I'll try to run them over a little bit
but<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.720> they're<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.220> them

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
but if they're you know if I know them

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.399 
but if they're you know if I know them
then<00:01:38.759> they're<00:01:39.150> probably<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:39.600> decent<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
then they're probably pretty decent and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.700 
then they're probably pretty decent and
I<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.280> treat<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.640> any<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.090> player

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
I just treat them like any other player

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.280 
I just treat them like any other player
don't<00:01:43.710> underestimate<00:01:43.979> us<00:01:44.810> I've<00:01:45.810> actually

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
don't underestimate us I've actually

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.649 
don't underestimate us I've actually
built<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.770> big<00:01:46.979> stack<00:01:47.220> today<00:01:47.630> using<00:01:48.630> the
