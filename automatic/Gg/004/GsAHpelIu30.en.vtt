00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.440
 we we're doing a workshop of a 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.760
 3d printer build we have all parts 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.260
 chosen and exposed and 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.119
 also printed so we have 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.830
 actually the whole kit itself 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.150
 put together only has to 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.100
 be screwed together 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.080
 then there is a whole software and 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.930
 electronics history to the hessen 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.460
 is a complicated one and there too 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.440
 for the workshop that we are there 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 support exactly every day early 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.899
 first sudokus in the morning and then the rest 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.829
 This is where it works because you care a lot 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.390
 Well supported it is bad if 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.100
 you do it all by yourself without instructions 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.399
 and for the first time I believe the whole 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.570
 ship 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.810
 I brought my oldest son 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.960
 as a big support 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.600
 get to see the finished bridge and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:21.420
 the two coaches, so to speak, and then 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 be easy to engineer and ask 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 make them with the 3d printer 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.720
 But I mean we print with his 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.509
 printer the parts for my printing on 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.909
 any case that the beautiful is that one 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.110
 digital files in three-dimensional 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.159
 can transform objects 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.690
 this is actually when it yes Sunday 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.009
 you need to assemble it 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.429
 and set a day for him again 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:52.200
 to get on with each other 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.819
 screw and every mother counts 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.240
 In any case, I would say over 100 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:00.200
 is actually only one now 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.060
 afford is not just a fun one 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.030
 can download things from internet 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.409
 There are quite a lot of designs you can do 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.810
 can download and print 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.510
 that's fun and if you yourself 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.180
 in drawing with 3d home is coming 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.780
 Also everything you need in the house can 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.100
 you draw and print and that the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.100
 is sometimes practical but mostly was 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.670
 very fun this workshop is the first 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.550
 times before that actually everyone at the beginning 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.700
 to make a month in berlin 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.910
 so there is always room for 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.910
 interested people
