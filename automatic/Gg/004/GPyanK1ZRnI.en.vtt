00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hi there, UTB room, and now 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.590
 and video review if samson microphone 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.210
 meteor mic 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.800
 it comes in such here 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 beautiful little black box behind 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.810
 we can see that the microphone has 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:31.170
 most precisely 25 millimeters 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:34.489
 network aperture quality 16 bit and connector 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 for monitoring and connecting headphones 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.680
 pretty box included 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.899
 Delivery is such a case 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 for storage and transportation and usb 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.610
 such cable 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.590
 not solid and looks like something I do not know 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:05.460
 sluggish if you compare with cable mxl yusbi 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 006 then Excel more solid cable with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 the microphone at first glance leaves 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.710
 pleasant sensations it is covered with double 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.689
 word chrome has a mount for 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.689
 racks of usual standard racks 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 here you can see the adjustment wheel 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:35.479
 volume monitoring site has it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.990
 headphone jack and 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 usb outs microphone shine 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.570
 flashlight failed to peek 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:53.399
 his inner world and convince him 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:58.670
 diaphragm here for example mixer lesbian 06 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:02.250
 see yes gold 22 millimeter and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.649
 visible and that is if you look at the light 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.599
 you can see the whole capsule here generally not be 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:17.340
 may not transmit light at all but there is 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:20.610
 a small plus he is not so afraid bp 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.050
 and does not need much pop filter and then 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.390
 there is if use it for skype for 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.760
 podcast then by filter you don't need 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.060
 appearance if we compare the size and 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.550
 dimensions samson meteor mic back sergiyu 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 6 then the samsung sensor will of course 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.140
 significantly less 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 it is already assembled as if 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.319
 as much fat and mixer without persistent 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.980
 quite large in terms of quality 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.319
 sound sound quality is acceptable that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.440
 concerns monitoring monitoring this 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.159
 models that are direct without participation 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.970
 computer in this whole thing 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.220
 directly to the microphone itself 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.230
 heading towards you without headphones 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.540
 any delays meaning you can 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.940
 talk sing read do anything and 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.610
 hear yourself in headphones without any 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.519
 delays and have dance because if 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.120
 monitoring is late you can 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.230
 ruin oneself by drink 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.920
 as for the appearance of all of course 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.519
 love this kind of microphones 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.239
 are we stream old school though they and 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:47.159
 confusing even this rather Samson such 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.220
 retro style is more familiar to us all 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.909
 view microphone principle our review can 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.950
 to finish 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.860
 the smallest test of this 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.330
 hello everyone hi this is the test 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.230
 samsung meteor mic 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.019
 and in this part of the review I want to tell 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.610
 microphone and you listen to him at the same time 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.970
 sounds like he writes sound 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.890
 I want to note that the microphone is 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.189
 In principle, an excellent ratio 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.100
 price-quality for the money that he 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:19.380
 it costs and it costs about 950 hryvnia in 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.510
 Ukraine for the money doing 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.880
 monitoring without delay you get 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.640
 pretty sound quality and mobile 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.420
 compact stylish and beautiful reliable 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.700
 at the same time microphone sound he writes you 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.910
 you can hear yes in moderation 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.810
 he hears both low frequencies and 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.910
 high 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.790
 unlike m xl 006 he writes more like that 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.430
 say a narrow sound that is narrower 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.040
 range from there above about microphone to zero 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.740
 zero sixth he writes more pure and 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.400
 transparent sound but basically he and 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.850
 worth more good microphone advise in 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.490
 principle if you have a limited budget 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.980
 you can buy yourself only microphones and 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.150
 make quite high-quality tracks 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.720
 with the proper level of information thank you all 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.720
 for your attention
