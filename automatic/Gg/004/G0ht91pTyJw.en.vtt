 Ice Kingdom.This music does not fit at all, does not fit there, does not sit there in the movie. It reminds the lion king. 

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:23.901
 He will be okay. 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
 But ... will he not remember that I have the strength? 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
 It'll be the best. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:43.100
 Listen to me, Elza. Your strength will only grow. There is beauty in it. But also a great danger. You have to learn to control it. Fear will be your enemy. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.000
 So ... you mean to lock her in the castle to make sure nothing happens? 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
 What? I don't mean to say that, that's nonsense, no. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.800
 So ... do you mean to educate her to be frightened of her? 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 Are you listening to me at all? I said "fear will be your enemy". 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 So ... do you mean to teach her to keep all feelings inside her until she gets a complex of freedom? And just wait for it to get through the force thing? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.800
 Well, you two are terrible parents. No, I don't want you to do any of it. 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.000
 So ... you want to say ... 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.300
 Stop saying "takÅ¾eeeee" ... Every time you say so, you say nonsense. 

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:19.774
 Hide feelings? 

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:31.300
 My God, the answer is LOVE. Clearly? True love heals. All right, just come with me. I'll show you one place. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 My name is Charles Xavier. Welcome to my gifted school. 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 Suddenly, suddenly, I slam the door behind me. I am mine. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.000
 I am mine, 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.800
 My wings are my wings. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.400
 Blooming in the storm. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.900
 I want to live my life in the winter without end.
