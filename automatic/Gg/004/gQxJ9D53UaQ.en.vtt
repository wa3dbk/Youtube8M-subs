comparing<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:19.830> shoes<00:01:20.070> using<00:01:20.460> two

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
comparing the two shoes using two

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.230 
comparing the two shoes using two
categories<00:01:21.240> performance<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> style<00:01:22.830> and

categories performance and style and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
whichever eye at the end of it I say

which shoe I prefer for each category

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.539

sometimes<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> two<00:01:28.740> shoes<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.340> one

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
sometimes the two shoes would get one

sometimes the two shoes would get one
and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.290> how<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> turns<00:01:31.710> out

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the cushion I feel like the cushion

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.569 
the cushion I feel like the cushion
could<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.329> been<00:01:42.420> better<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> kt5<00:01:43.549> when<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
could have been better in the kt5 when I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.940 
could have been better in the kt5 when I
play<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.180> after<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.170> after<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.740> take

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
play in these after like after I take

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.530 
play in these after like after I take
them<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.280> they<00:01:47.520> feel<00:01:47.970> fine<00:01:48.240> while<00:01:48.479> I'm

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
them off they feel fine while I'm

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
them off they feel fine while I'm
playing<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.079> I'd<00:01:50.070> say<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.369> half<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.850> hour

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
playing but I'd say about half an hour

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
playing but I'd say about half an hour
after<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.689> off<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:52.020> heel<00:01:52.290> starts<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
after I take them off my heel starts to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
after I take them off my heel starts to
hurt<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.759> sure<00:01:53.970> whether<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
hurt and I'm not sure whether it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.840 
hurt and I'm not sure whether it's
because<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> cushion<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> heel<00:01:56.340> or

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
because of the cushion in the heel or

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.800 
because of the cushion in the heel or
because<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.360> provide<00:01:57.750> enough

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
because they don't provide enough

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.929 
because they don't provide enough
support<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.490> me

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
support but that's just me

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
support but that's just me
everyone<00:02:00.360> else<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.719> I've<00:02:00.840> talked<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> about

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
everyone else that I've talked to about

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.709 
everyone else that I've talked to about
that<00:02:01.500> problem<00:02:02.040> hasn't<00:02:02.490> had<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.880> problem<00:02:03.299> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that problem hasn't had that problem so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.970 
that problem hasn't had that problem so
I'm<00:02:04.229> guessing<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:05.040> me<00:02:05.219> but

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
I'm guessing it's just me but

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.490 
I'm guessing it's just me but
to<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.400> aware<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:07.330> far<00:02:07.630> as<00:02:07.780> style<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.410> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
to be aware of as far as style in the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.800 
to be aware of as far as style in the
kt5<00:02:09.040> these<00:02:09.730> are<00:02:09.880> definitely<00:02:10.180> a<00:02:10.330> really<00:02:10.600> nice

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
kt5 these are definitely a really nice

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.870 
kt5 these are definitely a really nice
shoe<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.440> feel<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.370> they're<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.550> little<00:02:12.700> bit

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
shoe I feel like they're a little bit

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.260 
shoe I feel like they're a little bit
more<00:02:13.090> wearable<00:02:13.420> than<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.020> kt6<00:02:14.590> because

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
more wearable than the kt6 because

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.390 
more wearable than the kt6 because
they're<00:02:16.270> just<00:02:16.540> they're<00:02:16.960> they're<00:02:17.500> more<00:02:17.740> plain

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
they're just they're they're more plain

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.430 
they're just they're they're more plain
looking<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.970> mean<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.210> kt6<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.900> pretty<00:02:20.170> crazy

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
looking I mean the kt6 is pretty crazy

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.040 
looking I mean the kt6 is pretty crazy
it's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.340> low<00:02:21.520> top<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.150> weird<00:02:22.420> shape<00:02:22.750> you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
it's a low top it's a weird shape you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.870 
it's a low top it's a weird shape you
know<00:02:23.140> it's<00:02:23.290> kind<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.500> futuristic<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.430> then

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
know it's kind of futuristic and then

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.930 
know it's kind of futuristic and then
the<00:02:25.000> kt5<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> really<00:02:26.350> chill

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the kt5 is just like a really chill

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.060 
the kt5 is just like a really chill
casual<00:02:27.940> sneaker<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.350> feel<00:02:29.710> like<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.950> is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
casual sneaker so I feel like this is

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.040 
casual sneaker so I feel like this is
more<00:02:30.190> wearable<00:02:30.520> than<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.060> kd6<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.020> I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
more wearable than the kd6 but I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.930 
more wearable than the kd6 but I
definitely<00:02:32.560> do<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.070> look<00:02:33.250> at<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.460> kd6

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
definitely do like the look at the kd6

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.980 
definitely do like the look at the kd6
as<00:02:34.150> well<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.140> leads<00:02:35.350> me<00:02:35.470> into<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:36.190> kd6

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
as well so that leads me into the kd6

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.660 
as well so that leads me into the kd6
performance-wise<00:02:37.990> these<00:02:38.950> were<00:02:39.130> very<00:02:39.400> good

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
performance-wise these were very good

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.540 
performance-wise these were very good
the<00:02:40.030> traction<00:02:40.540> was<00:02:40.690> not<00:02:40.930> as<00:02:41.110> good<00:02:41.380> as<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.890> kt5

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
the traction was not as good as the kt5

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.120 
the traction was not as good as the kt5
but<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.450> cushioning<00:02:43.960> was<00:02:44.200> way<00:02:44.590> better

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
but the cushioning was way better

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.150 
but the cushioning was way better
I<00:02:45.160> feel<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.560> file<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.740> foam<00:02:48.010> that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
I feel like this this file on foam that

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.830 
I feel like this this file on foam that
they<00:02:48.310> used<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.790> midsole<00:02:49.180> was<00:02:49.360> just<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.660> lot

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
they used in the midsole was just a lot

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.820 
they used in the midsole was just a lot
softer<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.820> really<00:02:52.410> personally<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.590> felt

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
softer and it really personally it felt

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.530 
softer and it really personally it felt
a<00:02:53.950> lot<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.220> comfortable<00:02:54.550> than<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.060> KD<00:02:55.330> 5

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
a lot more comfortable than the KD 5

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.540 
a lot more comfortable than the KD 5
plus<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.410> don't<00:02:56.620> experience<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.190> heel

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
plus I don't experience that heel

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.700 
plus I don't experience that heel
problem<00:02:58.030> they<00:02:58.660> did<00:02:58.840> increase<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> size<00:02:59.500> in

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
problem they did increase the size in

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.710 
problem they did increase the size in
the<00:02:59.800> air<00:02:59.950> bag<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.550> I'm<00:03:00.910> guessing<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.420> might

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
the air bag so I'm guessing that might

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.900 
the air bag so I'm guessing that might
be<00:03:01.900> what's<00:03:02.110> wrong<00:03:02.290> with<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> kt<00:03:02.800> 5<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:03.760> it's

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
be what's wrong with the kt 5 but it's

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.010 
be what's wrong with the kt 5 but it's
not<00:03:04.060> too<00:03:04.240> big<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.630> deal

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
not too big of a deal

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.140 
not too big of a deal
and<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.320> are<00:03:05.620> sacrificing<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.760> ankle

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
and you are sacrificing that ankle

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.360 
and you are sacrificing that ankle
support<00:03:07.270> with<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> low<00:03:07.960> top<00:03:08.260> shoe<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:09.160> i

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
support with the low top shoe but i

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.520 
support with the low top shoe but i
really<00:03:09.820> really<00:03:09.850> like<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.510> now<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:11.080> far<00:03:11.290> as<00:03:11.350> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
really really like it now as far as the

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.300 
really really like it now as far as the
kd6<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.220> styled<00:03:12.760> i<00:03:12.910> know<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.300> lot<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.750> people

that<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.050> looked<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.320> soccer<00:03:17.709> cleat

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
that it looked like a soccer cleat
