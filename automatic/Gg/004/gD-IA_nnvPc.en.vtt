difference between widgets and live
tiles<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.070> which<00:02:50.190> one<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:50.580> better

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
tiles in which one you like better

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.700

I like the selection of widgets that are

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.930 
I like the selection of widgets that are
available<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.190> little<00:02:53.430> bit<00:02:53.520> better<00:02:53.670> than<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
available a little bit better than the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.060 
available a little bit better than the
options<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.630> live<00:02:54.780> tiles<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.890> little

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
options for live tiles and it's a little

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.680 
options for live tiles and it's a little
easier<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> search<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.940> them<00:02:57.090> versus<00:02:57.360> trying

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
easier to search for them versus trying

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.570 
easier to search for them versus trying
to<00:02:57.780> search<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:57.960> live<00:02:58.320> tiles<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.310> wraps

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
you get with the Windows Phone is that

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.370 
you get with the Windows Phone is that
it<00:05:59.430> has<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.880> try<00:06:00.390> option<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.020> if<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.170> go<00:06:01.290> into

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
it has a try option so if you go into

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.040 
it has a try option so if you go into
Angry<00:06:01.710> Birds<00:06:01.890> here<00:06:02.100> which<00:06:02.250> costs<00:06:02.670> $0.99<00:06:03.540> you

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
Angry Birds here which costs $0.99 you

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.960 
Angry Birds here which costs $0.99 you
can<00:06:04.200> actually<00:06:04.350> try<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:04.920> before<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.460> buy<00:06:05.580> it

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
can actually try it before you buy it

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.880 
can actually try it before you buy it
so<00:06:06.660> I<00:06:06.690> think<00:06:06.780> that's<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.080> very<00:06:07.230> nice<00:06:07.350> option<00:06:07.740> so

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
so I think that's a very nice option so

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.320 
so I think that's a very nice option so
you<00:06:07.950> can<00:06:08.100> try<00:06:08.250> out<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.400> game<00:06:08.610> or<00:06:08.730> an<00:06:08.820> application

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
you can try out a game or an application

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.180 
you can try out a game or an application
to<00:06:09.750> see<00:06:09.900> if<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.110> actually<00:06:10.320> works<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:11.040> does

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
to see if it actually works and does

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.100

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
I think the Windows Phone 8 operating

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.719 
I think the Windows Phone 8 operating
system<00:07:30.349> is<00:07:30.680> a<00:07:30.710> very<00:07:30.889> good<00:07:31.039> operating<00:07:31.430> system

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729 
system is a very good operating system

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.610 
system is a very good operating system
it<00:07:32.060> might<00:07:32.330> be<00:07:32.479> a<00:07:32.509> good<00:07:32.750> intermediate<00:07:33.380> step

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
it might be a good intermediate step

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.620 
it might be a good intermediate step
between<00:07:34.039> an<00:07:34.370> iPhone<00:07:34.820> to<00:07:35.180> an<00:07:35.270> Android<00:07:35.509> phone

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630 
between an iPhone to an Android phone

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.839 
between an iPhone to an Android phone
it's<00:07:36.199> very<00:07:36.470> intuitive<00:07:36.800> and<00:07:37.039> very<00:07:37.190> easy<00:07:37.400> to<00:07:37.610> use

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:37.849 
it's very intuitive and very easy to use

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.909 
it's very intuitive and very easy to use
and<00:07:38.120> it<00:07:38.449> might<00:07:38.630> lend<00:07:38.840> itself<00:07:39.110> to<00:07:39.380> a<00:07:39.409> first-time

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919
