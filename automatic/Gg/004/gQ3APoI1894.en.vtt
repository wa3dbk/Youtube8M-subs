oven it's revolutionary infrared cooking
system<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.609> the<00:00:17.609> way<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
system and the way that I have this

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.970 
system and the way that I have this
camera<00:00:18.570> positioned<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.890> very

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
camera positioned is is that it's very

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.439 
camera positioned is is that it's very
far<00:00:20.340> away<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> picture

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
far away so that you can get a picture

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.490 
far away so that you can get a picture
of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.289> unit<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.810> extender

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
of the unit I do not have the extender

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.410 
of the unit I do not have the extender
piece<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> another

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
piece on it but there is another

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
piece on it but there is another
extender<00:00:28.019> piece<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.590> will<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> lot

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
extender piece that will make this a lot

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.189 
extender piece that will make this a lot
taller<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> could<00:00:30.630> maybe<00:00:30.810> cook<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
taller so that you could maybe cook a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.810 
taller so that you could maybe cook a
turkey<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> or<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.489> large<00:00:33.149> ham<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.700> we

have here is the new wave oven and this

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.740 
have here is the new wave oven and this
is<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> revolutionary<00:00:40.649> oven<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.420> what<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> does

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
is a revolutionary oven and what it does

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.900 
is a revolutionary oven and what it does
is<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.829> cooks<00:00:44.219> by<00:00:44.399> infrared<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:46.039> it<00:00:47.039> cooks<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
is it cooks by infrared and it cooks the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
is it cooks by infrared and it cooks the
food<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.079> doesn't<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.500> dried<00:00:49.800> out

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
food so that it doesn't get dried out

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.619 
food so that it doesn't get dried out
now<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.850> times<00:00:51.090> you'll<00:00:51.270> cook<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.539> an

oven and your food will become really
dried<00:00:54.239> out

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
dried out

dried out
and<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.440> won't<00:00:55.620> find<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> case

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and you won't find that to be the case

and you won't find that to be the case
with<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> new<00:00:57.149> wave<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.980> new<00:00:59.129> wave<00:00:59.340> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
with the new wave the new wave is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.130 
with the new wave the new wave is
healthier<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.460> much

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
healthier because you don't get as much

going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.600> how<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.140> works<00:01:07.290> by

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
going to show you how that works by

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
going to show you how that works by
lifting<00:01:07.979> off<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.159> dome<00:01:08.640> okay<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
lifting off the dome okay this is the
dome<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> lifts<00:01:11.159> off<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.710> okay<00:01:13.710> now

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
dome and it lifts off like this okay now

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.999 
dome and it lifts off like this okay now
we'll<00:01:14.580> set<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> dorm<00:01:15.150> dome<00:01:15.450> aside<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> we

this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> grease<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this is where all the grease is going to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.390 
this is where all the grease is going to
go<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:39.000> sits<00:01:39.720> below<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> rack<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
go and it sits below the rack so that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.690 
go and it sits below the rack so that

all<00:04:04.330> goes<00:04:04.540> down<00:04:04.810> into<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.200> pan<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:06.760> makes

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
all goes down into the pan and it makes

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.370 
all goes down into the pan and it makes
it<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.330> little<00:04:07.570> bit<00:04:07.720> healthier<00:04:08.200> for<00:04:08.560> you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
it a little bit healthier for you

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.050 
it a little bit healthier for you
and<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.620> also<00:04:09.770> uses<00:04:10.130> less<00:04:10.280> power<00:04:10.670> than<00:04:11.000> a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and it also uses less power than a

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.120 
and it also uses less power than a
conventional<00:04:11.330> oven<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.740> does<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.100> same

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
conventional oven but it does the same

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.850 
conventional oven but it does the same
thing<00:04:13.520> as<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> conventional<00:04:14.360> oven<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.410> this<00:04:15.740> is

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
thing as a conventional oven so this is

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.710 
thing as a conventional oven so this is
what<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.040> wanted<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.459> introduce<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.270> you<00:04:17.390> is<00:04:17.600> the

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
what I wanted to introduce to you is the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.960 
what I wanted to introduce to you is the
new<00:04:18.260> wave<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.280> what<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.520> looks<00:04:19.730> like

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
new wave and this is what it looks like

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.200 
new wave and this is what it looks like
it's<00:04:20.660> very<00:04:21.470> lightweight<00:04:21.800> as<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.640> can<00:04:22.820> see<00:04:23.030> you

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
it's very lightweight as you can see you

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.830 
it's very lightweight as you can see you
can<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:23.390> lift<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.870> up<00:04:24.160> it's<00:04:25.160> not<00:04:25.400> heavy<00:04:25.840> you

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
can just lift it up it's not heavy you

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.210 
can just lift it up it's not heavy you
don't<00:04:26.960> have<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.380> worry<00:04:27.590> about<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.980> being<00:04:28.130> too

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
don't have to worry about it being too

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.520 
don't have to worry about it being too
heavy<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:30.050> said<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.350> does<00:04:30.500> have

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
heavy and it like I said it does have

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.620 
heavy and it like I said it does have
the<00:04:30.830> extender<00:04:31.340> ring<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.270> could<00:04:32.450> cook

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
the extender ring so that you could cook

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.560 
the extender ring so that you could cook
like<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.900> turkey<00:04:33.350> in<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.210> what<00:04:35.480> it

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
like a turkey in it so this is what it

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.030 
like a turkey in it so this is what it
looks<00:04:35.780> like<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.260> I'm<00:04:36.350> going<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.770> be<00:04:36.890> doing

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
just I know that this video reviews a

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.610 
just I know that this video reviews a
little<00:05:11.450> bit<00:05:11.540> different<00:05:11.960> because<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.320> camera

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
little bit different because the camera

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.020 
little bit different because the camera
had<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.860> be<00:05:12.950> positioned<00:05:13.430> farther<00:05:13.760> away<00:05:13.880> so

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
had to be positioned farther away so

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.150 
had to be positioned farther away so
that<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.420> could<00:05:14.570> see<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.750> whole<00:05:14.960> picture<00:05:15.170> but

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
that you could see the whole picture but

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.580 
that you could see the whole picture but
that's<00:05:16.370> what<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.610> wanted<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.000> show<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:17.720> I

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
that's what I wanted to show you and I

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.310 
that's what I wanted to show you and I
hope<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.190> have<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.400> look<00:05:19.580> at<00:05:19.730> my<00:05:19.880> other<00:05:20.320> chicken
