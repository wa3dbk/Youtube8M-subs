okay<00:00:00.390> so<00:00:00.450> today<00:00:00.989> what<00:00:01.319> we've<00:00:01.530> got<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.190> the

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
okay so today what we've got is the

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay so today what we've got is the
shurflo<00:00:04.290> reservoir<00:00:05.089> accumulator<00:00:06.089> it's<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
shurflo reservoir accumulator it's a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.860 
shurflo reservoir accumulator it's a
little<00:00:07.259> cumulate<00:00:08.130> er<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.940> goes<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.389> your<00:00:09.420> RV

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
little cumulate er that goes in your RV

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.430 
little cumulate er that goes in your RV
pump<00:00:12.870> system<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.210> stop<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.480> air<00:00:15.630> hammer<00:00:15.960> and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
pump system to stop the air hammer and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.660 
pump system to stop the air hammer and
our<00:00:16.890> water<00:00:17.190> hammer

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
our water hammer

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.359 
our water hammer
I<00:00:17.789> guess<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.070> thumping<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I guess you say and the thumping that it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.009 
I guess you say and the thumping that it
causes<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.000> also<00:00:22.490> will<00:00:23.490> hopefully<00:00:24.180> keep<00:00:24.689> it

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
causes it also will hopefully keep it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.999 
causes it also will hopefully keep it
from<00:00:25.350> cycling<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.609> often<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.070> basically

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
from cycling so often and it basically

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
from cycling so often and it basically
saves<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.189> system<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.630> knocking

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
saves your system from the knocking

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.750 
saves your system from the knocking
around<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> usually<00:00:35.130> does<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.640> those

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
around that it usually does with those

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.100 
around that it usually does with those
little<00:00:36.000> pumps<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.660> put<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.989> these

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
little pumps that they put in these

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.700 
little pumps that they put in these
things<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:42.379> 182

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
things so this is just a this is the 182

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.049 
things so this is just a this is the 182
-<00:00:44.430> 200<00:00:45.120> model<00:00:45.539> number<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:47.010> comes<00:00:47.280> pre<00:00:47.730> charged

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
- 200 model number it comes pre charged

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750 
- 200 model number it comes pre charged
with<00:00:48.239> 30<00:00:48.450> psi<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> accumulator<00:00:49.920> I've

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
with 30 psi in the accumulator I've

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850 
with 30 psi in the accumulator I've
checked<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.210> setting<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.230> top<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
checked that setting on top of the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
checked that setting on top of the
counter<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.670> directly<00:00:54.149> over<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.870> my

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
counter which is directly over where my

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.279 
counter which is directly over where my
water<00:00:55.350> pump<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.809> now<00:00:57.809> we're<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> see

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
water pump is and now we're going to see

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.170 
water pump is and now we're going to see
maybe<00:00:58.920> it'll<00:00:59.129> transfer<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> sound<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
maybe it'll transfer the sound and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
maybe it'll transfer the sound and
vibration<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> camera

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
vibration a little bit up to the camera

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:32.840 
vibration a little bit up to the camera
just<00:01:02.359> just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.050 

okay<00:01:33.850> so<00:01:33.910> here's<00:01:34.360> my<00:01:34.450> setup<00:01:35.110> inside<00:01:36.060> my

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
okay so here's my setup inside my

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.990 
okay so here's my setup inside my
existing<00:01:37.630> confident<00:01:38.200> I've<00:01:38.290> got<00:01:38.760> some<00:01:39.760> tie

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
existing confident I've got some tie

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.850 
existing confident I've got some tie
wraps<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.570> stuff<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.020> I'd<00:01:41.170> put<00:01:41.470> on<00:01:41.620> there

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
wraps and stuff that I'd put on there

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.670 
wraps and stuff that I'd put on there
previously<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.090> wouldn't<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:44.440> pipes

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
previously so it wouldn't the pipes

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.410 
previously so it wouldn't the pipes
wouldn't<00:01:45.100> sit<00:01:45.250> there<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.520> rattled<00:01:45.940> against

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
wouldn't sit there and rattled against

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.770 
wouldn't sit there and rattled against
each<00:01:46.570> other<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.760> what<00:01:49.030> I'm<00:01:49.150> thinking<00:01:49.180> I'm

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
each other and so what I'm thinking I'm

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.510 
each other and so what I'm thinking I'm
going<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:49.990> do<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.470> just<00:01:50.800> mount<00:01:51.220> this<00:01:51.460> thing

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
going to do is just mount this thing

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.480 
going to do is just mount this thing
about<00:01:52.090> right<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.860> cat<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.280> comes

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
about right here in the cat it comes

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.950 
about right here in the cat it comes
with<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.820> little<00:01:58.680> connector<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.750> take

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
with a little connector so you can take

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.859 
with a little connector so you can take
off<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:03.280> inlet<00:02:03.670> here<00:02:04.320> excuse<00:02:05.320> me<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.710> outlet

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
off the inlet here excuse me the outlet

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.560 
off the inlet here excuse me the outlet
into<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.550> hose<00:02:09.820> will

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
into here and then this hose will

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.400 
into here and then this hose will
connect<00:02:11.110> over<00:02:11.380> here<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:11.830> side<00:02:13.260> should<00:02:14.260> be

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
connect over here to this side should be

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.520 
connect over here to this side should be
a<00:02:14.440> real<00:02:14.709> easy<00:02:15.040> simple<00:02:15.760> thing<00:02:16.090> okay<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.290> I've

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
a real easy simple thing okay so I've

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.090 
a real easy simple thing okay so I've
installed<00:02:18.630> accumulator

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
installed accumulator

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.100 
installed accumulator
I've<00:02:21.100> pressure<00:02:21.850> tested<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:24.630> got<00:02:25.630> most<00:02:25.870> of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
I've pressure tested it and got most of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.800 
I've pressure tested it and got most of
the<00:02:27.630> air<00:02:28.630> out<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.200> system<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.630> looks

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the air out of the system so it looks

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.880 
the air out of the system so it looks
like<00:02:31.959> we're<00:02:32.140> ready<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.590> test<00:02:34.680> I'm<00:02:35.680> going<00:02:35.799> to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
like we're ready for a test I'm going to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.000 
like we're ready for a test I'm going to
go<00:02:36.010> ahead<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.340> turn<00:02:36.519> on<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.670> water<00:02:38.010> we'll

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
go ahead and turn on the water we'll

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.860 
go ahead and turn on the water we'll
have<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.280> run<00:02:39.519> here<00:02:39.790> for<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> second<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.690> can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
have it run here for a second you can

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:55.440 
have it run here for a second you can
see<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.260> pump<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.980> stuff

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.160 

I<00:02:56.849> noticed<00:02:57.849> it<00:02:58.000> does<00:02:58.180> take<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> little<00:02:58.690> longer

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
I noticed it does take a little longer

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.040 
I noticed it does take a little longer
for<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.769> charge<00:03:00.550> back<00:03:00.910> up<00:03:00.940> after<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.810> turn

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
for it to charge back up after you turn

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.410 
for it to charge back up after you turn
the<00:03:02.200> faucet<00:03:02.440> off<00:03:02.769> but<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> also<00:03:03.940> takes<00:03:04.300> a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the faucet off but it also takes a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.710 
the faucet off but it also takes a
little<00:03:04.569> bit<00:03:04.750> longer<00:03:05.019> for<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:07.180> pump<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.540> come

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
little bit longer for the pump to come

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.670 
little bit longer for the pump to come
on<00:03:09.000> because<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> accumulator<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.530> it's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
on because of the accumulator but it's

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.670 
on because of the accumulator but it's
definitely<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.540> little<00:03:13.540> bit<00:03:13.780> quieter<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.620> a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
definitely a little bit quieter and a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.309 
definitely a little bit quieter and a
lot<00:03:15.400> less<00:03:15.610> thumping<00:03:16.120> okay<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.569> here<00:03:17.050> we<00:03:17.170> have

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
lot less thumping okay so here we have

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.690 
lot less thumping okay so here we have
the<00:03:17.500> after<00:03:17.680> test<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:19.239> I've<00:03:19.989> already

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the after test and I've already

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.120 
the after test and I've already
installed<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.970> accumulator<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:24.010> is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
installed the accumulator and this is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.630 
installed the accumulator and this is
basically<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.670> same<00:03:24.910> position<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:26.519> we<00:03:27.519> were

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
basically the same position that we were

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.449 
basically the same position that we were
at<00:03:27.790> before<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.530> I'll<00:03:29.620> go<00:03:29.799> ahead<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.130> turn<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
at before and I'll go ahead and turn the

00:03:30.459 --> 00:04:14.490 
at before and I'll go ahead and turn the
water<00:03:30.640> on<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:39.250> now<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.430> pump<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:39.849> kicked<00:03:40.120> in

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.430 

and<00:04:15.500> another<00:04:15.799> pump<00:04:16.070> is<00:04:16.190> off<00:04:18.070> my<00:04:19.070> opinion<00:04:20.440> it's

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
and another pump is off my opinion it's

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
and another pump is off my opinion it's
probably<00:04:21.949> worth<00:04:22.240> $44<00:04:23.240> or<00:04:23.479> $50<00:04:24.259> if<00:04:24.889> you<00:04:25.100> install

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
probably worth $44 or $50 if you install

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.879 
probably worth $44 or $50 if you install
it<00:04:25.580> yourself<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:26.259> don't<00:04:27.259> know<00:04:27.380> if<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.620> have<00:04:27.770> to

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
it yourself I don't know if you have to

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.310 
it yourself I don't know if you have to
have<00:04:28.009> somebody<00:04:28.250> else<00:04:28.400> install<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.000> for<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.360> it

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
have somebody else install it for you it

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.960 
have somebody else install it for you it
would<00:04:30.500> be<00:04:30.680> worth<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.100> me<00:04:31.340> or<00:04:31.460> not<00:04:31.610> I'm<00:04:31.940> not

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
would be worth it to me or not I'm not

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.420 
would be worth it to me or not I'm not
sure<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.750> did<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.169> myself<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.039> was<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> very

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
sure I did it myself and it was a very

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.400 
sure I did it myself and it was a very
simple<00:04:34.789> task<00:04:35.090> if<00:04:35.449> you<00:04:35.600> need<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:35.900> just<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.169> rent

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
simple task if you need you just to rent

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.129 
simple task if you need you just to rent
something<00:04:36.860> real<00:04:37.039> quick<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:38.240> know<00:04:38.360> it's<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
something real quick you know it's the

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.450 
something real quick you know it's the
pump<00:04:39.380> still<00:04:39.620> off<00:04:40.210> pump<00:04:41.210> still<00:04:41.479> off<00:04:42.160> pump<00:04:43.160> still

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
pump still off pump still off pump still

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.080 
pump still off pump still off pump still
off<00:04:44.650> now<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.710> pump<00:04:45.979> just<00:04:46.070> kicked<00:04:46.460> on<00:04:46.669> so<00:04:47.000> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
off now the pump just kicked on so you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.120 
off now the pump just kicked on so you
get<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.389> little<00:04:47.660> bit<00:04:47.780> more<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.710> know<00:04:48.860> if<00:04:48.949> you're

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
get a little bit more you know if you're

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.070 
get a little bit more you know if you're
rinsing<00:04:49.849> out<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.150> cup<00:04:50.419> or<00:04:50.570> something<00:04:50.750> it

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
rinsing out a cup or something it

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.270 
rinsing out a cup or something it
probably<00:04:51.169> wouldn't<00:04:51.740> come<00:04:51.889> on<00:04:52.099> maybe<00:04:53.139> a<00:04:54.280> lot

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
probably wouldn't come on maybe a lot

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.330 
probably wouldn't come on maybe a lot
definitely<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.849> little<00:04:56.090> bit<00:04:56.210> less<00:04:56.960> vibration<00:04:57.680> I

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
definitely a little bit less vibration I

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.570 
definitely a little bit less vibration I
like<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.840> can<00:05:00.020> run<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:00.320> water<00:05:00.530> like<00:05:01.340> this

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
like the you can run the water like this

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.490 
like the you can run the water like this
and<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:02.300> course<00:05:02.360> it's<00:05:02.660> not<00:05:02.750> running<00:05:03.050> now<00:05:03.229> but

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
and of course it's not running now but

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.100 
and of course it's not running now but
when<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:03.979> does<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:05.000> not<00:05:05.120> going<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.479> hammer

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
when it does it's not going to hammer

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.779 
when it does it's not going to hammer
like<00:05:06.530> you<00:05:06.650> did<00:05:06.770> before<00:05:08.020> get<00:05:09.020> it<00:05:09.050> going<00:05:09.380> again

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.270 

okay<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.910> pump<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.240> now<00:05:14.419> on<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:14.990> can<00:05:15.620> physically

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
okay the pump is now on I can physically

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.000 
okay the pump is now on I can physically
say<00:05:16.550> there's<00:05:16.759> no<00:05:16.970> change<00:05:17.419> in<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.750> stream<00:05:18.199> it

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
say there's no change in the stream it

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.689 
say there's no change in the stream it
was<00:05:19.599> identical<00:05:20.599> to<00:05:20.780> way<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.080> was<00:05:21.409> with<00:05:22.370> the

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
was identical to way it was with the

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.129 
was identical to way it was with the
accumulator<00:05:23.560> excuse<00:05:24.560> me<00:05:25.270> with<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> pump<00:05:26.599> off<00:05:26.840> as

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
accumulator excuse me with a pump off as

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.760 
accumulator excuse me with a pump off as
with<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.070> pump<00:05:28.310> on<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.840> no<00:05:30.020> change<00:05:30.349> in<00:05:30.560> there

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
with the pump on so no change in there

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.080 
with the pump on so no change in there
so<00:05:31.699> overall<00:05:32.060> I<00:05:32.210> think<00:05:32.720> it's<00:05:33.080> a<00:05:33.139> good<00:05:33.289> product<00:05:33.590> I

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
so overall I think it's a good product I

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.450 
so overall I think it's a good product I
didn't<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.240> any<00:05:35.389> other<00:05:35.419> videos<00:05:35.630> out<00:05:36.460> showing

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
didn't see any other videos out showing

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.399 
didn't see any other videos out showing

the before and after show people

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.980 
the before and after show people
installing<00:05:40.159> them<00:05:40.340> what<00:05:40.880> they<00:05:41.030> were<00:05:41.090> but<00:05:41.720> not
