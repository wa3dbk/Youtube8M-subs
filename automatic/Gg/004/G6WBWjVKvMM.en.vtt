00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 well let's see the star function 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.029
 for me the origin of the concept note that 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.130
 is the pencil when it comes to painting and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.200
 draw that I assure you that it is much more 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.480
 beyond what other products offer 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.920
 of the competition they are trying to emulate 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 with a pencil and with a pointer 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.020
 you can 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.880
 as simple as painting on the screen here 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.990
 goes way beyond that amount why 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.910
 what are we going to see now is the application 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.560
 of samsung notes the application of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 snow and good what we are going to see is in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.590
 reality the quality that this has 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.119
 pointer what technology allows us 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 that we incorporate in our screens 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 is to detect up to 2048 levels of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.469
 pressure then imagine us to the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 time to draw for example a point 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.969
 important the first new role as you 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.070
 was in 256 is the second the exact 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.430
 third in stir thousand and peak and this its 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.469
 until 2000 2048 we doubled what we had 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.870
 before in pressure levels in cheese 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 allows as you see that difference of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.230
 traces you see that for example in this 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 part of here I have pressed less in 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 this part peasant more then because 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.760
 also what you are doing when the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.960
 people start using the pencil is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 I noticed many people that in the error of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.949
 paint and then to touch up it seems that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 it's very complicated it's as simple as 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.760
 zoom in on the screen in a double of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.190
 down 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.740
 and you can expand to a brutal level and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.380
 retouch the drawing very well and something 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.710
 important is that I can support myself and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 to write 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.090
 I can be saying that although good of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.409
 done when you set it up I think it's 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.180
 an option that tells you not to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.100
 you can not paint when you put on 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.119
 As you can see, you can support your hand and not 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.560
 paint do not use your fingers to do here 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.970
 you have all the different 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 functionalities we have found 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 incorporated in the two new pens 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 to write are states that you see here 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.740
 that allow us well then get 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.740
 different behaviors 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.630
 you see that when it 's like a form 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.729
 much more elegant then all this is 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.140
 can cut with a pdf jpg in a row 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.090
 where I would do now for example 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.219
 is to save this note with a note 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.920
 any and good within the 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.899
 synchronization options that I have of 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.520
 within my application of notes that do not 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.200
 let's adjust the account 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.420
 synchronization as you see here is in 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.599
 evernote we would enter inside here 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.030
 now do so that you see let's see 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.349
 when it has been synchronized the last time 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.690
 we force a synchronization so that 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.400
 now let's go to the application of 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 evernote we have it here 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.450
 of this one 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.810
 and well here you see all the notes that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.030
 as we were before and externally 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.620
 If we wanted to edit it, we would have to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.560
 go back to the nude in only hear and 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.540
 back is product is not automatic what 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.090
 only that when editing the other 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.040
 note in snow yes that will recognize that 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.900
 is this same note and it would crush on 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 the track of value the perfect ideal 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170
 ideal
