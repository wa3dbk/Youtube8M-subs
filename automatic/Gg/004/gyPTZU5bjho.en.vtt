00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 very good guys girls if animals 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 helpless and welcome to chapter 43 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.250
 of white pokemon and today is also a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.559
 event but it is quite is more special 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 why good for hibernating sea 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 we have managed to get 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 get to win the legendary dogs 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.109
 of an event that takes place a quarter 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.199
 agent in a pokémon heartgold and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.070
 soulsilver with which they unleash 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.070
 the hector event 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.770
 in the event that was held for health 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.320
 silver only one good one was distributed 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.610
 I got 23 to teach us what and says 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.200
 that we are going to catch lost fliers 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.490
 let's see their states and such to see how 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.930
 they have left me 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:48.380
 if I am he gets like that nor the magical ones 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.330
 this normal offensive is defensive like this 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.190
 have a bus in defense enough 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.560
 good and speed is practically what 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.860
 worse than it has with the attack so it 's 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.600
 very good the short cut trunk aerial 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.660
 extreme speed and square or 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.030
 directly bring a gift ribbon 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.160
 the next one is going to be rooted with a 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.570
 loaded tape also says the same thing that 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.300
 we take something I've lost with the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 I'll win a goal and put that special saying of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.460
 pokemon our cannon is that we the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.369
 velocities theme in mind gold ball and the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.880
 next and for me my favorite next to 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.430
 raikkonen until 3 I would say that in you 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.600
 suite with and raid 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.509
 we like more the third one is going to be 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.460
 also that look like this conjunction and 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.369
 bush in the afternoon another bug is we go back 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.660
 and in none of the same thing that I'm going to do 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.970
 with this good event we're going to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.200
 approach and bernard and I good only 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.659
 we will share one why 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 since in the official event only 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:57.270
 they gave one I have the three tests 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:02.230
 and we'll deal one tell you dogs event 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.950
 finish appear in it will appear in it 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.220
 in the pc since it is the exchange of your 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.100
 own pokémon heartgold is the one who made 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 the event did the and he got it 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.090
 about 3 and nothing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.129
 I'm going to go first with you have to 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.239
 leave two because we are going to unleash the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.700
 boat event so I already put this 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.659
 is in the events pokemon and I go with 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.659
 Your son I think 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.550
 today south says let's go to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.340
 to the forest 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.470
 well that lost 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.810
 the low of the lost such 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:51.670
 so I'm going over there in the city 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.860
 carries the simat sachs good 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.090
 I was here, no, no, it's the return of 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.090
 giant then it is here 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.640
 in the event 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.530
 I remember with the 33 students 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.800
 since I had gotten them through and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.140
 after a lot of work, nothing 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.470
 lots of mistakes this but we have already 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.470
 got 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.000
 good 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:31.410
 it is a great level 2022 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.410
 you still do not carry birds 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.120
 with brute force 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.120
 and cocks 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.200
 They really cool the dogs if my 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.030
 I personally like it very much 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.720
 especially upload one in colors that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.700
 I really like that color in 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.770
 teguise seems a lot and raipur like me 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.770
 also the clear thing to get them out 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.280
 this is what comes out with the name of 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.790
 Japanese why 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.360
 Japanese elements of Japanese look 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.420
 without equal is that this blue is better 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.990
 still and define them from normal but 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.830
 well let let's nonsense apart 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.560
 throw a max suddenly to not have 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.090
 problems and going to put from first to max 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.030
 sachs by itself that is your mouth will have to 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.480
 catch him and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.490
 appears with the shape of the water 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.490
 will appear with the electric I suppose 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.390
 let's take your vehicle 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.820
 and nothing by going directly for the fake 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.640
 stroke 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.950
 1 of life can not be cured does not have 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.840
 no movement to heal anything in 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.940
 that song if you already know that they are 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.940
 relatively easy the legendary 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.520
 shit 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.520
 good for awake 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.630
 the trouble I think it's not night are 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.630
 7:30 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.360
 let's try and I see that I do not 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.849
 night 3 perfect very easy good luck 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.919
 also against without sleep or anything 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.930
 good hours trapped this is the event 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.689
 official of the white we could not put 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.689
 the nickname we did in here 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:54.270
 where he lives there was something strange but 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.610
 nothing to react quickly to the 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.900
 pokemon that you wore have to be 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.530
 linked by some kind of link 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.530
 mysterious 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.670
 oh sure this is the park clear and now 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.100
 this is the part will start at the point 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.550
 black and white 2 in the milk since I 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.440
 that it was not the same to use their stands 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.060
 nonsense me at 25 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.060
 because lost to see 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:28.370
 a shit but this is not either 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.370
 the only thing that I do not like although it has 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.050
 So much is special because 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.240
 after all, only the base is something 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.710
 so physical so special the speed 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.110
 is moving I have the bus because you can 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.640
 get many clips 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.560
 but I do not know I do not just convince 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.590

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.340

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.850
 official event is like this is not because it is not 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.200
