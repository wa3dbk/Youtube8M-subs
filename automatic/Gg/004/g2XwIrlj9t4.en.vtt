00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.230
 so then 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.099
 let's take a nice one 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.099
 let's take a look 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.860
 the same level we read one 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.200
 once established that practically this 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.310
 it could also be maximum 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.439
 bring you four years 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.500
 of the arrow that was there red that we 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.849
 we have four that line 4 meters of 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.020
 450 million 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.840
 if we begin to cut the first one 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.879
 top and see what we choose the form 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.860
 vegetative we read we are a 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.230
 that is, choosing absolutely is not that 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.879
 we can cut the christ and this e 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.019
 let him remain at the tenth because 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.079
 we have customers 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.879
 the law form to say ah this this 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.190
 it is a little stronger then stronger 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.890
 this to choose mendalÃ  this 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.790
 they will be practically only branches e 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.070
 we have seen that they are a bit weak 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.100
 but this is all self- assured action 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.510
 the same does not mean that we will have to 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.310
 let this be that we could 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.380
 quietly remove that leave 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:18.159
 the dawn that is worth double if this item 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.009
 this top serves with us we don't 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.070
 the discourse of the dichotomy is another 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.860
 once two soprano va ben barnes there is 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.859
 this is here on the main top 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.409
 well then then the common top goes 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:37.590
 the final part is left below 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.149
 also sometimes spread a little towards the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.100
 face a little outward might 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.140
 be this too but we are too much 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.329
 otherwise this is again and is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.049
 a little weaker than this where better 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.049
 do so 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.860
 when always on the side 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.439
 in a bit drastic, however, this is the first one 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.379
 what arrived last in some way 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:25.260
 you could even slightly but it will go 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.170
 combo on stage with very well the real 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.939
 work and this is the top the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.299
 part that comes outward that is 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:38.609
 doing finishing that is not always true 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.379
 can later change the 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.409
 half of the third year we come up here 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.989
 this other decoder track to say where 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.190
 leave the house if the branch but too much 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.200
 towards the inland 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.060
 cut you have to try to bring it back 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.930
 of have a modest exterior where too much 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:01.580
 the outwards make the return towards 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.580
 which here is the top you choose 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.190
 always look at the path I told you the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.400
 path of being linear going 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.350
 too much this language in this is fine 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.660
 with Wednesday's ace that 's fine with this 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.770
 dramatic and just must go on though 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:24.330
 which if you want this surely not 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.730
 this is certainly not this either 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.820
 because it speaks to you right at the full stage 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.480
 first wanting this match under never 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:38.450
 This definitely no lo asks 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:46.020
 clean city block for the twins which one 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:48.420
 spain cut up could be 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.630
 this too the little bolaro among 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.959
 vertical between positives at 35 st pulls 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:00.780
 too much this is a million this one 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.670
 what better though we talk about this here 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.280
 so far we may fear that this will happen to me 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.410
 takes and the arrow and stands under this 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.239
 understood this the arrow should stand 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.670
 higher than this of four 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.670
 stop this way look 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.240
 on cooler tosses it should be paid 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.390
 from rice let's never be too fu 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.130
 this vision is fine here 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.400
 this problem we need to cut 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.900
 that's all, and this is doing here though 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.970
 from the thousand 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.350
 however if this is the analysis it is not enough to 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:42.040
 the hacksaw drift or were the hacksaw 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.870
 with lester followed not so secretly with 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.440
 the Tuscan season is not coming 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:53.310
 followed this bear this but with the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:56.050
 others I was also already summit 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.699
 nation 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.159
 all the amnesties wanted to lower you 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:06.069
 tibolone diamond you pass first game is 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:06.069
 equal however vistalli already controls 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.600
 here rushed because it was considered defining 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.390
 staff remains all good this was not 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.890
 day of retreat then this is never that 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:26.840
 that I ask myself is never quietly 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:26.840
 cut to reduce this freshly cut 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:40.020
 yes because everyone always who this is 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:46.560
 instead he wants to leave like this in June 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:49.070
 This is the manager's left is fine 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.810
 we always realize convinced to give to 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.530
 this 8 this mythical shadow too 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.740
 check this at the police station 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.350
 let's remember this in 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:07.530
 this titration winters this here 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:10.170
 not here but now I'm less but this 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.170
 wine but it does not seem so because we 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.980
 we do football if we do this 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.510
 we make the dog it will seem like parts 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.690
 horizontal squa and here where he went 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:28.070
 this evidence does not go away at all 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:28.070
 written my life this is mine here 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.070
 enough until the end of the month which sees ce 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.980
 we can do it 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:51.620
 the arrow here which was that one was 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:07:07.580
 this was what we said was a bit 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:07:09.950
 too high and after the double section 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.910
 brian double cemetery dress is gone 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.510
 the mission will then be question is this 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.510
 edition 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.979
 looking at her tongue 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.790
 when we opened this
