promo<00:00:38.070> series<00:00:38.460> isn't<00:00:39.030> reason<00:00:39.629> why<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.780> would

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
promo series isn't reason why I would

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.930

promo<00:00:44.489> cards<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.910> mean<00:00:45.030> think<00:00:45.180> about<00:00:45.210> our

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
promo cards I mean think about our

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930 
promo cards I mean think about our
series<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.320> we're<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.920> 40s<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.760> 50s

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
series I think we're in the 40s or 50s

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.590 
series I think we're in the 40s or 50s
maybe<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.960> hour<00:00:49.379> black-and-white<00:00:49.950> series<00:00:50.600> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
maybe an hour black-and-white series and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
maybe an hour black-and-white series and
probably<00:00:52.469> once<00:00:52.649> against<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> 60s<00:00:53.640> or<00:00:53.699> 70s

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
probably once against to the 60s or 70s

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
probably once against to the 60s or 70s
they'll<00:00:54.360> probably<00:00:54.570> cut<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> off<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> go<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
they'll probably cut it off and go to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
they'll probably cut it off and go to
something<00:00:55.829> else<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.129> probably<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.390> do

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
something else but probably about not do

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.590 
something else but probably about not do
for<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.109> next<00:00:58.260> block<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.920> sets<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.420> get

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for the next block of sets so we get

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
for the next block of sets so we get
less<00:01:00.899> than<00:01:01.140> half<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.359> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
less than half of what they get and this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
less than half of what they get and this
set<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.189> particular<00:01:05.430> card

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
whip there we go so pretty much just a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.119
