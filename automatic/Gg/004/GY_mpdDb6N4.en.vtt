00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:09.910
 20 world 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.469
 wh 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.469
 me 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.620
 Hmm 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.620
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 dj 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 Anyway 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560
 Nice good 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.070
 dj 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.460
 Had 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.460
 Yes 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 Yes, saying Mars 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.300
 Is this sense 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.020
 So remember I just below 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.400
 deji was 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 I do not want to be stupid 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.010
 hoping 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.470
 Hmm 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.470
 I think I'm easy to feel this 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.310
 Do this in Japan 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 There 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 3 d o in Deca design to sister 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.500
 Haiku that I made by handing it to Mr. Yamaguchi because I have the information of POI book 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.430
 It is a flow yes 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.290
 Gotten a cad data of the first to that design 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.770
 Well it c tired of in Celine 's soft-tightened new cinema ice 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.270
 Even though we're working to convert to that format 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:23.920
 Well that still has quite a lot of polygons 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:28.570
 It will be an expensive task, but this kind of details 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 If the shape of that part or something like that overlaps 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.910
 a 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.760
 Ms. Kozo 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.040
 Jerky and this time but I got to Toka or uses the z campus 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.700
 The animation is fine 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.930
 Daddy part 8 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.069
 Kedomo it had not bid here still part devil animation 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:56.700
 A smooth head to true 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.359
 Even when the aker who is made a slide, it moves so crisply, so even when adding animation 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.840
 Sope 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.420
 Contains the response that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.420
 It is easy to do various try &amp; error 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.050
 That you can work very comfortably 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.990
 I thought it was a stick 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:23.000
 In or around at the moment if the heat It is there of Toko performed by the that child with such a place 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:26.930
 After that, I will not come to my mind at once. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.340
 A highly significant load bottom but there is a video 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.330
 number 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:36.300
 Possible but we heard a while multi-be 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.960
 Because I wanted to express something like the amazing structure of the internal structure from now on 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.920
 of 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.890
 First, even if it sees a single one of the parts the customer data in the from the shell very well to that of design 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.340
 Good 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:56.430
 Because the quality is high, it is the time of that time when combining it to such a place 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:03.480
 I think that I will laugh and say that Mr. 2 season will also speak 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:10.710
 a What made the data of z campus in the last part of the upsurge into a bar 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:14.910
 Three or three cars are arranged in a tunnel, and such a face camera 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:20.010
 In fact until there also will do but Dano I was finger in rushing 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:26.460
 Moma I'd come it takes quite a load when the fighting game or three minutes Arabelle 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:29.240
 Normally that played on such state You can deliberately of the Well fine animation 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:35.009
 It is adjustment 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:39.340
 I was able to work comfortably even in the preview environment 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.460
 Oh, even if a child and a woman change Hangul 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.510
 I was able to work quite comfortably 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.550
 Yes I also real is keep saying, come the first time today 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:57.250
 Yes, it's a 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:59.200
 It 's really hard to use the creative environment at that flower snow campus 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.520
 It was 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.520
 Heh fact
