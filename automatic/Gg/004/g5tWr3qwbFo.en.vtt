00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello everyone how good they are 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.750
 some different video in reality or equal 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.910
 going up in v2 channel but then 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.950
 thinking about it well I've seen that everything 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.370
 I was going to show you fit more in this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 channel 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.090
 first tell you that I am working 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 a lot and very hard that you will soon have 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.800
 news that you will like and about 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.170
 everything is going to take a lot of advantage but 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.760
 for now I do not want to tell you more 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 to have to wait for you to tell 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.640
 all the details well I do not roll up 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.500
 more and I'm going for what I wanted to tell you 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.149
 we were about a month ago in the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 product awards of the year in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.850
 barcelona and at the end of the gala they gave us 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.180
 a little box smile box there we could 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.110
 choose from some winning products 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.730
 our box with a value of 50 euros 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.829
 It is a subscription box that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 You can register online from your 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.120

 list and you select the products 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.469
 what interests you most for a value 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.680
 Approximately 50 euros but you do not pay more 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.850
 of 15 euros with 99 I find interesting 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 why 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.280
 that pay less than the actual value can 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 discover unexpected products in my 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 If there are two products in my box that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.909
 Take me away from the gala of the product of the year 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.750
 I find very interesting the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.549
 first is that of pure is a drink 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.820
 fruit extract and also tea 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.009
 white and contains stevia is delicious 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.950
 and it's very natural and I love this 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.539
 kind of things so we have renewed the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.390
 another product is a natural sweetener 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.640
 of fruits that contains 25% less 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.560

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.009
 I want to renounce him so always 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.909
 I'm looking for alternatives and this is 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.310
 very rich and I am using it 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.319

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.289

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.909

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.490
 discovery of this year that has 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.790
 saved the life 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.970
 good are these sports clicks the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.610
 nimbus 16 yo lately I was 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.459
 complaining a lot about the pain of knees and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 I reconsidered very seriously change 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.819
 I was recommended by these sports 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.780
 looking for information online and for 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.550
 my problem I thought they were the right ones 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 it has an extra cushioning are very 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.730
 are tender to use in the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.010
 workouts every day and also avoid 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.890
 Achilles heel injuries and it's 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.450
 of neutral tread I'm happy I think 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.870
 that will come back will not cost me 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.060
 re -use other sports that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.489
 tell us with good about this style 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.790
 although they are running I use them to 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.030
 the gym and for everything even for 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.160
 daily with my james my boyfriend always me 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.310
 sports strategy especially 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.470
 when we shoot, it's very comfortable and very 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.239
 practical and to avoid my pain of 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.190
 knees do not just change from sports 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.019
 but I also started to take the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.210
 collagen that they recommended to me what 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.610
 take with magnesium 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.130
 much better that I take it in powder is 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.500
 Ideal joints the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.420
 ligaments the bones but not just for 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.160
 this but also for the skin in 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.080
 our hair you have to be very 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360
 constant I have been more than six months 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.420
 but I'm much better I do not know if it's the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.910
 Sports do not know if the collagen and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.180
 the magnesium but I really have noticed 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.490
 besides the magnesium fights or diminishes 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.280
 tiredness and fatigue now I have 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.860
 a few months using xperia luro niko 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.930
 of fortÃ© pharma because it not only has 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.820
 collagen but also has acid 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.770
 hyaluronic what I also recommend 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.740
 I love making milkshakes 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.080
 detox I do them every morning with 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.390
 vegetable fruit and mixed them with water or 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.430
 with vegetable milk before I made them with 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.410
 a blender that I had at home but 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.140
 since I have a mini blender and 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.060
 I do directly in the container 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.220
 I still use it more and it is very very 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.870
 I recommend it to you because it is very 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.470
 healthy because you eat fruit and vegetables 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.210
