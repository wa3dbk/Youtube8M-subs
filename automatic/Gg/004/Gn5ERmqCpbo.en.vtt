00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.460
 Hi, I'm Carmen from driving schools 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.350
 first we are in badalona and we are going to 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.259
 talk about the subject of lights concepts 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.410
 basic lights for the time of 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.360
 circular that we do them correctly 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.119
 first know that the lights do not just 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.000
 they serve to see serve to see and to 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.340
 be seen to be seen in addition to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.149
 to signal maneuvers as they are 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.180
 the intermittent is worth then let's 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.870
 see the basic lights that on the one hand 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.210
 there are the position and position 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.850
 are these that when people have the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.900
 short lights or the long sunsets we see 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:52.240
 some red lights behind these are those of 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:56.020
 position is worth behind are red ahead 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.329
 they are white, they are worth what they do not usually 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.000
 note because as we carry the short or 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.970
 the long ones do not look much but 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.560
 they are always on the sides 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.470
 it is then amber lights 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.880
 of position are these the lights of 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.970
 position 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.330
 they are left in some cases lit 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.450
 turned on when parking stop 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.390
 or be detained but this already 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.570
 go in another section yes here we will see 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.510
 when we put the position lights 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.690
 circulating then there are the lights of 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.080
 crossing that are the usual short ones what 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.000
 which we call crossing or short range and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.220
 then there are the road lights or they are 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.670
 or long or long-range which is what 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.580
 same if the difference that the long 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.160
 they illuminate along as the name says 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.920
 along then they can dazzle to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.460
 those that come from front and those of cross 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 shines more to the wide ones then 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.780
 they are for lighting without dazzling 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.539
 still know that if you cut them 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.870
 they are more regulated its orientation is worth 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.700
 It's not the right one because we have a lot 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.069
 charge or because they are simply wrong 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.490
 could dazzle those who come from 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.530
 against each other so if someone we 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.560
 question the dipped headlights can 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.060
 dazzle it yes yes if they are badly ruled 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.500
 ok, we're still 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.500
 there is a difference 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:43.840
 between a sufficiently illuminated path 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:48.060
 a sufficiently illuminated path and a 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 insufficiently illuminated way 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.230
 sufficiently illuminated 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.690
 insufficiently illuminated if one way 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.350
 is sufficiently illuminated is that it is 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.040
 at night but there are streetlights and you see if a 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.510
 via is insufficiently illuminated is 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.650
 night and also it does not look absolutely 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.110
 nothing is considered that a way is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.460
 insufficiently illuminated when not 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.660
 we can read a license plate well 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.960
 10 meters away 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:30.560
 or a vehicle painted dark as 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.840
 black or navy blue 50 meters 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.780
 confuse but the license plate 50 meters 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.400
 we will never see it even if it's day 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.709
 then one way is insufficiently 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.860
 illuminated when we do not see when not 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.160
 we see a license plate of 10 meters or 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.310
 a vehicle painted from dark to 50 yes 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.950
 then what lights do we put in each type 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.730
 from villa to start we're going to 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.550
 differentiate between urban roads that are 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.830
 those that are inside the town and by 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.190
 so are urban roads those of 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.980
 in town and cruises if 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.730
 we remember that it is a piece of 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.000
 road that passes inside the town 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.630
 Urban streets are the streets of the town and 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.650
 cruises and on the other hand there are the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.140
 long- distance interurban roads are 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.650
 those that are outside the town because the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.249
 highways freeways highways for 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.979
 automobiles and conventional without 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:40.489
 then the urban roads in town 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.659
 and crossing is seen or is not seen ie 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:46.939
 whether the path is sufficient or 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:50.449
 insufficiently illuminated always 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:54.039
 we have to put position 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.039
 and crossing 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.280
 position and cross the cross roads that are 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.050
 the short-range or if 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.610
 whenever we put these have to go 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.090
 accompanied by position yes that and in 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.090
 interurban roads 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.230
 depending if the way is 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.160
 sufficiently illuminated we can put 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:26.150
 or crossing or road let's say at least 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.840
 crossing though you can also put the 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.210
 of road 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.169
 and if life is insufficient 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.169
 illuminated 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.510
 if we go up to 40 kilometers per hour 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.510
 also necessarily crossing though 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.290
 we can put the road and if 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.780
 we go more than 40 kilometers per hour 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.680
 of road 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.100
 as long as it does not dazzle girl no one is worth 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.250
 know that in these cases obviously 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.340
 also accompanied by position when 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:09.360
 we are circulating or we do not put lights or 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:12.120
 but at least two if in urban always 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.040
 position and crossing position are the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.630
 prohibited even if it's day called in 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.670
 interurban time if you see at least 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.940
 produce position and crossing if we want 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.370
 put the long one as well 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:30.129
 insufficiently illuminated to more than 40 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.339
 of road 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:36.069
 Well I hope you liked it and I 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:37.809
