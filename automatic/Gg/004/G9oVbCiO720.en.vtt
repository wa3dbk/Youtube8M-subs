00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 a game about great ambitions and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:14.370
 little self-control today in time to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:16.529
 fiasco hello dice very good and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 welcome again in dice time 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 today we are going to treat fiasco a game that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.570
 as you can see, it's quite finite that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 it's a little special role playing game more 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.779
 that nothing because it's not the typical game of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.730
 role in which you have a master that you 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.270
 is raising the situation in which 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.750
 you're watching this is a narrative game 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.520
 cooperative that is a role play 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.719
 It has distinct and different sheet 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.539
 character you do not have a module created by 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.390
 only one person but it is a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.610
 cooperative effort on the part of everything 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.329
 the world around the world that participates in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 create a history of losers is a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.850
 stop is the typical story in plan 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 film of the brothers coen which a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.589
 group of losers meet because 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.360
 they look for something or have one or have 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.350
 conflicting ambitions 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.710
 and everything ends up frighteningly bad 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.940
 how fiasco works 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 relatively simple to explain for 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.700
 sometimes a bit complicated because it has 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 few rules but the ones you have there you have to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 catch the more or less at the beginning 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.760
 mainly what happens is that at 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.140
 beginning of the game meets a 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.360
 series of dice to make a series of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.580
 runs and finished more or less 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.490
 roles that each 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.740
 one but they are not guidelines to follow 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.830
 but they are simply 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.980
 guidelines as if they were suggestions 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.170
 so the players are assigned 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.690
 the roles that the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.600
 relationships that they have with each other and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.670
 the roles they are going to play and what 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 who are trying to find then 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.140
 As each game goes by 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.360
 player are having a turn in which 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 can either raise or solve 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.150
 raise means that it raises a 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.250
 situation that we are living your 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.590
 character and the rest of the players 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.930
 decide if you succeed in what you want 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 get in that scene or you do not have it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.620
 then a white die is assigned if 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.450
 has succeeded a black die if he has 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.989
 failed 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.330
 in case you see a die at 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.980
 beginning of the game the player 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.349
 decide who is given to that die not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.890
 it only remains then as it goes 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.510
 the shifts are being created 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.890
 relationships between the rest of the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.989
 players and scenes are created 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.230
 gradually when you have assigned the 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.650
 half of the dice 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.940
 what happens is that the game happens to the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.349
 second phase that will be a little more 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.150
 complicated that is the turn when the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.420
 things start to twist then you have to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.250
 go towards resolutions 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.440
 certainly said what to raise but what 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.630
 said not to solve and solve is what 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.770
 same as asking what the rest of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.170
 the players are the ones who raise the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.290
 situation and the player is the one who decides 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 If you succeed or do not succeed in the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.250
 case of the second act is when it 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.920
 they split half of the dice happens 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.650
 on the contrary that is not the case 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.870
 otherwise, what really happens is that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.420
 the dice that you get for having 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.269
 success fail you keep it then 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.620
 end of the game depending on the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.160
 data that you have had 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.050
 whites or blacks is pulled and it ends 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.390
 more or less the result and then it 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.870
 interprets that the results can be 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.959
 or that you have lived rich or rich 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.970
 rest of your life has survived more or 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.600
 less unharmed or have you had a final 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.270
 frightening 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 the game 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.290
 it's pretty fast inside that 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.480
 you can play a session of a pair of 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.730
 hours or so and as a disadvantage you 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.100
 could blame that it depends a lot on 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.960
 the open ones that are the players and what 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.760
 imaginative is that it is but the truth is 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.470
 which is a game that is relatively 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.720
 fun to which more or less people 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.200
 more or less are going on it's a 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.880
 game that good is relatively cheap 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.810
 to get is a novelty more or less 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.510
 relative that what came out a year ago 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.280
 more or less and good 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.750
 If you want we spent an afternoon forget 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.250
 fiasco 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.660
 it is a good recommendation many 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.660
 thanks for following me and until next time
