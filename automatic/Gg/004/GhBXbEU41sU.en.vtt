00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.270
 hello everyone welcome back to me 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.240
 channel and today I bring you a tutorial of 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.600
 how to fix a broken lipstick as you see 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.340
 this is new 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.230
 I bought it in an order I made to 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.590
 make up since that I have to 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.650
 teach and at fairs painting the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.600
 lips snapped 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.600
 Then the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:36.940
 put it in the freezer so that 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.680
 hard but what we are going to do is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.310
 put it separately let's put a 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.560
 little piece of paper and this we are going to leave out 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.910
 so let's put in the freezer 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.910
 for 10 minutes separately and now 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.370
 we have to leave it like that in the freezer 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.810
 for 10 minutes worth and now we 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 taught once past 10 minutes 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.570
 As you can see, it is already frozen and what 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 let's do with a lighter 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.509
 we will warm largar 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.509
 the part here from below 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.310
 and it's a bit 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.640
 and we are going to paste it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.210
 and let's put it as straight as possible 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.980
 and we check that you can get inside 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.770
 perfect 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.630
 and now what we will do to you 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.300
 this union solidifies and does not come back 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.009
 from we are going to put it in the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.170
 freezer 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.170
 during oneself sees and is bent 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.579
 let's put it in the freezer a couple 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:20.840
 of hours with two hours that is enough 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:24.819
 and we already take it out and we'll save it 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.819
 where we had it and it is already the 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.819
 lip 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 again again like me 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.170
 and I 'm going to try to put it as 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.170
 cool possible 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.519
 as straight as possible so that when 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.489
 take them out of the freezer look like 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.620
 is new I keep them and with this other 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.810
 time in the freezer for two or three 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 horitas wait until morning and then not 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.349
 you will have new ones and when you do the hall 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.710
 to make up the new order now 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.050

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.390
