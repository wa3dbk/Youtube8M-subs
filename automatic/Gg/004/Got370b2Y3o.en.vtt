she's pretty cool about it she was uh

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.509 
she's pretty cool about it she was uh
she<00:03:10.989> slipped<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.620> my<00:03:11.769> side<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.190> did<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.400> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
she slipped on my side and did all that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.910 
she slipped on my side and did all that
stuff<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.209> whenever<00:03:13.450> she<00:03:13.989> heard<00:03:14.260> like<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> twig

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.979 
stuff but whenever she heard like a twig
break<00:03:15.370> she<00:03:15.940> would<00:03:16.090> instantly<00:03:16.510> start<00:03:16.810> barking
