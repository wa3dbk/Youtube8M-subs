for<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.340> way<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.610> does<00:02:13.790> help<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.930> softer

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
for this way it does help so softer

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.820 
for this way it does help so softer
pressure<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.370> put<00:02:16.400> on<00:02:17.470> smaller<00:02:18.470> brush

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
pressure you put on smaller brush

becomes<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.120> we're<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.230> color<00:02:21.709> in

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430
