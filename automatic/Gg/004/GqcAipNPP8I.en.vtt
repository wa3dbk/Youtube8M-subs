00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
video before about in terrible quality

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.740 
video before about in terrible quality
so<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.890> thought<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.550> would<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:08.940> good<00:00:09.179> making<00:00:09.450> it

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
so I thought it would be good making it

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.280 
so I thought it would be good making it
again<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:12.120> video<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.540> will<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.900> showing

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
again so in this video I will be showing

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.650 
again so in this video I will be showing
how<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.559> make<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.980> rocket<00:00:14.429> ship<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.820> flies<00:00:15.059> up

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
how to make a rocket ship that flies up

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.380 
how to make a rocket ship that flies up
in<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.199> straight<00:00:16.470> line<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.940> started

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in a straight line so let's get started

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
in a straight line so let's get started
you<00:00:18.449> will<00:00:18.660> need<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.140> cup<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.580> sticky

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you will need a cup I think one sticky

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.089 
you will need a cup I think one sticky
piston<00:00:21.680> two<00:00:22.970> regular<00:00:23.970> piston<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.720> read<00:00:25.680> snow

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
piston two regular piston I read snow

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
piston two regular piston I read snow
like<00:00:26.580> three<00:00:26.849> redstone<00:00:27.090> blocks<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.230> couple

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
like three redstone blocks and a couple

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.420 
like three redstone blocks and a couple
of<00:00:28.590> slime<00:00:28.830> blocks<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.900> you<00:00:30.900> start<00:00:31.230> by<00:00:31.740> placing

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
of slime blocks so you start by placing

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.420 
of slime blocks so you start by placing
down<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> piston<00:00:33.329> that's<00:00:33.540> facing<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.559> place

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
down a piston that's facing up you place

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.510 
down a piston that's facing up you place
our<00:00:35.670> three<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.809> slime<00:00:37.140> blocks<00:00:37.530> another

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
our three more slime blocks another

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.540 
our three more slime blocks another
piston<00:00:40.040> one<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> redstone<00:00:43.079> block

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
piston one to you and a redstone block

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.319 
piston one to you and a redstone block
you<00:00:44.550> break<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.059> block<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.379> block

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
you break that block and this block

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
you break that block and this block
place<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.600> block<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.340> place<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> redstone

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
place that block down place a redstone

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
place that block down place a redstone
block<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
block over there and there and this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.970 
block over there and there and this
between<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.559> Machine

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
between them so now you have the Machine

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
between them so now you have the Machine
done<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.079> actually

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
done but if you want you can actually

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.470 
done but if you want you can actually
add<00:00:58.739> something<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> have

add something up here so that you have
like<00:01:03.480> room<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.439> stay<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.400> walk<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.150> stand<00:01:06.659> on

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
like room to stay on walk on stand on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.090 
like room to stay on walk on stand on
whatever<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.070> let<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.590> put<00:01:10.590> an<00:01:10.799> iron

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
whatever so let me just put an iron

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
whatever so let me just put an iron
block<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.729> does<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.090> need<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.659> iron<00:01:13.020> but

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
block it does not need to be iron but

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.730 
block it does not need to be iron but
iron<00:01:13.439> looks<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.760> our<00:01:14.880> locket<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:16.530> no
