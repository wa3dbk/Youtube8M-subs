00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 fuck it's been a year now how fast 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
 the time passes well we all want that 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.870
 this ends quickly so like all my 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.870
 specials I hope you like it 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.760
 To celebrate this date we will make a top 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.040
 of better Christmas movies or more 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.110
 well of the Christmas movies that more 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.110
 I liked it very well, let's start 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.540
 I know that this movie already has them fed up 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.550
 I know that sequel has been made after sequel 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.700
 I know that the child can not be more 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.470
 annoying but you know something I like if 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.810
 this is how this movie caught my attention 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.490
 from the first moment I saw her and 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.590
 I loved how it shows those 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.020
 coincidences of life that although it is 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.150
 very rare that they happen are not impossible and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.480
 that's why this movie gets a place in 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.480
 the top 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 this movie is not one of my favorites 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.670
 but it's still very good not only does it count 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.829
 with a good animation but the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 history is also very good of course not 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.909
 escapes from certain errors both in the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.560
 history as in the way of telling oneself 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.899
 one of the things that made me 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.850
 quickly discard it quickly from 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.860
 my favorite movie list was what 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.929
 same in times the story goes more 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.420
 slow that a turtle on a snail 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.250
 but in others it accelerates too much 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 that you have to see it practically two 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.659
 times the scene to understand it still 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.110
 the story is very beautiful and quickly 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 it gets you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.120
 and they know even though many about 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.340
 they value this movie someone what 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.650
 I like very much not only because of the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.599
 history not only because of the effects but 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.670
 for the action that is used in this 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.609
 movie or rather in these sagas of 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.439
 movie although it does not show you 100% what 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.359
 what is the Christmas spirit if you 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.310
 shows one or another message of how the 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.909
 way of thinking of people towards the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.909
 Christmas changes 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.830
 Thank you 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.110
 it's nothing 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.410
 post 3 this is a classic in the cinema 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.970
 Christmas the grinch with the classic 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.950
 history of the who and the who who 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.140
 I hated Christmas so good that they have 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 made thousands and thousands of versions without 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.920
 mention it good of the performances I 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.920
 I did not recommend it 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.599
 alive 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.230
 all right 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.970
 cheer up and remember 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:48.790
 some years he showed us in position two 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.040
 of these is not considered a movie 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.140
 Christmas at a hundred but still speaks a 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.420
 little of Christmas and they fuck is myth 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.330
 that I've always loved the movie without 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.730
 know why the music will be the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.220
 animation will be the character of jacques 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.850
 in itself I do not know but I recommend it to 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.850
 silence 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.680
 in the first place it does not matter how many 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.960
 times they pass it or see it this movie does not 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.910
 bores me I love the theme of this 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.010
 movie try to escape the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.110
 Christmas' the truth although it is predictable 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.820
 Sometimes it's very funny without 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.130
 mention all the Christmas messages 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.660
 that leaves you in truth this is my 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.660
 favorite Christmas movie 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.560
 suffered to be 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.500
 you know I wish I could put more 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.900
 content to this video but they already know 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.970
 I have two other planned projects that 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.920
 I take up a lot of my time so 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.470
 So far we leave it I hope that you 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.470
 I liked it says goodbye to you manga comics
