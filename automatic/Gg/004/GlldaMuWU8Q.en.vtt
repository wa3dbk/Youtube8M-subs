damages say you won't be doing any sort
of<00:01:18.000> long-range<00:01:18.570> kills<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.500> gun

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of long-range kills with this gun

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.200

whatsoever<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.540> can't<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.080> does<00:01:22.500> nothing<00:01:23.210> now

whatsoever you can't it does nothing now

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
whatsoever you can't it does nothing now
then<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> comparisons<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.770> deagle<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
then the comparisons the deagle is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.399 
then the comparisons the deagle is
actually<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> fastest<00:01:27.240> firing<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.080> three

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
actually the fastest firing of all three

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
actually the fastest firing of all three
the<00:01:28.860> matter<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> second<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> combat

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the matter but is second and the combat

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
the matter but is second and the combat
is<00:01:30.780> third<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.259> I'll<00:01:31.560> replay<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.100> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is third and I'll replay it again in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
is third and I'll replay it again in
slow<00:01:32.400> motion<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
slow motion so that you can see the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.690 
slow motion so that you can see the
difference

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.680 

the<00:01:38.700> matter<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.180> actually

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
the matter that actually

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.110 
the matter that actually
the<00:01:39.900> slowest<00:01:40.380> reloadable<00:01:40.920> 3<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.580> Columba<00:01:41.970> has

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
the slowest reloadable 3 the Columba has

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.360 
the slowest reloadable 3 the Columba has
the<00:01:42.300> fastest<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.200> deagle<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.950> between

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
the fastest and the deagle is in between

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.370 
the fastest and the deagle is in between
the<00:01:44.520> two<00:01:44.670> I've<00:01:44.850> replayed<00:01:45.720> again<00:01:46.050> in<00:01:46.170> slow

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the two I've replayed again in slow

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.110 
the two I've replayed again in slow
motion<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:46.980> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
motion so that you can actually see the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.790 
motion so that you can actually see the
difference<00:01:48.450> between<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.870> reloads

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.560 

the<00:01:56.370> matter<00:01:56.580> vers<00:01:56.850> actually<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> middle

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the matter vers actually in the middle

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
the matter vers actually in the middle
for<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.960> reload<00:01:58.410> times<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:59.370> were<00:01:59.430> Condor<00:02:00.180> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
for the reload times they were Condor is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
for the reload times they were Condor is
obviously<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> fastest<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.800> know<00:02:02.010> most<00:02:02.160> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
obviously the fastest I'm I know most of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.860 
obviously the fastest I'm I know most of
you<00:02:02.370> already<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.730> this<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.420> deagle<00:02:03.780> is

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
you already know this but the deagle is

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.360 
you already know this but the deagle is
actually<00:02:04.200> slower<00:02:04.500> than<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.800> matter<00:02:05.010> but<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
actually slower than the matter but I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.460 
actually slower than the matter but I
replay<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.120> again<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.450> slow<00:02:06.630> motion<00:02:06.810> once

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
replay it again in slow motion once

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.020 
replay it again in slow motion once
again<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:07.980> that<00:02:08.010> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> difference

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
again so that you can see the difference

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.590 
again so that you can see the difference
and<00:02:10.220> finally<00:02:11.220> my<00:02:11.370> own<00:02:11.490> opinion<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.180> honestly

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
and finally my own opinion now honestly

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.110 
and finally my own opinion now honestly
this<00:02:13.020> gun<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.160> surprised<00:02:14.550> me<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> didn't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
this gun kind of surprised me I didn't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120 
this gun kind of surprised me I didn't
really<00:02:15.330> expect<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.110> particularly<00:02:16.620> like

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
really expect it to be particularly like

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.850 
really expect it to be particularly like
great<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.030> any<00:02:18.180> way<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:19.680> actually

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
great in any way but it's actually

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.670 
great in any way but it's actually
pretty<00:02:20.190> fun<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.730> use<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.330> power<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.170> really

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
pretty fun to use the power is really

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.940 
pretty fun to use the power is really
good<00:02:22.920> there's<00:02:23.660> pretty<00:02:24.660> much<00:02:24.780> no<00:02:25.290> recoil

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
good there's pretty much no recoil

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.640 
good there's pretty much no recoil
whatsoever<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.360> mo<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> same<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
whatsoever the mo is the same as the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.160 
whatsoever the mo is the same as the
Kondos<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.190> mean<00:02:29.430> you're<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.270> losing

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
Kondos I mean you're not really losing

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
Kondos I mean you're not really losing
anything<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.800> stick<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> condor<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.820> mean

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
anything if you stick to a condor I mean

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.170 
anything if you stick to a condor I mean
it<00:02:33.060> sure<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.600> less<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> deagle<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.770> i

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
it sure is one less in the deagle but i

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
it sure is one less in the deagle but i
think<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.330> sound<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.260> design<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
think the sound and the design of the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.190 
think the sound and the design of the
gun<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.550> really<00:02:39.150> really<00:02:39.390> good<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.780> sounds

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
gun are really really good it sounds

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.240 
gun are really really good it sounds
amazing<00:02:41.100> when<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.670> shoot<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:43.650> just

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
amazing when you shoot it it's just

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.040 
amazing when you shoot it it's just
really<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.390> pick<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.660> up<00:02:45.750> it's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
really you just have to pick it up it's

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.780 
really you just have to pick it up it's
quite<00:02:46.560> quiet<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.220> hear<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:47.550> third

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
quite quiet if you hear it in third

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.270 
quite quiet if you hear it in third
person<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> shoot<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.770> yourself<00:02:50.100> is

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
person but when you shoot it yourself is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
person but when you shoot it yourself is
really<00:02:50.730> good<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.120> bet<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.260> fact<00:02:52.380> that

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
really good I bet I like the fact that

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
really good I bet I like the fact that
it's<00:02:52.620> GP<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> nice<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:53.970> GP<00:02:54.480> guns

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it's GP it's nice to see more GP guns

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.930 
it's GP it's nice to see more GP guns
sure<00:02:55.380> it's<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.710> rifle<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.370> at<00:02:56.460> least<00:02:56.550> it's<00:02:56.820> a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
sure it's on a rifle but at least it's a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.510 
sure it's on a rifle but at least it's a
pistol<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.480> something<00:02:57.930> that's<00:02:58.110> completely

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
pistol so something that's completely

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.270 
pistol so something that's completely
different<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.670> what<00:02:59.760> we've<00:02:59.940> seen<00:03:00.060> before<00:03:00.239> as

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
different to what we've seen before as

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.120 
different to what we've seen before as
in<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> reskin<00:03:03.570> say<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.760> think<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
in not a reskin say I think that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.070 
in not a reskin say I think that
although<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.880> high<00:03:12.480> power<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
although it's like really high power I

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.310 
although it's like really high power I
don't<00:03:13.470> think<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:14.040> as<00:03:14.250> good<00:03:14.550> as<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> deagle

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
don't think it's as good as a deagle

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.570 
don't think it's as good as a deagle
it's<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.500> great<00:03:16.709> contender<00:03:17.190> against<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
it's a great contender against the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.310 
it's a great contender against the
anacondrai<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.570> be<00:03:18.660> honest<00:03:18.870> I'd<00:03:19.020> say<00:03:19.170> it's

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
anacondrai to be honest I'd say it's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.530 
anacondrai to be honest I'd say it's
better<00:03:19.500> than<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.800> Anaconda<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:21.120> deagle

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
better than the Anaconda but the deagle

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.750 
better than the Anaconda but the deagle
has<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.080> extra<00:03:22.380> bullet<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.950> has<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.550> more

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
has the extra bullet it has the more

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.590 
has the extra bullet it has the more
kind<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:25.340> reliable<00:03:26.340> power<00:03:26.580> over<00:03:27.030> range<00:03:27.270> this

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
kind of reliable power over range this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.130 
kind of reliable power over range this
has<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> very<00:03:28.110> quite<00:03:28.709> quick<00:03:29.310> drop<00:03:29.820> off<00:03:30.060> for<00:03:30.989> its

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
has a very quite quick drop off for its

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.540 
has a very quite quick drop off for its
damage<00:03:31.470> you're<00:03:31.739> not<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.160> get<00:03:32.280> any<00:03:32.459> sort

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
damage you're not going to get any sort

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.620 
damage you're not going to get any sort
of<00:03:32.959> great<00:03:34.160> kills<00:03:35.160> over<00:03:35.430> long<00:03:35.670> ranges<00:03:36.180> sure

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
of great kills over long ranges sure

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.210 
of great kills over long ranges sure
their<00:03:36.870> pistols<00:03:37.200> not<00:03:37.410> meant<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.739> be<00:03:37.770> but<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.980> mean

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
their pistols not meant to be but I mean

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.110 
their pistols not meant to be but I mean
the<00:03:38.880> deagle<00:03:39.300> has<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.959> extra<00:03:40.670> option<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.940> it

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
the deagle has that extra option to it

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.960 
the deagle has that extra option to it
so<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.360> you're<00:03:42.540> not<00:03:42.600> having<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.640> just<00:03:44.640> say

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
so that you're not having to just say

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.580 
so that you're not having to just say
straight<00:03:45.360> up<00:03:45.480> reload<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.140> can<00:03:46.260> whip<00:03:46.410> out<00:03:46.560> your

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
straight up reload you can whip out your

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.979 
straight up reload you can whip out your
pistol<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.160> not<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.850> faff<00:03:48.480> around<00:03:48.630> for<00:03:48.959> a

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
pistol and not have to faff around for a

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.580 
pistol and not have to faff around for a
while<00:03:49.140> but<00:03:49.760> it's<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:51.090> really<00:03:51.900> honestly<00:03:52.470> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
while but it's a really honestly a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650 
while but it's a really honestly a
really<00:03:53.040> good<00:03:53.220> pistol<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.880> would<00:03:54.300> recommend

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
really good pistol I would recommend

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.420 
really good pistol I would recommend
getting<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.170> if<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.410> can<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.920> would<00:03:56.160> honestly

getting it if you can I would honestly

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.370 
getting it if you can I would honestly
recommend<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:57.180> over<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.630> Anaconda<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
recommend it over the Anaconda the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.620 
recommend it over the Anaconda the
Anaconda<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.040> great<00:03:59.370> sure<00:03:59.580> it's<00:03:59.730> faster<00:04:00.390> but<00:04:00.600> I

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
Anaconda is great sure it's faster but I

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.940 
Anaconda is great sure it's faster but I
mean<00:04:01.730> I'd<00:04:02.730> say<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:04.020> more<00:04:04.530> fun<00:04:04.740> to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
mean I'd say that this is more fun to

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.280

use<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.670> has

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
use it has

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.420

better<00:04:07.620> sound<00:04:08.579> better<00:04:08.939> skin<00:04:09.659> better<00:04:09.959> it's

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
better sound better skin better it's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.539 
better sound better skin better it's
it's<00:04:12.019> honestly<00:04:13.019> up<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.379> i<00:04:13.409> mean<00:04:13.680> i<00:04:13.890> would

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
it's honestly up to you i mean i would

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.300 
it's honestly up to you i mean i would
go<00:04:14.819> for<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.530> matter<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:16.739> if<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:16.949> can<00:04:17.160> if

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
go for the matter but if you can if

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.039 
go for the matter but if you can if
you've<00:04:17.430> got<00:04:17.639> GP<00:04:18.000> despair<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.630> don't<00:04:18.840> have

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
you've got GP despair if you don't have

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.860 
you've got GP despair if you don't have
a<00:04:19.079> condor<00:04:19.500> go<00:04:19.709> for<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.190> first<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.419> Condors

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
a condor go for this first the Condors

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.290 
a condor go for this first the Condors
fine<00:04:22.199> but<00:04:22.770> i<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.430> think<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.699> is<00:04:23.759> generally

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
fine but i just think this is generally

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.990 
fine but i just think this is generally
a<00:04:24.330> better<00:04:24.720> pistol<00:04:25.289> than<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.530> condor<00:04:26.000> anyway

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
a better pistol than the condor anyway

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.610 
a better pistol than the condor anyway
