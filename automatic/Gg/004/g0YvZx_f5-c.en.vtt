00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello everyone, I saw again today 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.660
 comment thanks for writing to me 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.609
 put huskies and the man wrote by the way 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 Now let's see I see who it is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 wrote so but it will not be easy 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.660
 do me now so fast I'm something 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.510
 see first video including later 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.880
 I'm starting to think so as not to find something 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.329
 also find the channel first channel baht 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:46.410
 food now find the battlefield channel 1 a 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:48.719
 that's the way i just don't remember which video 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.719
 written on my about sneakers just 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.379
 last so now avoda second 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 man with a nickname over overlord 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.869
 overlord wrote comparability and lipton but 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.180
 and naturally since I am a servant of the people 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.080
 as well as our these officials are all there 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 the president and all the servants are shorter here and we 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 free people here but i'm not really 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.830
 free i am your servant i have now decided 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.310
 do a review on olimp then apply i took 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.990
 lemon taste lemon lemon lipton bone what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.759
 some she had a strange design look 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.009
 this one is like i thought everything 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.229
 something sort of sticking 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.810
 that is, there is some red here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.220
 so incomprehensible blackout hell knows 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.979
 here is nastya which means green tea citrus 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.119
 here I am by the way here is not the bar this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.420
 tea lipton tea is not written get it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.820
 some interest and black tea 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.130
 probably nothing I took black was over 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 green I still wanted to take green 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.200
 more like this is not really for me 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.060
 like that and the place but i just took 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.649
 so because they are both with lemon well 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's test what's the difference 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.899
 so let's see how much it costs 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:21.080
 mean now second so lipton tea 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 lipton costs 54 rubles desperate sti 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.750
 worth 51 rubles 99 kopecks in total 3 rubles 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.260
 the difference and the whole 450 199 so 3 rubles 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.090
 the difference means it costs less but 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.010
 take away this volume chick less immediately this 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.040
 I saw that is, volume 05 you see 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.720
 written volume 05 one hundred percent 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.420
 natural freshness by the way yes here 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.030
 composition read means purified water 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.040
 sugar lemon orange juice 0 2 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.280
 percent citric acidity regulator 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.650
 taro acid sodium citrate extract 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.050
 green tea 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.110
 natural antioxidant flavors 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.570
 ascorbic acid is possible 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.330
 natural sediment formation but in 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.160
 In principle, nothing like this, she only citrate 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.220
 sodium that's that's what I do not mean 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.330
 such a bad no look lipton 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.180
 but we have lipton 06 see 0 6 liters 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.769
 that is, we have on basically on the fifth 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.440
 a part is more and a fifth of 50 rubles 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.590
 that's how much it is just 10 rubles 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.610
 if you add 10 rubles 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.400
 klepton it will cost 64 or rather 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.310
 the opposite is what you need to take 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.130
 add to the place 10 rubles and it turns out 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.600
 it will cost 61 rubles that is the place 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.120
 It will be more expensive to 6 rubles here even at 7 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.070
 that is, it turns out to end up carrying everything 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.549
 Equally expensive even though it costs less for 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.890
 she's just less I donâ€™t know right 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.290
 whether there was reading on the chest correctly so 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.480
 We look at the composition of the water sugar regulator 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.480
 acidity citric acid citrate 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.970
 sodium 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.400
 trizaschenny that is what rice there 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.830
 April just weird here 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.860
 substituted trisubstituted don't know 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.320
 look and see the composition so extract 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.139
 black tea so here we have the extract 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.090
 black tea Liu Chi here such 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.620
 yes green tea extract that is not 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.509
 green tea just this extract is not 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.360
 you know that lemon juice from concentrate 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.759
 flavor and so here as the king of color 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.889
 lemon acid on antioxidant 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.710
 ascorbic acid sweetener 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.849
 natural stevia extract 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.430
 here it is an incomprehensible thing and and not 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.319
 was to make 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.479
 what let's check out but if I won't 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:55.090
 or presence after all in the glass was 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:57.990
 so dirty carrots and so pour 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.610
 a glass is still to be seen 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.990
 Let's start to tear down as she eventually all 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:09.969
 more expensive it turns out we pour a little bit 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.129
 a little bit purely for the test such 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:16.710
 transparent very weak new color very 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.710
 slightly transparent h-moll dyes 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.949
 principle basically cool by the way they have 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:33.619
 in my opinion this citrus he was not 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.930
 just a lemon in my opinion was me 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:42.610
 liked citrus rosary compose wrong 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:46.539
 cool it seems not normal ok 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:52.430
 you can drink at least not nasty 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:56.199
 so let's check out anyone else 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.199
 dark what count practically 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.680
 well lipton he has a very pronounced 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.490
 lemon that is very audible well 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.410
 I felt strongly and it is sweeter 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:27.479
 there is probably more sugar added here and 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:31.350
 more acid added citric acid yes he 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:35.509
 very sweet and he still knits a little bit 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.509
 mouth no like it very much 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.160
 Yes, I prefer the place to taste 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.410
 it is certainly a bit more expensive but by 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.250
 the taste is clean it is no longer on if 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.770
 I liked it so I give the victory 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.930
 I like lipton green and maybe 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.639
 be and generally do here are green if 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.010
 there would be a green neptune he was mor 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.500
 would probably win what he likes 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.300
 really cool oldag lemons some 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.580
 I didnâ€™t like, I remember that I didnâ€™t like 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.580
 but I decided to try it 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.000
 specifically to make sure yet 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.860
 time and again compare the gear here well 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.090
 still carry with orange only from 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.200
 strange comparison but don't care 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.110
 subscribe to the channel write to 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.840
 comments what else to compare 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:32.060
 dislike likes in general be active 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.060
 in life bye
