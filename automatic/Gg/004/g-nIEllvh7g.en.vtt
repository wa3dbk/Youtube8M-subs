we build brands the better change the
way<00:00:08.230> human<00:00:08.559> behavior<00:00:08.969> most<00:00:09.969> brands<00:00:10.269> do<00:00:10.450> this

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
way human behavior most brands do this

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.240 
way human behavior most brands do this
for<00:00:10.720> advertising<00:00:11.140> messages<00:00:11.800> have<00:00:11.980> changed

the<00:00:12.309> way<00:00:12.400> we<00:00:12.519> think<00:00:12.670> and<00:00:12.850> feel<00:00:13.050> we<00:00:14.050> know<00:00:14.170> that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
the way we think and feel we know that

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.230 
the way we think and feel we know that
we<00:00:14.590> hope<00:00:14.800> that<00:00:15.099> by<00:00:15.250> changing<00:00:15.670> attitude<00:00:16.090> we

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
we hope that by changing attitude we

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.490 
we hope that by changing attitude we
might<00:00:16.390> change<00:00:16.599> the<00:00:16.689> way<00:00:16.779> people<00:00:16.810> act<00:00:17.170> the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
might change the way people act the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100 
might change the way people act the
people<00:00:17.710> might<00:00:17.890> buy<00:00:18.099> something<00:00:18.369> as<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.580> result

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
people might buy something as a result

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.240 
people might buy something as a result
but<00:00:20.110> this<00:00:20.230> is<00:00:20.500> this<00:00:20.619> really<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.890> right<00:00:21.070> way<00:00:21.190> to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
but this is this really the right way to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.920 
but this is this really the right way to
think<00:00:21.369> about<00:00:21.670> things<00:00:21.940> lots<00:00:22.330> of<00:00:22.420> new<00:00:22.539> thinking

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
think about things lots of new thinking

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.840 
think about things lots of new thinking
like<00:00:23.170> behavioral<00:00:23.560> economics<00:00:24.070> places

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
like behavioral economics places

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.160 
like behavioral economics places
increasing<00:00:25.300> importance<00:00:25.779> on<00:00:25.930> things<00:00:26.109> like

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
increasing importance on things like

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.140 
increasing importance on things like
behavioral<00:00:26.590> interaction<00:00:27.190> of<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:27.850> message

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
behavioral interaction of a message

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.140 
behavioral interaction of a message
transmission<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:30.310> if<00:00:30.460> we<00:00:30.699> didn't<00:00:31.000> build

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
transmission what if we didn't build

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.029 
transmission what if we didn't build
brands<00:00:31.539> as<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.990> message<00:00:32.289> transmission<00:00:32.649> devices

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
brands as a message transmission devices

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.370 
brands as a message transmission devices
but<00:00:33.730> it's<00:00:33.850> a<00:00:33.879> series<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.329> interactions<00:00:34.690> would

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
but it's a series of interactions would

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.900 
but it's a series of interactions would
that<00:00:35.530> be<00:00:35.620> better<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:36.100> how<00:00:36.250> we<00:00:36.309> might<00:00:36.520> and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
that be better and how we might and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.030 
that be better and how we might and
might<00:00:37.059> we<00:00:37.149> do<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.630> think<00:00:38.079> so<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.770> I<00:00:38.890> think

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
might we do it I think so and I think

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.170 
might we do it I think so and I think
there's<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.220> great<00:00:39.370> clue<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.730> how<00:00:39.850> we<00:00:39.910> how<00:00:40.149> we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
there's a great clue to how we how we

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.620 
there's a great clue to how we how we
might<00:00:40.390> achieve<00:00:40.480> this<00:00:41.700> John<00:00:42.700> Holmes<00:00:42.969> ago<00:00:43.270> first

gaming's<00:00:56.469> outstrip<00:00:56.860> both<00:00:57.010> music<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.399> films

so<00:00:59.800> let's<00:00:59.950> just<00:01:00.100> define<00:01:00.190> what<00:01:00.370> we<00:01:00.640> mean<00:01:00.670> by<00:01:00.850> a

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
so let's just define what we mean by a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.360 
so let's just define what we mean by a
game<00:01:01.270> I<00:01:01.570> love<00:01:02.379> this<00:01:02.500> definition<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.100> think<00:01:03.250> it's

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
game I love this definition I think it's

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.490 
game I love this definition I think it's
the<00:01:03.520> essence<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.879> what<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> game<00:01:04.329> is<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.780> game<00:01:05.350> is

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
the essence of what a game is a game is

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.050 
the essence of what a game is a game is
an<00:01:05.560> irresistible<00:01:05.860> problem<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.639> we<00:01:06.729> love<00:01:06.909> to

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the way we behave to the point where

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.699 
the way we behave to the point where
some<00:02:19.930> people<00:02:20.050> might<00:02:20.290> even<00:02:20.319> call<00:02:20.680> it

irrational<00:02:21.120> now<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.180> think<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:22.660> things

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
irrational now you think about things

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.360 
irrational now you think about things
like<00:02:23.220> Nike+<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:25.000> eco-drive<00:02:25.569> for<00:02:26.260> square<00:02:26.590> they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
like Nike+ for eco-drive for square they

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.400 
like Nike+ for eco-drive for square they
all<00:02:27.550> use<00:02:27.819> they're<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:28.630> games<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.110> use<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
all use they're all games that use a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.140 
all use they're all games that use a
series<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.800> interactions<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.760> change<00:02:31.000> our

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
series of interactions to change our

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.530 
series of interactions to change our
behavior<00:02:32.340> now<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:33.790> brands<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.390> learn

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
behavior now I think brands can learn

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.300

from<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.080> think<00:02:35.410> games<00:02:35.650> provide<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.040> new

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
from this I think games provide a new

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.880 
from this I think games provide a new
model<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.000> way<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:37.239> build<00:02:37.450> brands<00:02:37.900> now<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
to go through this in four steps right

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.160 
to go through this in four steps right
so<00:02:56.920> first<00:02:57.430> step<00:02:57.700> we're<00:02:58.510> going<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.720> select<00:02:58.900> a
