00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.580
 good afternoon i would like this 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.730
 video show the tweak difference 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 from the ground between africa hum from sweet and 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 xp gold maxx power 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.310
 with them aska and phisher 7 out of 5 and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.390
 other devices 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.910
 that is, the category is about the same but 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 ground leveling 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.529
 completely different now you will see it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.460
 in order to show it i have 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.219
 a piece of magnetite now show that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.129
 it does not show magnetism as desired. 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.079
 blasting 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.950
 several coins for that night copper coin 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.550
 earring 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.100
 Vitorgan under the mountain of grams and in thunder 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.320
 gold chain 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.789
 Turn on the device as a science I put 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.379
 almost maximum 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.520
 sensitivity to red sector 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:06.049
 so on the river 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.700
 set the same sensitivity 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:14.610
 now we will maximize both of these 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.580
 here's an imitation of our soil then 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:31.770
 is there a magnet reacts or which 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:34.470
 reacts almost reaching 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.140
 juror it also works 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.120
 once and do not ask for a decoction point on the red 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.210
 who to come together 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.980
 here she is almost silent a little 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.980
 click a little bit more 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:54.240
 Everything is now Eureka. Iâ€™m setting it up. 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:02:03.420
 and here we have autotune include 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 from friends all grabbed and on 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.710
 fixed screwed that is with us 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.580
 Now both devices from this magnetite 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.470
 like imitations gross rebuilt very 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 now for the detection range here 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:22.130
 us chain 2 thunderous age by you 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.130
 something about 10 centimeters 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:36.060
 the look is similar to an earring detailed 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:37.980
 a half centimeters musk before the 15th century 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.570
 maybe a little less than those 13 centimeters 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.770
 maybe 14 we are from you on and small 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.440
 okay I found 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.020
 now we will create a situation like her 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.780
 there is something there 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.790
 lure it to you ground heavy hands 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.020
 we will allow mineralized 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.940
 lying coin brass garden kopecks like 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:10.140
 with three pennies from the time a little less 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.239
 what gmp says detects principle 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.800
 signaling can be searched for 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.800
 digging and in what genre already 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:30.620
 10 kopecks Ukrainian they already 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.209
 lost in the support and to the back that with 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:38.150
 black is not aware of something is not that 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.020
 in fact in some centimeters 5 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.510
 sees coins for euryk completely not 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.489
 the problem is how were these 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:54.880
 I don't know centimeter 18 to 20 so they don't 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.880
 left three gas water i 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:15.440
 Grp what is inarticulate I would 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.500
 what number do not know any 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:26.210
 Rebecca normally sees and magnets and 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:28.730
 actually do not care well and finally the chain 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.710
 gp 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:38.040
 naturally he already died here appointed 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.020
 shale Riga will not see eureka magnificently until 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.000
 us actually a coin for africa 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.669
 ceased to exist after she 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.669
 shit from him 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.260
 starting from a small coin continuing 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.320
 chain earrings 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.020
 that is, small goals he stops seeing 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.290
 only see him at point-blank wafer all 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.290
 difference
