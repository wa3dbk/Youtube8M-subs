trying to pair the device to other
Bluetooth<00:01:32.799> devices<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.509> let's<00:01:34.959> go<00:01:35.170> through

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
Bluetooth devices so let's go through

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.230 
Bluetooth devices so let's go through
the<00:01:35.409> pairing<00:01:35.740> process<00:01:35.770> first<00:01:36.459> first<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:37.029> turned

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the pairing process first first I turned

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.019 
the pairing process first first I turned
it<00:01:37.359> on<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.749> so<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.499> power<00:01:38.679> is<00:01:38.829> on<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.850> what<00:01:39.999> I

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
it on and so the power is on and what I

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:41.999 
it on and so the power is on and what I
do<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.539> I'm<00:01:40.689> going<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.990> put<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:41.439> into<00:01:41.679> pairing

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
do is I'm going to put this into pairing

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.309 
do is I'm going to put this into pairing
mode<00:01:42.039> when<00:01:42.579> I<00:01:42.609> do<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:43.179> is<00:01:43.509> push<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.109> plus
