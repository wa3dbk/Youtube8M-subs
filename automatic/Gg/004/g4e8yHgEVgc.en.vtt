00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.760
 the police in hesse have to do everything 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.200
 seriously but also take a bit sporty 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790
 there you probably thought that one 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 sporty cut dare doing 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 so could help such a car as you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 Nowadays the meeting is on and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.609
 window small but everything hard 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.240
 Windschnittig but he looks after 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.289
 a € 24 million expensive 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.300
 truant for the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.560
 Police officers just do not fit in the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 new police cars say they were considered as 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.809
 the flagship model of the hessian 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.550
 police of the opel insignia up to 800 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 such a strip car wanted that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 Ministry of Interior now but order 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 beats the union of the police 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.250
 alarm because the sports seats are for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 Officials in full montur too tight 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 the trunk too small and the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.780
 all around dangerously bad under 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.129
 conditions of use there begins the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 problem if we are very fast 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.510
 if we drive very fast 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 must respond and contact 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 the view to the side and the view after 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 the rear is clearly limited 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.360
 and that is not good 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.380
 in a survey of the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.900
 police union had many officials 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.790
 the bad marks given to the insignia 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.770
 Practical test failed 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.950
 also because that on and unbuckle through 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.330
 the tight seats are problematic in the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 daily patrol can do it 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.470
 that we come up from a second 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.090
 the other one gets into a situation where 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.570
 we leave the vehicle in a flash 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.310
 have to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.250
 then it is natural for us 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.770
 elementary meaning that we fast 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.340
 purposefully targeted the vehicle 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.829
 leave 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.020
 the defects from the point of view of the union 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.670
 are they seriously the opposition in the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 Diet now wants to know if the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.210
 stripe car before the order is not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 was tested sufficiently 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.799
 after all, it's about a total volume 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.689
 of up to 24 million euros 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.770
 since it is also a lot of money money the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.360
 tax payment we can already 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 expect that the Ministry of Interior and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.930
 the technical authority that sensible and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.759
 carefully weigh each other 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 annoying process and the may not 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.909
 on the back of the police officers 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.340
 be carried out it would be right 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.710
 if you order 800 police vehicles 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 for a total value of 25 million euros 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.489
 that there with utmost diligence 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.660
 is done and also a car 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.640
 what will be procured then 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 in operation is also suitable 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.780
 state police chief rejects the charge 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.210
 Back assured you have the vehicle 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.800
 previously tested in patrol and the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.050
 defects considered to be justifiable 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.460
 more than the 200 already delivered 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.740
 but he shared insignia today 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.330
 Surprisingly, the land will be 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.350
 Do not order so understandable 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.700
 we think it over 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.840
 We will be a tender now 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.630
 make for the next year 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.390
 probably go with us in stoner 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.040
 outlook on equipment and payload 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.170
 the way more in compact vans then 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.150
 by the sitting position this problem situation 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.770
 no longer have the car manufacturer opel 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.000
 threatened with a millionaire order 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.920
 break away 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.380
 because actually wanted the country yes 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.000
 to order 800 new insignia and 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.730
 understanding in the company headquarters in 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.530
 Rüsselsheim quote was the all-round view 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.420
 by the strict specifications of the police 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.980
 concerning the necessary special 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.170
 installations in the luggage room area 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.820
 limited this limitation can 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.580
 therefore not on the vehicle itself 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.170
 The now also be returned 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.820
 be criticized sports seats 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.470
 were ordered explicitly 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.540
 that confirms even that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.170
 Ministry of the Interior but the requirements 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.330
 would have changed 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.500
 currently is the wish situation 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.560
 the colleagues a little higher 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.150
 seated a straight seating position he 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.060
 the compact van in the foreground 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.459
 the race for a lucrative police 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.459
 order starts from scratch
