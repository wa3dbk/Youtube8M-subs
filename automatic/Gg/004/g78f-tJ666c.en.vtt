we over driving it temperature wise
because<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.439> was<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> messing<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
because I was a messing about the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
because I was a messing about the
calibration<00:00:30.029> because<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.539> thermocouple<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I was using to monitor the tip

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
I was using to monitor the tip
temperature<00:00:32.969> wasn't<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.570> accurate<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
temperature wasn't that accurate and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.740 
temperature wasn't that accurate and
when<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.130> start<00:00:35.399> glowing<00:00:35.579> red<00:00:35.880> hot<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.600> whole

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
when I start glowing red hot the whole

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
when I start glowing red hot the whole
iron<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> thought<00:00:37.980> mmm

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
iron bit of thought mmm

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.080 
iron bit of thought mmm
that's<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.660> good<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.829> Julie<00:00:41.219> add<00:00:41.489> element

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that's not good and it Julie add element

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
that's not good and it Julie add element
burnt<00:00:42.300> Oh<00:00:42.510> fortunately<00:00:43.379> supplied<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> couple

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
burnt Oh fortunately supplied a couple

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
burnt Oh fortunately supplied a couple
of<00:00:44.129> Spears<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> spirits

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
about half an inch and what's really

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.620 
about half an inch and what's really
neat<00:01:11.990> I'll<00:01:12.990> show<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.610> in<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.790> form<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> little

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
neat I'll show you in a form of a little

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
neat I'll show you in a form of a little
sketch<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:16.770> -<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> stuff<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
sketch of it or - of that stuff to the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840 
sketch of it or - of that stuff to the
side<00:01:19.130> what's<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.430> neat<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
side what's really neat is the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.109 
side what's really neat is the
construction<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:23.490> core<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
construction because this core with the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.100 
construction because this core with the
heating<00:01:24.560> element<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
heating element on it is actually got a

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
heating element on it is actually got a
cross-sectional<00:01:28.110> profile<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:30.030> those<00:01:30.420> very

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
cross-sectional profile that those very

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.859 
cross-sectional profile that those very
small<00:01:30.840> damages<00:01:31.500> only<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.840> half

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
small damages only about two and a half

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440 
small damages only about two and a half
millimeters<00:01:34.619> diameter<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.310> would<00:01:35.490> say<00:01:35.729> it's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
millimeters diameter I would say it's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
millimeters diameter I would say it's
got<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:37.020> distinct<00:01:37.530> holes<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
got three distinct holes right down the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.600 
got three distinct holes right down the
middle<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> core<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.950> holes<00:01:41.250> are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
middle of the core and the holes are

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
middle of the core and the holes are
used<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> wires<00:01:42.439> two<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> them<00:01:43.710> are<00:01:43.829> used

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
used for the wires two of them are used

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
used for the wires two of them are used
for<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> thermocouple<00:01:44.970> let<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.600> find<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
for a thermocouple let me find the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.359 
for a thermocouple let me find the
thermocouple<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.710> here's<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
thermocouple here here's the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.760 
thermocouple here here's the
thermocouple<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.229> they<00:01:49.229> basically<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.740> down

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
thermocouple and they basically go down

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.730 
thermocouple and they basically go down
to<00:01:50.250> those<00:01:50.460> holes<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.960> other<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
to those holes and the other one is to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.370 
to those holes and the other one is to
feed<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.130> end<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> heating<00:01:53.970> element<00:01:54.380> at

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
feed this end of the heating element at

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
feed this end of the heating element at
the<00:01:55.590> end<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> thermocouple

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the end here so you get the thermocouple

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
the end here so you get the thermocouple
is<00:01:58.229> threaded<00:01:58.649> through<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> bead

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
is threaded through this with the bead

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.010 
is threaded through this with the bead
at<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> end<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.780> thermocouple<00:02:01.590> works<00:02:02.100> by

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
at the end a thermocouple works by

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
at the end a thermocouple works by
joining<00:02:04.020> two<00:02:04.439> dissimilar<00:02:04.829> metals<00:02:05.369> together

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.819 
joining two dissimilar metals together
in<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.689> case<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> think<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
in the case of this one I think it's a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.219 
in the case of this one I think it's a
k-type<00:02:08.250> thermocouple<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:09.030> certainly<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.450> shall

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
k-type thermocouple as certainly I shall

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.920 
k-type thermocouple as certainly I shall
shoved<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.430> into<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.910> key<00:02:12.390> type<00:02:12.599> thermocouple

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
shoved it into a key type thermocouple

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.740 
shoved it into a key type thermocouple
unit<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.879> should<00:02:15.090> exactly<00:02:15.420> same

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
unit and it should exactly same

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.500 
unit and it should exactly same
temperature<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.590> ballistics<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.550> M<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.000> would

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
temperature and ballistics so M I would

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
temperature and ballistics so M I would
say<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.379> key<00:02:19.860> type<00:02:20.069> thermocouple

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
say this is a key type thermocouple

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
say this is a key type thermocouple
since<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.120> one<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.480> most<00:02:21.599> common<00:02:21.989> types

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
since it's one of the most common types

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.960 
since it's one of the most common types
and<00:02:22.590> therefore<00:02:23.129> one<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.370> cheapest<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and therefore one of the cheapest and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.720 
and therefore one of the cheapest and
this<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.870> basically<00:02:25.230> two<00:02:25.470> bits<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> wire<00:02:26.040> one

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
to measure using a an op-amp which it I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110 
to measure using a an op-amp which it I
noticed<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.709> unit<00:03:17.100> has<00:03:17.130> two<00:03:17.400> op<00:03:17.579> amps<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:18.000> it

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
noticed that unit has two op amps in it

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.479 
noticed that unit has two op amps in it
possibly<00:03:18.959> one<00:03:19.170> op<00:03:19.319> amp<00:03:19.560> for<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.859> iron<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.370> one

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
possibly one op amp for the iron and one

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.120 
possibly one op amp for the iron and one
op<00:03:20.639> amp<00:03:20.850> for<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> heat<00:03:21.389> gun<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
op amp for the heat gun so the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.039 
op amp for the heat gun so the
thermocouple<00:03:23.730> very<00:03:24.000> simple<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.840> shot

down<00:03:25.079> through<00:03:25.500> those<00:03:25.620> holes<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.790> other<00:03:27.120> wire

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
down through those holes the other wire

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.699 
down through those holes the other wire
comes<00:03:27.660> up<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.109> heating<00:03:28.350> element<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.699 
resistance of these wires and here here
they<00:03:57.239> are<00:03:57.269> here<00:03:57.630> there's<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> sort<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.349> little

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
they are here there's a sort of little

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.680 
they are here there's a sort of little
Junction<00:03:59.370> here<00:03:59.549> in<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.700> middle<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.540> they're

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
Junction here in the middle so they're

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.500 
Junction here in the middle so they're
about<00:04:00.930> say<00:04:01.500> 3<00:04:01.799> inches<00:04:01.829> 75<00:04:02.700> millimeters<00:04:03.269> long

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
about say 3 inches 75 millimeters long

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.620 
about say 3 inches 75 millimeters long
maybe<00:04:04.290> 80<00:04:04.769> millimeters<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.489> one<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.540> them

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
maybe 80 millimeters and one of them

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.830 
maybe 80 millimeters and one of them
measured<00:04:07.019> at<00:04:07.430> point<00:04:08.430> 4<00:04:08.730> ohms<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.239> one<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.780> the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
measured at point 4 ohms and one of the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.110 
measured at point 4 ohms and one of the
measure<00:04:10.049> at<00:04:10.230> 2<00:04:10.470> ohms<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.370> Toolman<00:04:11.819> will<00:04:12.030> be

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
measure at 2 ohms so the Toolman will be

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.640 
measure at 2 ohms so the Toolman will be
the<00:04:12.209> heating<00:04:12.450> element<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.349> other<00:04:13.500> one

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
the heating element and the other one

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.039 
the heating element and the other one
will<00:04:13.829> just<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.340> general<00:04:14.700> conductor<00:04:15.299> M<00:04:15.510> and

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
will just be the general conductor M and

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.900 
will just be the general conductor M and
I'm<00:04:16.470> guessing<00:04:16.829> that<00:04:16.859> they<00:04:17.130> probably<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.760> this

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
I'm guessing that they probably do this

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.339 
I'm guessing that they probably do this
because<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.359> would<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.510> quite<00:04:18.750> hard<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.200> make<00:04:19.320> a

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
because it would be quite hard to make a

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.719 
because it would be quite hard to make a
good<00:04:19.530> electrical<00:04:19.890> connection<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.609> was

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
good electrical connection that was

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.230 
good electrical connection that was
reliable<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.419> wanted<00:04:22.349> each<00:04:22.500> element<00:04:22.890> because

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
reliable I wanted each element because

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.680 
reliable I wanted each element because
it<00:04:23.330> probably<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.780> weak<00:04:23.960> spot<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.330> it's<00:04:26.330> all<00:04:26.509> so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
it probably a weak spot so it's all so

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.820 
it probably a weak spot so it's all so
you<00:04:26.750> can't<00:04:26.990> really<00:04:27.110> soldier<00:04:27.530> on<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.740> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
you can't really soldier on to the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.370 
you can't really soldier on to the
element<00:04:28.280> because<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:28.699> probably<00:04:28.940> another<00:04:29.750> of

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
element because it's probably another of

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.950 
element because it's probably another of
them<00:04:31.090> Cromie<00:04:32.090> tape<00:04:32.479> nicholae<00:04:33.020> tape<00:04:33.259> mix<00:04:33.560> so

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
them Cromie tape nicholae tape mix so

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.330 
them Cromie tape nicholae tape mix so
twisting<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> wires<00:04:36.229> together<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:36.889> really

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
twisting the wires together is really

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.890 
twisting the wires together is really
simple<00:04:37.849> way<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.000> making<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.419> good<00:04:38.599> connection

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
simple way of making a good connection

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.290 
simple way of making a good connection
along<00:04:39.319> the<00:04:39.470> fuel<00:04:39.710> length<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:40.300> will

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
along the fuel length and will

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300 
along the fuel length and will
effectually<00:04:42.050> greatly<00:04:42.500> lower<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.860> resistance

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
effectually greatly lower the resistance

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.589 
effectually greatly lower the resistance
of<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:43.880> it's<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.060> good<00:04:44.090> way<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.330> connecting

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
of that so it's a good way of connecting

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.370 
of that so it's a good way of connecting
so<00:04:45.560> at<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.310> bottom<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:48.130> heating<00:04:49.130> element

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
so at the bottom of the heating element

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.200 
so at the bottom of the heating element
they<00:04:51.380> twist<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.800> wire<00:04:51.979> on<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.639> just<00:04:53.000> runs

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
they twist a wire on and it just runs

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.600 
they twist a wire on and it just runs
down<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.599> outside<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.319> shaft<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:54.949> the

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
down the outside of the shaft and the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.610 
down the outside of the shaft and the
other<00:04:55.729> end<00:04:56.000> it's<00:04:56.389> twisted<00:04:56.840> on<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.259> then<00:04:57.500> the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
other end it's twisted on and then the

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.320 
other end it's twisted on and then the
twisted<00:04:58.039> wires<00:04:58.250> actually<00:04:58.550> shove<00:04:59.000> down<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
twisted wires actually shove down the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.930 
twisted wires actually shove down the
middle<00:04:59.509> and<00:04:59.750> down<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:00.440> third<00:05:00.680> hole<00:05:00.949> so<00:05:01.909> you

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
middle and down the third hole so you

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.559 
middle and down the third hole so you
end<00:05:02.180> up<00:05:02.360> with<00:05:02.569> four<00:05:03.080> wires<00:05:03.319> on<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.650> bottom<00:05:04.569> the

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
end up with four wires on the bottom the

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:06.850 
end up with four wires on the bottom the
two<00:05:05.750> heating<00:05:06.050> element<00:05:06.259> wires<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.710> two

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
two heating element wires in the two

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.279 
two heating element wires in the two
thermocouple<00:05:07.430> wires<00:05:07.900> these<00:05:08.900> are<00:05:09.139> then

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
thermocouple wires these are then

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.980 
thermocouple wires these are then
sleeved<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.220> this<00:05:10.430> outer<00:05:10.639> sleeve<00:05:11.030> which<00:05:11.750> just

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
sleeved in this outer sleeve which just

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.430 
sleeved in this outer sleeve which just

ceramic cement to the you are yeah thats

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.680 
ceramic cement to the you are yeah thats
it<00:05:45.440> wraps<00:05:45.740> really<00:05:45.979> hard<00:05:46.159> on<00:05:46.370> who<00:05:46.849> our<00:05:47.030> soldier

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
it wraps really hard on who our soldier

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.980 
it wraps really hard on who our soldier
on<00:05:48.580> elements<00:05:49.580> come<00:05:49.820> with<00:05:50.000> this<00:05:50.120> neat<00:05:50.960> little

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
on elements come with this neat little

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.649 
on elements come with this neat little
base<00:05:51.650> at<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.919> bottom<00:05:52.210> but<00:05:53.210> I<00:05:53.240> noticed<00:05:53.599> that

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
base at the bottom but I noticed that

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.899 
base at the bottom but I noticed that
not<00:05:53.810> all<00:05:54.020> iron<00:05:54.440> elements<00:05:55.069> have<00:05:55.280> this<00:05:55.520> just

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
not all iron elements have this just

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.820 
not all iron elements have this just
seems<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.240> be<00:05:56.270> fairly<00:05:56.960> unique<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.440> a<00:05:57.469> few

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
seems to be fairly unique to a few

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.240 
seems to be fairly unique to a few
different<00:05:58.639> types<00:05:58.819> so<00:05:59.750> since<00:06:00.650> this<00:06:00.830> is<00:06:01.009> just

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
different types so since this is just

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.339 
different types so since this is just
completely<00:06:01.969> separate<00:06:02.900> from<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:03.229> main

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
completely separate from the main

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.320 
completely separate from the main
construction<00:06:04.069> and<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.909> they're<00:06:05.210> just

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
construction and and they're just

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.830 
construction and and they're just
basically<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:07.090> cement<00:06:08.090> on<00:06:08.300> again<00:06:08.630> and

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
basically the the cement on again and

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.600 
basically the the cement on again and
this<00:06:09.319> is<00:06:09.380> a<00:06:09.500> bit<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.830> sits<00:06:10.039> over<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.310> circuit

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
this is a bit that sits over the circuit

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.990 
this is a bit that sits over the circuit
board<00:06:10.789> I'd<00:06:11.389> say<00:06:11.750> that<00:06:11.900> if<00:06:11.990> you<00:06:12.139> have<00:06:13.000> an

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
board I'd say that if you have an

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.629 
board I'd say that if you have an
element<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:14.930> may<00:06:15.199> be<00:06:15.259> worth<00:06:15.590> a<00:06:15.800> dead<00:06:16.039> element

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
element it may be worth a dead element

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.730 
element it may be worth a dead element
it<00:06:16.880> might<00:06:17.150> be<00:06:17.270> worth<00:06:17.449> them<00:06:17.780> salvaging<00:06:18.620> this

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
it might be worth them salvaging this

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.379 
it might be worth them salvaging this
little<00:06:18.949> bit<00:06:19.069> off<00:06:19.219> the<00:06:19.250> bottom<00:06:19.729> of<00:06:19.819> it<00:06:19.969> just<00:06:20.240> as

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
little bit off the bottom of it just as

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.689 
little bit off the bottom of it just as
our<00:06:20.539> spear<00:06:21.080> in<00:06:21.620> case<00:06:21.949> you<00:06:22.099> ever<00:06:22.250> find<00:06:22.580> you

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
our spear in case you ever find you

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.520 
our spear in case you ever find you
can't<00:06:22.909> get<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.419> elements<00:06:23.960> with<00:06:24.110> this<00:06:24.259> bit<00:06:24.440> in

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
can't get the elements with this bit in

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.020 
can't get the elements with this bit in
the<00:06:24.620> bottom<00:06:24.740> because<00:06:25.099> then<00:06:25.370> this<00:06:25.550> bit<00:06:25.849> could

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
the bottom because then this bit could

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.640 
the bottom because then this bit could
be<00:06:26.120> made<00:06:26.270> captive<00:06:26.780> to<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:26.930> circuit<00:06:27.259> board<00:06:27.289> and

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
be made captive to the circuit board and

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.430 
be made captive to the circuit board and
you<00:06:28.520> could<00:06:28.669> just<00:06:28.819> use<00:06:29.210> an<00:06:29.449> element<00:06:30.080> without

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
you could just use an element without

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.050 
you could just use an element without
that<00:06:30.860> base

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
that base

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.550 
that base
and<00:06:33.180> I<00:06:33.419> really<00:06:33.720> think<00:06:33.960> that<00:06:34.169> pretty<00:06:34.470> much

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
and I really think that pretty much

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.190 
and I really think that pretty much
covers<00:06:34.710> it<00:06:35.130> really<00:06:35.639> it's<00:06:36.300> a<00:06:36.630> very<00:06:36.660> simple

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
covers it really it's a very simple

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.409 
covers it really it's a very simple
construction<00:06:37.350> and<00:06:38.160> very<00:06:38.430> neat<00:06:38.700> it's

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
construction and very neat it's

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.220 
construction and very neat it's
obviously<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:40.730> evolved<00:06:41.730> over<00:06:41.970> time<00:06:42.210> but<00:06:43.050> it

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
obviously a evolved over time but it

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.320 
obviously a evolved over time but it
means<00:06:43.560> that<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:44.010> heat<00:06:44.250> is<00:06:44.430> concentrated<00:06:45.210> at

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
means that the heat is concentrated at

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.270 
means that the heat is concentrated at
the<00:06:45.419> end<00:06:45.540> of<00:06:45.690> this<00:06:45.810> and<00:06:46.080> it's<00:06:46.410> also<00:06:46.590> sensed

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
the end of this and it's also sensed

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.520 
the end of this and it's also sensed
using<00:06:47.580> the<00:06:47.669> thermocouple<00:06:48.240> at<00:06:48.300> the<00:06:48.419> end<00:06:48.540> and<00:06:48.780> I

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
using the thermocouple at the end and I

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.020 
using the thermocouple at the end and I
should<00:06:49.740> add<00:06:49.860> that<00:06:49.889> thermocouples<00:06:50.639> are<00:06:50.730> rated

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
should add that thermocouples are rated

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.180 
should add that thermocouples are rated
up<00:06:51.150> to<00:06:51.210> thousands<00:06:52.200> of<00:06:52.320> degrees<00:06:52.470> centigrade<00:06:53.160> so

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
up to thousands of degrees centigrade so

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.760 
up to thousands of degrees centigrade so
yeah<00:06:53.910> that<00:06:54.480> makes<00:06:54.690> them<00:06:54.900> very<00:06:55.050> well-suited<00:06:55.620> to

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
yeah that makes them very well-suited to

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.180 
yeah that makes them very well-suited to
the<00:06:55.919> high<00:06:56.070> temperatures<00:06:56.580> of<00:06:56.669> an<00:06:56.760> hour<00:06:56.990> so

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
the high temperatures of an hour so

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.220 
the high temperatures of an hour so
another<00:06:59.190> thing<00:06:59.400> worth<00:06:59.520> noting<00:06:59.760> this<00:07:00.510> is<00:07:00.660> a<00:07:00.690> 24

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
another thing worth noting this is a 24

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.800 
another thing worth noting this is a 24
volt<00:07:01.260> element<00:07:01.830> 50<00:07:02.190> watt<00:07:02.370> and<00:07:02.639> it's<00:07:03.450> fed<00:07:03.660> with

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
volt element 50 watt and it's fed with

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
an AC supply from the red letters former

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.500 
an AC supply from the red letters former

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
via triac which is a optically cut

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.990

optically coupled with an opto track to

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.680 
optically coupled with an opto track to
the<00:07:12.870> control<00:07:13.500> circuitry<00:07:13.889> that<00:07:14.330> since<00:07:15.330> former

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
the control circuitry that since former

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.290 
the control circuitry that since former
has<00:07:15.930> a<00:07:15.960> winding<00:07:16.710> with<00:07:16.830> about<00:07:17.070> 32<00:07:17.880> volts

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
has a winding with about 32 volts

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.450 
has a winding with about 32 volts
upwards<00:07:18.720> on<00:07:18.840> it<00:07:18.990> that's<00:07:19.740> actually<00:07:20.070> for<00:07:20.370> their

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
upwards on it that's actually for their

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.850 
upwards on it that's actually for their
element<00:07:20.820> and<00:07:21.030> I<00:07:21.240> thought<00:07:21.570> that<00:07:21.750> was<00:07:21.960> to<00:07:22.440> force

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
element and I thought that was to force

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.469 
element and I thought that was to force
the<00:07:23.010> element<00:07:23.310> heater<00:07:23.520> be<00:07:23.729> a<00:07:23.760> bit<00:07:23.880> faster<00:07:24.300> but

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
the element heater be a bit faster but

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.980 
the element heater be a bit faster but
in<00:07:24.570> reality<00:07:24.720> when<00:07:25.590> I<00:07:25.710> measured<00:07:26.250> it<00:07:26.370> and<00:07:26.990> when

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
in reality when I measured it and when

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.260 
in reality when I measured it and when
the<00:07:28.110> element<00:07:28.440> was<00:07:28.560> running<00:07:28.860> I<00:07:29.010> found<00:07:29.760> that<00:07:30.030> the

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
the element was running I found that the

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.300 
the element was running I found that the
higher<00:07:30.960> voltage<00:07:31.139> in<00:07:31.500> the<00:07:31.560> transformer<00:07:32.130> is

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
higher voltage in the transformer is

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.250 
higher voltage in the transformer is
just<00:07:32.520> compensate<00:07:33.240> for<00:07:33.389> the<00:07:33.479> fact<00:07:33.690> that<00:07:33.900> the

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.260 
just compensate for the fact that the

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.110 
just compensate for the fact that the
there<00:07:35.010> will<00:07:35.100> be<00:07:35.130> losses<00:07:35.430> in<00:07:35.700> the<00:07:35.790> cable

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
there will be losses in the cable

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.330 
there will be losses in the cable
because<00:07:36.389> of<00:07:36.510> quite<00:07:36.690> thin<00:07:36.960> cables<00:07:37.410> so<00:07:38.130> by<00:07:38.280> the

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
because of quite thin cables so by the

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.130 
because of quite thin cables so by the
time<00:07:38.520> it<00:07:38.669> gets<00:07:38.820> to<00:07:39.030> the<00:07:39.120> end<00:07:39.300> here<00:07:39.539> is<00:07:39.840> pretty

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.140 
time it gets to the end here is pretty

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.920 
time it gets to the end here is pretty
much<00:07:40.410> about<00:07:40.680> 25<00:07:41.310> volts<00:07:41.729> which<00:07:41.880> is<00:07:42.090> fine<00:07:42.630> for

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
much about 25 volts which is fine for

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.030 
much about 25 volts which is fine for
this<00:07:43.020> element<00:07:43.440> and<00:07:43.620> oh<00:07:44.280> very<00:07:44.910> interesting
