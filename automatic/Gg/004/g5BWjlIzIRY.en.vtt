00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 today is the exciting day today 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 The 10,000 cash project was presented 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.329
 which stood on the intermot the kawasaki 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 and we are very curious about that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 audience reacted 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.290
 I hope we have something reasonable 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.739
 Delivered around five months have been 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.400
 the start to the kawasaki lsl 10,000 box 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.000
 project you passed the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.559
 development phases the different ones 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.629
 follow development phases 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 I ask my colleagues now the curtain 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.120
 to ventilate and give us the result of our 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.120
 work together to look at work 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.910
 missing is clearly recognizable that everyone 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.770
 live is a standard 10,000 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.170
 that this is not the same anymore 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.460
 where certain components are the same 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.240
 have stayed and are aware 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.430
 stayed the same 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.840
 we have the different ones 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.040
 development phases with our with 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.500
 our film crew lived we have them 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.150
 recorded what was sent to you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.710
 the special challenge of this 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.610
 work because that's the first time in 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 Germany has been like this 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.150
 Generally in the motorcycle industry and also 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.650
 the first time for us for you 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.570
 what was the special challenge? 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.119
 in this kind of work 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.860
 that was very special for all of us 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.290
 We had to be there on the spot 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.700
 had to have everything prepared properly 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.900
 And that day must have something 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.540
 to happen with it certain 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.910
 work progress could show so 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.220
 That was a requirement I so before 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.990
 did not judge us and they are real 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.360
 but I have asked ourselves 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 went well from 6 october goes 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.810
 the auction off for this 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.790
 motorcycle is auctioned what we say 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.740
 can from this proceeds the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.580
 auctioning with a good purpose 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.410
 flow into 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.390
 we will still be on our 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.140
 usual channels then even closer 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.200
 discuss 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.040
 the auction phase ends on 6 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.630
 Isl and kawasaki are over here 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.150
 the intermot's response was huge 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.300
 We were very excited about the onslaught on 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.010
 kawasaki was still looking forward to the hall 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.880

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.090
