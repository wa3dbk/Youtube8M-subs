giving it a nice premium taste but it is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.620 
giving it a nice premium taste but it is
rather<00:00:34.200> hollow<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.850> only<00:00:36.059> notable<00:00:36.329> thing

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
rather hollow the only notable thing

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
two triple A batteries sadly though they

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
two triple A batteries sadly though they
don't<00:01:31.409> come<00:01:31.619> included<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> packaging<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
don't come included the packaging so you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
don't come included the packaging so you
have<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> pick<00:01:33.479> them<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.689> yourself<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.710> remote

have to pick them up yourself the remote
control<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.579> basic<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.360> gotta

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
control is pretty basic you just gotta

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
control is pretty basic you just gotta
remember<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.900> point<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.009> unit

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
remember to point it right at the unit

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
remember to point it right at the unit
just<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.150> relies<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.630> IR<00:01:40.110> connection

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
just because it relies an IR connection

incorporated<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.790> has<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
incorporated with that but it has the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.660 
incorporated with that but it has the
USB<00:02:00.390> ports<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.710> says<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> it's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so if you have one you could use it but

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.839 
so if you have one you could use it but
the<00:02:09.869> thing<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.220> actually

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the thing with that is that you actually

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.460 
the thing with that is that you actually
pick<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> bluetooth<00:02:13.020> dry

with<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.660> remote<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.380> could<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> little<00:03:01.860> bit

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
with the remote it could be a little bit

with the remote it could be a little bit
of<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> process<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.790> because<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.600> always

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
of a process just because you always

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.660 
of a process just because you always
have<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.170> remember<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:05.010> point<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.520> remote

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
have to remember to point the remote

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.210 
have to remember to point the remote
towards<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> direction<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.440> unit<00:03:07.830> itself

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
towards the direction of the unit itself

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.370 
towards the direction of the unit itself
so<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.550> receives<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.060> connection<00:03:09.720> but<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
so it receives the connection but the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.770 
so it receives the connection but the
worst<00:03:10.620> part<00:03:11.100> about<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:12.120> inputting
