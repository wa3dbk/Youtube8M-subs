okay<00:01:56.780> there<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.080> go<00:01:58.400> now<00:01:59.400> this<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:00.720> it's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
okay there we go now this is what it's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120 
okay there we go now this is what it's
going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> start<00:02:01.320> doing<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.860> start

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
going to start doing it's gonna start

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.369 
going to start doing it's gonna start
coming<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:03.740> just<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.500 

and<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:11.009> takes<00:02:11.249> a<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.670> bit<00:02:11.969> of<00:02:12.030> time<00:02:12.329> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and this takes a little bit of time you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.819 
and this takes a little bit of time you
got<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.749> be<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:13.079> patient<00:02:13.290> with<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
got to be a little patient with it

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.220 
got to be a little patient with it
sometimes<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.329> actually<00:02:15.510> hold<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
sometimes you can actually hold the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.619 
sometimes you can actually hold the
casing<00:02:16.709> back<00:02:16.889> a<00:02:16.950> little<00:02:17.249> bit<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:18.150> tends<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
casing back a little bit and it tends to

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.600 
casing back a little bit and it tends to
make<00:02:19.379> your<00:02:19.590> sausage<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.069> little<00:02:20.159> bit<00:02:20.549> fuller

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.100 

and<00:02:25.830> actually

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.810 

if<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.680> get<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> little<00:02:30.100> help<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.490> kitchen

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
if you get a little help in the kitchen

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.150 
if you get a little help in the kitchen
that<00:02:30.850> helps<00:02:31.210> too<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:32.860> how<00:02:32.980> we're

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
that helps too but you can see how we're

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.630 
that helps too but you can see how we're
starting<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.580> get<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.880> case<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.930> come<00:02:35.080> out

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.230 

and<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.600> go<00:02:41.670> sometimes<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.880> thing<00:02:43.120> you

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240
