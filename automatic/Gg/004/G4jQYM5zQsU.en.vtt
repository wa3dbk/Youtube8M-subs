beaver who playing Bobby you know let's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.540 
beaver who playing Bobby you know let's
just<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.720> get<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.350> get<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.680> really<00:01:41.950> dive

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
just you get to you get to really dive

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.280 
just you get to you get to really dive
in<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:42.880> explore<00:01:43.240> relationship<00:01:43.870> between<00:01:44.170> two

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
in and explore relationship between two

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.450 
in and explore relationship between two
characters<00:01:44.470> when<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.160> work<00:01:45.310> with

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
characters when you get to work with

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.390 
characters when you get to work with
them<00:01:45.550> more<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.300> think<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.890> introduce

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
them more so I think to to introduce

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.280 
them more so I think to to introduce
characters<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.479> are<00:01:49.600> going<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.780> be<00:01:49.900> around<00:01:50.020> a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
characters that are going to be around a

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.080 
characters that are going to be around a
little<00:01:50.410> bit<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.770> whatever<00:01:51.610> they<00:01:51.820> might<00:01:52.030> be

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
little bit more whatever they might be

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.630 
little bit more whatever they might be
you<00:01:52.930> get<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.229> see<00:01:53.470> more<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.950> dynamic<00:01:54.490> between

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
you get to see more of a dynamic between

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.420 
you get to see more of a dynamic between
those<00:01:55.509> characters<00:01:56.020> between<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.950> two

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
those characters between the two

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.310 
those characters between the two
brothers<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.150> just<00:01:58.360> adds<00:01:58.630> more<00:01:58.750> layers<00:01:59.170> to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
brothers and it just adds more layers to

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.090 
brothers and it just adds more layers to
already<00:02:00.009> very<00:02:00.250> layered<00:02:00.460> show<00:02:00.759> okay<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.380> can

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100
