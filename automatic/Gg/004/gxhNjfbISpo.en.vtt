00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.640
 hi friends today we are going to prepare some 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.820
 new recipes and today we are going to make cream 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.790
 nougat pastry for this cream 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.420
 pastry we will need half a liter 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 milk 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.870
 4 yolks that I already have here beaten 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.260
 only the yolks 4 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.560
 100 grams of sugar 50 grams of 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.780
 cornstarch or corn flour and a tablet 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.090
 of nougat jijona that has 300 grams 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.030
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 put to heat the milk with the nougat 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.020
 so that it melts 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.960
 well we have almost melted in 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.089
 our nougat now we are going to add 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.020
 the sugar so that it melts this 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.870
 also good 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.480
 while melting is finished melting 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.410
 the nougat that remains and nods elite 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.410
 also our other 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 turning down the heat a little so no 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.580
 do not go sticking 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.750
 while it is finished melting our 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.650
 nougat 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.340
 we leave with our buds 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 when 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.090
 we have here the beaten yolks 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.320
 and we are going to add cornstarch that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.320
 It was about 50 grams 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.460
 as you see we already have everything loose and 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.979
 we are going to add it 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.090
 to milk because it is already the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.090
 well dissolved nougat 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.369
 we will put 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.369
 the fire more or less at medium heat 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.340
 we will move from time to time until 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.920
 that thick 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.920
 it's already very thick we put out the fire 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.150
 and we remove 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.129
 well now what are we going to do what 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.129
 let's throw in a container 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.860
 Well, we have our list ready 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.260
 custard of your reds if not the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.210
 let's still use what we 're going to 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.210
 do is put a paper film 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.310
 Well, I 'll quote you so that the part of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.060
 up does not create scab and we'll leave it 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.049
 cool and then we can use it 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.049
 in the dessert that we want 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.470
 good and we have finished our 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.690
 nougat pastry cream I hope that you 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.480
 like it and try to do it as I say 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.710
 always because it's delicious we'll see you 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.710
