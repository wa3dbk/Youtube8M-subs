 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.710
 never 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.309
 and what I'm going to do 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.210
 5 cups of water to boil over medium heat 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.490
 let's add that I will add now 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.070
 green jelly very well 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 We are going to sprinkle it very well 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 you feel 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.960
 grenetina 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.900
 and then let's let this be 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.080
 dissolve little while we're going to 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.790
 see the capsule of the measuring rates and 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.220
 with this we are going to make these sachets 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.200
 who is watching Latino grass from home that 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.330
 they are like a few pesetas so that 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.360
 Chavistas do them and have their fish tank 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.350
 of green or blue gelatin we are going to this 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.350
 capsule pour we come back 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.540
 the measuring houses are a game of 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.570
 small castles that allow us 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.710
 measure liquid and solid ingredients 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.500
 mainly used in baking 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.050
 and bakery although the precision of a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.510
 scale does not compare to have the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.970
 measuring cups of our kitchen can 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.220
 be useful at any time 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.290
 this set of measuring cups is 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.190
 make up of four volume units 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.470
 a quarter an eighth a half and a cup 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.810
 and when handling them are 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.300
 practices for having a flat base and 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.380
 have them all joined by a ring to 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.380
 that are ordered 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.650

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.080
 dissolved the whole grenetine the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.540
 Grenetina dissolves when it enters with 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.610
 a hot ingredient dissolves 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.680
 immediately and that I'm going to add here 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.680
