00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
game now let me actually ask you about

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.249 
game now let me actually ask you about
that<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.299> played<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.659> first<00:02:05.840> one<00:02:05.930> as<00:02:06.110> well

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
that so I played the first one as well

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.380 
that so I played the first one as well
what<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:06.830> find<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.369> I'm<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> little

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
what I find that I I'm a little

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.630 
what I find that I I'm a little
disappointed<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.340> feels

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
disappointed with this is that it feels

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.180 
disappointed with this is that it feels
a<00:02:10.940> little<00:02:11.180> too<00:02:11.840> samey<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.770> like<00:02:12.980> no<00:02:13.160> matter

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
a little too samey it's like no matter

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.400 
a little too samey it's like no matter
which<00:02:13.550> area<00:02:13.970> you're<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.959> three<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
which area you're in in three of the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.809 
which area you're in in three of the
four<00:02:15.560> areas<00:02:15.739> you're<00:02:16.069> kind<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.310> doing<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.610> same

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
four areas you're kind of doing the same

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.890 
four areas you're kind of doing the same
thing<00:02:17.090> you're<00:02:17.239> just<00:02:17.360> drawing<00:02:17.480> from<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.750> deck

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
thing you're just drawing from a deck

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.780 
thing you're just drawing from a deck
and<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> felt<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> first<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:18.830> had<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> bit<00:02:19.670> more

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and I felt the first one had a bit more

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.880 
and I felt the first one had a bit more
storyline<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> bit<00:02:20.780> more<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.560> an<00:02:21.650> adventure

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
storyline a bit more of it an adventure

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.380 
storyline a bit more of it an adventure
feel<00:02:22.310> because<00:02:22.550> each<00:02:22.790> part<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.209> temple

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
feel because each part of the temple

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.150 
feel because each part of the temple
that<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.720> went<00:02:23.870> through<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.890> are<00:02:24.980> doing

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
that you went through you are doing

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.979 
that you went through you are doing
slightly<00:02:25.760> different<00:02:26.330> things<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.810> there<00:02:26.930> were

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
slightly different things and there were

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.350 
slightly different things and there were
different<00:02:27.319> hazards<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.489> one<00:02:28.730> seems<00:02:29.120> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
different hazards and this one seems to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.110 
different hazards and this one seems to
feel<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.900> me<00:02:30.050> kind<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:31.489> could<00:02:31.670> be<00:02:31.790> anywhere

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
feel to me kind of you could be anywhere

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
feel to me kind of you could be anywhere
in<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.330> temple<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.780> you're<00:02:32.959> really<00:02:33.110> just

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
in this temple and you're really just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.750 
in this temple and you're really just
drawing<00:02:33.500> from<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.709> different<00:02:33.980> stack<00:02:34.220> why<00:02:34.610> don't

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
drawing from a different stack why don't

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.190 
drawing from a different stack why don't
what<00:02:34.850> do<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:34.940> think<00:02:35.120> about<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.630> think

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
what do you think about that I think

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.470 
what do you think about that I think
what<00:02:36.350> they've<00:02:36.530> done<00:02:36.769> is<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.550> put<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.060> really

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
what they've done is they put the really

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.740 
what they've done is they put the really
good<00:02:38.840> treasures<00:02:39.500> much<00:02:40.190> further<00:02:40.519> away<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.360> you

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
good treasures much further away so you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.600 
good treasures much further away so you
have<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.989> take<00:02:42.170> bigger<00:02:42.470> Gamble's<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.310> get<00:02:43.459> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
have to take bigger Gamble's to get to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.059 
have to take bigger Gamble's to get to
the<00:02:43.730> bigger<00:02:43.940> treasures<00:02:44.569> rather<00:02:45.440> than<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the bigger treasures rather than the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.130 
the bigger treasures rather than the
somewhat<00:02:46.489> different<00:02:46.880> feel<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.390> things<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:48.019> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
somewhat different feel of things in the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.900 
somewhat different feel of things in the
first<00:02:48.440> game<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:50.620> guess<00:02:51.620> there<00:02:52.010> are<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.610> bit

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
first game so I guess there are is a bit

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.410 
first game so I guess there are is a bit
of<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:54.069> similarity<00:02:55.069> in<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.400> actions<00:02:56.030> but<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
of a similarity in the actions but I

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.360 
of a similarity in the actions but I
think<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:57.170> have<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.350> take<00:02:57.620> bigger<00:02:57.920> risks<00:02:58.010> to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
think you have to take bigger risks to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.830 
think you have to take bigger risks to
get<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.640> bigger<00:02:58.790> treasures<00:02:59.329> and<00:02:59.540> that's<00:02:59.660> what

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
get the bigger treasures and that's what

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.440 
get the bigger treasures and that's what
they<00:02:59.959> replace<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:01.370> old<00:03:01.489> original<00:03:01.670> mechanic

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
they replace the old original mechanic

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.120 
they replace the old original mechanic
in<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.660> game<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.290> first<00:03:03.440> game<00:03:03.829> within

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
in the game in the first game within

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.800 
in the game in the first game within
this<00:03:04.430> game<00:03:04.489> if<00:03:04.880> someone<00:03:05.269> didn't<00:03:05.540> have<00:03:05.660> either

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
this game if someone didn't have either

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.150 
this game if someone didn't have either
one<00:03:06.079> which<00:03:06.350> one<00:03:06.530> would<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.680> recommend<00:03:06.829> they

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
one which one would you recommend they

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.990 
one which one would you recommend they
get<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.850> think<00:03:10.850> probably<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.900> first<00:03:12.320> games

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
get I think probably the first games

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.420 
get I think probably the first games
would<00:03:14.000> still<00:03:14.269> be<00:03:14.390> my<00:03:14.540> choice<00:03:14.780> ok<00:03:15.290> yeah<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.190> like

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
would still be my choice ok yeah I like
