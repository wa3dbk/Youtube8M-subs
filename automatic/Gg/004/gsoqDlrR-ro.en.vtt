themselves the first piece of evidence

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:51.760 
themselves the first piece of evidence
supporting<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:42.909> is

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.010 

the<00:00:52.770> complete<00:00:53.280> fracturing<00:00:53.880> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> field<00:00:54.540> the

the complete fracturing of the field the
strongest<00:00:55.590> bone<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.220> human<00:00:56.250> body

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.100 

yes<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:10.460> loss<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.150> meniscus<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.930> left

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.990 
yes the loss of the meniscus in the left
knee<00:01:12.320> thus<00:01:12.980> we<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.310> deduce<00:01:13.550> that<00:01:13.730> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
knee thus we can deduce that the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.060 
knee thus we can deduce that the
person's<00:01:14.390> weakened<00:01:14.750> skeletal<00:01:15.290> system<00:01:15.650> was

person's weakened skeletal system was

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.860 
person's weakened skeletal system was
due<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.730> side<00:01:16.970> effects<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.750> ash

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870

Finn's<00:01:18.230> drug<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.800> have<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.370> bad<00:01:19.670> feeling<00:01:19.700> about

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
Finn's drug I have a bad feeling about

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
Finn's drug I have a bad feeling about
this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.560 

yes<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:36.130> seems<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.640> these<00:01:36.850> can<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.180> combined

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
yes it seems that these can be combined

mucous membranes and whoever this was
they<00:01:45.250> have<00:01:45.399> been<00:01:45.579> taking<00:01:45.970> large<00:01:46.240> doses<00:01:46.420> of

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
unapproved one it's likely that this

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:02.450 
unapproved one it's likely that this
person<00:01:51.970> was

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.270 

yes<00:02:03.150> this<00:02:04.020> individual<00:02:04.650> had<00:02:04.799> been<00:02:04.950> infected

with some kind of virus that virus
itself<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> case<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.890> cause<00:02:11.100> of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
itself was that's the case the cause of

itself was that's the case the cause of
death<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.090> should<00:02:12.540> stop<00:02:12.750> making

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
death was I should stop making

death was I should stop making
conjectures<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.890> need<00:02:14.340> some<00:02:14.520> hard<00:02:14.760> evidence<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
conjectures I need some hard evidence to

emerging from all over is something

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.949 
emerging from all over is something

wrong oh well we just received the
results<00:02:37.050> from<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> analysis<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.700> says<00:02:39.030> that

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
results from the analysis it says that

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.090 
results from the analysis it says that
the<00:02:39.480> blood<00:02:39.870> stain<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.410> person's<00:02:40.769> clothing

the blood stain on the person's clothing

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.990 
the blood stain on the person's clothing
contain<00:02:41.610> traces<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.269> saliva<00:02:42.810> saliva<00:02:44.000> if

contain traces of saliva saliva if

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.790 
contain traces of saliva saliva if
that's<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.510> case<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.230> blood<00:02:46.470> stain

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
that's the case then that blood stain

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.360 
that's the case then that blood stain
was

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.030 

Wow

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
Wow

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.819 
Wow
yes<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.209> came<00:02:58.510> through<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.810> mouth<00:02:59.019> likely<00:02:59.650> by

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
yes it came through the mouth likely by

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.099 
yes it came through the mouth likely by
being<00:03:00.099> vomited<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:01.420> would<00:03:01.689> explain<00:03:01.989> why

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
being vomited that would explain why

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.780 
being vomited that would explain why
there<00:03:02.439> were<00:03:02.530> no<00:03:02.560> signs<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.099> damage<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.700> the

blood the viral hemorrhagic fever causes

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.899 
blood the viral hemorrhagic fever causes
bleeding<00:03:16.810> from<00:03:17.200> all<00:03:17.319> over<00:03:17.530> both<00:03:18.040> internally

bleeding from all over both internally
and externally<00:03:20.040> vomiting<00:03:21.040> blood<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.579> one<00:03:21.790> of

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
and externally vomiting blood is one of

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.530 
and externally vomiting blood is one of
the<00:03:22.000> signs<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.569> disease<00:03:22.870> as<00:03:23.109> well<00:03:23.459> hmm

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the signs of this disease as well hmm

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.300 
the signs of this disease as well hmm
this<00:03:25.540> person<00:03:25.840> died<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.500> viral<00:03:27.069> hemorrhagic

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
this person died a viral hemorrhagic

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.789 
this person died a viral hemorrhagic
fever<00:03:27.969> the<00:03:28.599> evidence<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.200> I'm<00:03:29.290> drawing<00:03:29.560> that

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
fever the evidence that I'm drawing that

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:39.790 
fever the evidence that I'm drawing that
conclusion<00:03:30.010> from<00:03:30.519> is

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.920 

that's<00:03:40.800> right<00:03:41.010> if<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.150> person<00:03:42.540> was<00:03:42.690> still

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
that's right if this person was still

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.570 
that's right if this person was still
alive<00:03:43.200> after<00:03:43.500> having<00:03:43.950> had<00:03:44.070> an<00:03:44.220> attack<00:03:44.520> of

alive after having had an attack of

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.910 
alive after having had an attack of
vomiting<00:03:45.270> blood<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.260> highly<00:03:46.710> doubt<00:03:46.860> that

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
vomiting blood and I highly doubt that

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.440 
vomiting blood and I highly doubt that
they'd<00:03:47.220> go<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.550> without<00:03:47.730> doing<00:03:48.150> something

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
they'd go on without doing something

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.070 
they'd go on without doing something
about<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.960> bloody<00:03:49.230> clothes<00:03:50.210> thus<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.540> traces

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
about the bloody clothes thus the traces

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.450 
about the bloody clothes thus the traces
of<00:03:52.230> vomited<00:03:52.650> blood<00:03:52.800> on<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.190> clothing

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
of vomited blood on the clothing

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.580 
of vomited blood on the clothing
indicates<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.300> this<00:03:54.510> person<00:03:54.720> died<00:03:55.140> soon

indicates that this person died soon

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:05.510 
indicates that this person died soon

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
after this attack we finally figured out

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.510 
after this attack we finally figured out
