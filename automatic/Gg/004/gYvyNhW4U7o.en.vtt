00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
she took some blood work a week ago and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.400 
she took some blood work a week ago and
how<00:00:37.590> did<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.829> let<00:00:38.100> her<00:00:38.840> red<00:00:39.840> blood<00:00:39.870> cells

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
how did that let her red blood cells

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.319 
how did that let her red blood cells
were<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.309> too<00:00:41.489> large<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
were just a little bit too large and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.450 
were just a little bit too large and
when<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.960> happens<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> need<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:44.070> folic

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
when that happens you need more folic

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.229 
when that happens you need more folic
acid<00:00:44.879> also<00:00:45.649> we're<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> continue<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.760> of

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
acid also we're going to continue all of

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
acid also we're going to continue all of
the<00:00:48.770> aspirin<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> heparin<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.579> folic

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
got to induce really really early and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.750 
got to induce really really early and
what's<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.710> what's<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.189> thought<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
what's your what's your thought on that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
what's your what's your thought on that
you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.930> natural<00:01:10.380> as

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you know we want to go as natural as

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
you know we want to go as natural as
possible<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.220> say<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.030> could

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
possible and they say you know you could

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
possible and they say you know you could
have<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> chance<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> losing<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> baby<00:01:13.860> really

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
have a chance of losing the baby really

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.620 
have a chance of losing the baby really
early<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> guess<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.090> been<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.330> both<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
early and I guess that's been on both of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.499 
early and I guess that's been on both of
our<00:01:15.720> hearts<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.680> situation<00:01:17.509> not

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
our hearts with this situation not

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.030 
our hearts with this situation not
treated<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.900> increase<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.170> incidence<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
treated it can increase the incidence of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
treated it can increase the incidence of
still<00:01:23.280> boards<00:01:23.580> even<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.689> due

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
still boards even right up to your due

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
still boards even right up to your due
date<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:26.070> why<00:01:26.280> we're<00:01:26.520> seeing<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.030> as

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
date so that's why we're seeing you as

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
date so that's why we're seeing you as
often<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.110> are<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.829> still<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
often as we are now we're still going to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.420 
often as we are now we're still going to
be<00:01:29.400> measuring<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> cord<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.009> with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> cord

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
be measuring the cord and with the cord

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.520 
be measuring the cord and with the cord
we<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> velocity<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.259> blood

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
we can see the velocity of the blood

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.840 
we can see the velocity of the blood
going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:37.290> baby<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.920> coming<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:38.640> from

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
going to your baby and coming back from

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
going to your baby and coming back from
the<00:01:39.030> placenta<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.869> sure<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> placenta

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the placenta make sure that the placenta

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.700 
the placenta make sure that the placenta
is<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.159> starting<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> clawed<00:01:42.119> off<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:43.350> dr.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is not starting to clawed off when dr.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.800 
is not starting to clawed off when dr.
Rick<00:01:43.890> talked<00:01:44.189> about<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> risk<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.270> stillbirth

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
Rick talked about the risk of stillbirth

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
Rick talked about the risk of stillbirth
you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.490> hearing<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.820> word

this usually we particularly with
treatment<00:02:07.200> doesn't<00:02:07.439> come<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.690> just

you<00:02:11.319> have<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.819> checking<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
you have but that and checking the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.660 
you have but that and checking the
movement<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:13.780> if<00:02:13.870> things<00:02:14.110> look<00:02:14.409> like<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
movement and if things look like the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.059 
movement and if things look like the
baby<00:02:15.909> would<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.180> better<00:02:16.450> out<00:02:16.599> than<00:02:17.079> in<00:02:17.260> yeah

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
baby would be better out than in yeah

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.399 
baby would be better out than in yeah
then<00:02:18.430> we'll<00:02:18.579> go<00:02:18.700> with<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.879> I<00:02:19.299> think<00:02:20.049> we<00:02:20.230> both

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
then we'll go with that I think we both

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.259 
then we'll go with that I think we both
know<00:02:20.620> there's<00:02:21.040> risk<00:02:21.579> involved<00:02:21.939> with<00:02:22.180> this

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
know there's risk involved with this

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.210 
know there's risk involved with this
pregnancy<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.049> at<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> same<00:02:23.439> time<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:24.129> know

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
pregnancy but at the same time you know

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.740 
pregnancy but at the same time you know
I<00:02:24.489> would<00:02:24.640> go<00:02:24.790> through<00:02:25.000> all<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.540> more

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
I would go through all this and more

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.930 
I would go through all this and more
just<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.099> know<00:02:27.129> be<00:02:27.370> at<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.549> point<00:02:27.760> where

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
just to you know be at the point where

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.899 
just to you know be at the point where
we<00:02:28.060> are<00:02:28.180> now<00:02:28.769> just<00:02:29.769> imagine<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.459> I'm<00:02:30.730> going

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
we are now just imagine that I'm going

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.890 
we are now just imagine that I'm going
to<00:02:30.970> bring<00:02:31.060> another<00:02:31.269> life<00:02:31.510> into<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.840> world

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
to bring another life into this world

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.980 
to bring another life into this world
