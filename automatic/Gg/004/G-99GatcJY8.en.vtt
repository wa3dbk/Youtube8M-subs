out<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.930> stream<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.560> energy<00:04:31.710> from<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.220> bit

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
out a stream of energy from that bit

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.210 
out a stream of energy from that bit
there<00:04:32.880> at<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.090> top<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.690> red<00:04:33.870> part<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.160> she

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
there at the top the red part so she

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.200 
there at the top the red part so she
could<00:04:35.400> lash<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.030> grab<00:04:36.780> things<00:04:37.110> with<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:38.210> but
