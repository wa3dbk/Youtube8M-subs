 this super 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.380
 my arrival in the usa 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.429
 in the hills 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429
 this school path july one petanque a year before 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.029
 according to this same poll 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.140
 according to samuel azé 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.090
 we will see how we could go this day 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.080
 the scenario is very deep 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.070
 and then they win at the park 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.930
 they are c 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.710
 goodbye had the opportunity to score 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 what is supported by saïd 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 this great player 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 that Sens 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.560
 left 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.850
 after the effort 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 she has not disappeared 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.510
 Zinedine Zidane 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 this source 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.870
 the school project 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.870
 I am proud in bed 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.750
 solesmes 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.440
 never in progress 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.590
 but everyone was talking about it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.620
 I think I'm struggling with the attacks of school 60 rooms 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 we look at the information 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.100

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 it would be stupid 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.960
 that of the cucs 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.550
 but this effort 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.550
 his song explains the time 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.440
 deep regrets 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 next week 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.910
 ap 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.100

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.230
 in terms of venues for each match 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.240
 if all goes well 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.509
 the structures 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.889
 we are improving ourselves 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.109
