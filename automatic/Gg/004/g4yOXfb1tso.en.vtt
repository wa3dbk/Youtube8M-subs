00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
get too much water in there and then you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.250 
get too much water in there and then you
just<00:01:45.930> basically<00:01:46.830> stir<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> around<00:01:48.260> the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
just basically stir it around the
