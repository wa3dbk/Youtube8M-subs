ar-15 pistol this thing is so badass oh

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250 
ar-15 pistol this thing is so badass oh
it's<00:02:15.160> tactical<00:02:15.940> armament<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.840> thing<00:02:17.050> just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
it's tactical armament this thing just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.110

everywhere<00:02:18.070> it's<00:02:18.220> awesome<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> biggest<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
everywhere it's awesome the biggest and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.680 
everywhere it's awesome the biggest and
first<00:02:19.390> obvious<00:02:20.020> thing<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.290> notice<00:02:20.620> it's

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
first obvious thing you notice it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.510 
first obvious thing you notice it's
shooting<00:02:22.690> full<00:02:22.900> auto<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.350> right<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.040> this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
shooting full auto there right so this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.940 
shooting full auto there right so this
actually<00:02:25.000> has<00:02:25.180> three<00:02:25.540> modes<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:26.200> got<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.680> safe

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
actually has three modes it's got a safe

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.580 
actually has three modes it's got a safe
mode<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.490> semi-auto<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.630> what<00:02:28.990> they<00:02:29.140> call<00:02:29.380> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
mode a semi-auto and what they call a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.050 
mode a semi-auto and what they call a
rapid-fire<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.520> trigger<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:30.940> you're

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
rapid-fire in the trigger and if you're

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.640 
rapid-fire in the trigger and if you're
curious<00:02:31.210> on<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.870> how<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.260> works<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
curious on the on how that works and the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.750 
curious on the on how that works and the
specs<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.100> trigger<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:33.460> have<00:02:33.550> another

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
specs of that trigger we have another

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.990 
specs of that trigger we have another
video<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.540> check<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:36.000> what

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
video so you can check that out but what

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.120 
video so you can check that out but what
this<00:02:37.150> does<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.590> kind<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.860> gives<00:02:39.070> you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
this does is it it kind of gives you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.160 
this does is it it kind of gives you
that<00:02:39.190> full<00:02:39.520> auto<00:02:39.760> effect<00:02:40.210> without<00:02:40.570> having<00:02:41.110> to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
that full auto effect without having to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.540 
that full auto effect without having to
go<00:02:41.320> through<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.590> tax<00:02:41.800> staff<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.280> everything

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
go through the tax staff and everything

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.250 
go through the tax staff and everything
like<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.730> all<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.420> additional<00:02:43.810> loopholes

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
like that all the additional loopholes

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.140 
like that all the additional loopholes
it's<00:02:44.620> still<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.250> civilian<00:02:45.790> legal<00:02:46.060> for

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
it's still it's it's civilian legal for

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.530 
it's still it's it's civilian legal for
anyone<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.480> own<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.000> blast<00:02:49.270> man

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
anyone to own but it's just a blast man

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.120 
anyone to own but it's just a blast man
and<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.960> biggest<00:02:50.350> thing<00:02:50.530> about<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:50.980> even

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
and the biggest thing about that is even

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.260 
and the biggest thing about that is even
when<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.430> put<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.730> rapid-fire

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
when you put it on that rapid-fire

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.720 
when you put it on that rapid-fire
there's<00:02:52.780> no<00:02:53.020> recoil<00:02:53.410> there's<00:02:53.740> no<00:02:54.040> muzzle<00:02:54.370> jump

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
there's no recoil there's no muzzle jump

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.690 
there's no recoil there's no muzzle jump
this<00:02:55.030> thing<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.780> easy<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.560> use<00:02:56.800> it's<00:02:57.640> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
this thing is so easy to use it's a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.520 
this thing is so easy to use it's a

doubt you get that fireball in that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.790 
doubt you get that fireball in that
first<00:03:13.330> but<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> way<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.260> muzzle<00:03:14.530> brake<00:03:14.680> is

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
first but the way the muzzle brake is

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.710 
first but the way the muzzle brake is
designed<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.520> starts<00:03:15.850> going<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.360> kind<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.630> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
designed it starts going in a kind of a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.870 
designed it starts going in a kind of a
clockwise<00:03:17.110> circle<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:18.370> stop<00:03:18.640> noticing

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
clockwise circle and you stop noticing

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.490 
clockwise circle and you stop noticing
it<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.420> doesn't<00:03:19.660> blind<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.020> whatsoever

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500

it like it doesn't blind you whatsoever
one<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.430> coolest<00:03:21.760> things<00:03:21.970> about<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.360> is

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
one of the coolest things about it is

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.960 
one of the coolest things about it is
this<00:03:22.930> gun<00:03:23.200> has<00:03:23.410> such<00:03:23.709> little<00:03:23.920> recoil<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.670> can

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
this gun has such little recoil you can
