00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.570
 Now how are welcome back I 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.430
 I'm ana diaz and today I did this 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.469
 Fabulous tutorial on how to do this 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.810
 necklace that I think is very nice is 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.760
 as to leave one of those flutes in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.460
 the neck is true is a very collar 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.230
 cute partly very influential the last 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.119
 tutorial that I made of this car a 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.730
 similar necklace in which it appears as 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.009
 cheekpiece and I was also inspired by a 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.780
 tutorial that made a very cool girl that 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:37.180
 it's called line menezes made a necklace 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.950
 cardboard and gave me some ideas to do 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.090
 that this necklace that is very cute 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.740
 to do is very simple and they can do it 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.440
 with super little money and it looks very 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.660
 nice then it gives like this 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.810
 different touch to your little dress 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:57.880
 black or that beautiful strapless dress 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.900
 what you want then we are going to 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.490
 start 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.530
 we are going to need a box matches something 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.650
 to measure a ruler or a tape measure 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.710
 for a thick needle 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:18.700
 transparent strawberries of preference 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 Scissors sticks this type of thread 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.410
 that we continue with those of tin and pancakes 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 Hexagonal gold and paint 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.220
 spray in golden color 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.890
 The first thing to do is measure 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.670
 the boats and start cutting we're going to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 need 10 small boats and then the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 other measures we will occupy a couple of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.850
 each one except the middle one that is the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.500
 the longest is the one of nothing else we occupy 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.500
 then good one starts to cut 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.259
 do not 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.000
 and keep cutting until they have ready 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.409
 all the sticks 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.289
 then let's grab the thick needle 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.030
 and we are going to do a roll right in the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.820
 top part do not do it too much 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.860
 up because the edge breaks up like this 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.540
 a little eye and then go over the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.540
 cielito with a stick 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.680
 and well let's repeat this 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.079
 procedure with all the sticks 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.390
 and just when they're ready they put them in 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:30.170
 the chopsticks of the box that I already had 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.859
 list and that's when rossi in the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.000
 paint medium golden color and when 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:39.290
 you are good what you dry 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 they have to grab and match and burn a 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.260
 side of the rat tail and crush it 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.940
 very well with the scissors and the most 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.940
 You can here stay strong 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.870
 it was a bit slow because it can go into 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.860
 the floor because they cut people stay 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.860
 as a habit 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.290
 so they continue cutting until it is like 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.569
 affiliate and already have their rat tail 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.569
 liza then accommodate everything by size 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.189
 and then they are accommodating one by one they are going to 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.930
 have to use the toothpick again to 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.939
 open the milestones because then it covers 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.240
 figure and then use the little string and 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:34.980
 begin to accommodate 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.980
 and it's a long process 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.890
 until they finally have all the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.670
 sticks in order they run towards the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.670
 middle of the necklace 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.620
 and that's when the pancakes are 3 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.150
 on each side is what will give you weight 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.400
 to the collar so it does not come back because 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.270
 Well, it's a nice test, it has to look like 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.190
 it weighs at least a little 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.030
 and once you are ready pancakes 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.030
 they make him a new 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.229
 and the other side is exactly the same 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.370
 thing they put the wipes do a knot and 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.370
 your necklace is ready 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.349
 and well this was all for today I hope that 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.080
 you liked it and well we see the 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.649
 next can check the blog for 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.149
 check all the measurements of this necklace 

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.409
 because if you need several measures and 

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.979
 good 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.979
 bye
