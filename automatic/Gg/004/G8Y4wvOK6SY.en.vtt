00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
we'll see um my second drain has been

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
we'll see um my second drain has been
drained<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.450> 40<00:01:21.960> every<00:01:22.799> day<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
drained in about 40 every day and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730

yesterday<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> 55<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.500> today

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
yesterday was actually a 55 but today

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740 
yesterday was actually a 55 but today
it's<00:01:25.920> less<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.280> 20<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it's less than 20 so I really think I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's less than 20 so I really think I
make<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> rid<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.619> tomorrow<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759

deep breath I like that just to kind of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.670

hold<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.720> place<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.140> doesn't<00:02:23.230> stretch

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
hold it in place so it doesn't stretch

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.110 
hold it in place so it doesn't stretch

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.240 
it just feels like I'm pulling a burning
I<00:02:28.300> don't<00:02:28.540> know<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.950> only

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
I don't know it just that's the only

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.620 
I don't know it just that's the only
place<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.790> really<00:02:31.030> feel<00:02:31.330> something

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630

and I guess that had like go to so maybe

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.670 
and I guess that had like go to so maybe
it's<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> double<00:02:37.840> whammy<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.500> why

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
it's a double whammy and that's why

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.200

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
it's wrong the binder being so tight and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.870 
it's wrong the binder being so tight and
if<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.720> feels<00:04:47.990> like<00:04:48.350> when<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.070> eat<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.430> there's

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
if it feels like when I eat that there's

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.640 
if it feels like when I eat that there's
somebody<00:04:50.180> squeezing<00:04:50.780> my<00:04:50.900> waist<00:04:51.140> like<00:04:51.380> this

somebody squeezing my waist like this

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.490 
somebody squeezing my waist like this
and<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.850> just<00:04:53.060> feels<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.540> tight<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.110> can't

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.150 
I don't really I would enjoy a little
more<00:05:28.220> restriction<00:05:28.670> sometimes<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.890> my<00:05:30.890> feet

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
more restriction sometimes so my feet

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.940 
more restriction sometimes so my feet

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
are normally terribly swollen I took

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.710

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
pictures this morning because my feet

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.100 
pictures this morning because my feet
are<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:36.050> thin<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.440> think<00:05:36.710> this<00:05:36.800> is<00:05:36.890> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
are so thin I think this is the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.750 
are so thin I think this is the
I've<00:05:37.470> ever<00:05:37.650> seen<00:05:37.830> them<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:38.310> I<00:05:38.490> can<00:05:38.640> only

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.400 
I've ever seen them and I can only
assume<00:05:38.940> it's<00:05:39.240> from<00:05:39.360> having<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.690> mop<00:05:39.840> console

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410
