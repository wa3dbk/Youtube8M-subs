think the presentation the way it was

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.339 
think the presentation the way it was
told<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.790> slow<00:00:09.120> pace<00:00:09.360> because<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.960> felt

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
told in a very slow pace because I felt

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.230 
told in a very slow pace because I felt
as<00:00:10.469> though<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.769> backstory<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.580> week<00:00:11.820> we're

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
slowed down the pace a little bit

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.870 
slowed down the pace a little bit
because<00:00:16.289> everything<00:00:16.949> has<00:00:17.070> been<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.580> fast

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
if like he was just some quiet asshole

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.680 
if like he was just some quiet asshole
but<00:03:01.560> his<00:03:01.950> character<00:03:02.849> makes<00:03:03.209> sense<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
but his character makes sense the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.030 
but his character makes sense the
characterization<00:03:04.410> we've<00:03:04.500> gotten<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.919> him

characterization we've gotten of him

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.909 
characterization we've gotten of him
thus<00:03:05.430> far<00:03:05.730> all<00:03:05.760> adds<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.930> mean<00:03:07.109> looked<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.769> as

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
thus far all adds up I mean looked at as

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.129 
thus far all adds up I mean looked at as
a<00:03:07.950> monster<00:03:08.489> went<00:03:08.910> through<00:03:09.090> crazy<00:03:09.510> experiments

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
a monster went through crazy experiments

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.080 
a monster went through crazy experiments
as<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> kid<00:03:10.590> had<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.099> girlfriend<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.790> then<00:03:11.910> she

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
as a kid had a girlfriend and then she

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.909 
as a kid had a girlfriend and then she
ends<00:03:12.209> up<00:03:12.329> cheating<00:03:12.599> on<00:03:12.840> him<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.169> having<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.680> kid

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
ends up cheating on him and having a kid

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.979 
ends up cheating on him and having a kid
that's<00:03:14.069> not<00:03:14.250> even<00:03:14.459> his<00:03:14.609> yeah<00:03:15.239> everything<00:03:15.840> all

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
that's not even his yeah everything all

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.170 
that's not even his yeah everything all
adds<00:03:16.259> up<00:03:16.470> as<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.829> why<00:03:16.979> eight<00:03:17.250> off<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.609> who<00:03:17.790> he<00:03:17.970> is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
adds up as to why eight off is who he is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.120 
adds up as to why eight off is who he is
but<00:03:18.509> at<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.690> same<00:03:18.810> time<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.079> guess<00:03:19.350> maybe<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
but at the same time I guess maybe the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.940 
but at the same time I guess maybe the
tragedy<00:03:20.760> adds<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.690> ferocity<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.500> him<00:03:22.710> because

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
tragedy adds the ferocity of him because

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.040 
tragedy adds the ferocity of him because
I<00:03:23.010> mean<00:03:23.190> 300<00:03:23.910> fucking<00:03:24.270> roaches<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.810> he's<00:03:24.900> like

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
I mean 300 fucking roaches and he's like

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.470 
I mean 300 fucking roaches and he's like
I<00:03:25.200> handled<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.010> yeah<00:03:26.940> most<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.300> this

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
I handled that like yeah most of this

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.150 
I handled that like yeah most of this
episode<00:03:27.840> was<00:03:27.990> definitely<00:03:28.380> dedicated<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.040> him

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
episode was definitely dedicated to him

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.950 
episode was definitely dedicated to him
and<00:03:29.280> again<00:03:29.820> was<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.240> gift<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.630> curse<00:03:30.780> for

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
and again was a gift and a curse for

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.940 
and again was a gift and a curse for
terraform<00:03:31.320> Mars<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.650> feels<00:03:31.770> as<00:03:31.920> though

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
terraform Mars and feels as though

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.130 
terraform Mars and feels as though
almost<00:03:32.610> every<00:03:32.970> week<00:03:33.120> we're<00:03:33.300> like<00:03:33.450> focusing<00:03:33.960> on

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
almost every week we're like focusing on

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.960 
almost every week we're like focusing on
one<00:03:34.710> or<00:03:34.860> two<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.250> three<00:03:35.280> different<00:03:35.850> characters

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
one or two or three different characters

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.700 
one or two or three different characters
and<00:03:36.330> getting<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> backstory<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.080> think<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.590> way

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
and getting a backstory I think the way

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.650 
and getting a backstory I think the way
they<00:03:37.860> did<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.100> with<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.370> episode<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:39.090> felt<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
they did it with this episode it felt a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
they did it with this episode it felt a
lot<00:03:39.750> better<00:03:39.900> than<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.200> rest<00:03:40.380> because<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
lot better than the rest because it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.920 
lot better than the rest because it
really<00:03:41.190> solely<00:03:41.460> focused<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.090> Adolph<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.750> it's

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
really solely focused on Adolph and it's

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.570 
really solely focused on Adolph and it's
like<00:03:43.020> okay<00:03:43.620> Michele<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.130> my<00:03:44.250> favorite

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
like okay Michele is my favorite

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.280 
like okay Michele is my favorite
character<00:03:44.700> thus<00:03:45.150> far<00:03:45.390> but<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.080> way<00:03:46.170> they

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
character thus far but the way they

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.500 
character thus far but the way they
presented<00:03:46.500> ate<00:03:47.010> off<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.940> he<00:03:48.060> could<00:03:48.240> be<00:03:48.270> up

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
presented ate off I think he could be up

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.270 
presented ate off I think he could be up
there<00:03:48.660> as<00:03:48.810> well<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.020> think<00:03:49.110> it'll<00:03:49.410> be<00:03:49.590> Michelle

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
there as well I think it'll be Michelle

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.740 
there as well I think it'll be Michelle
and<00:03:50.490> Adolph<00:03:50.850> for<00:03:51.000> my<00:03:51.090> two<00:03:51.150> favorites<00:03:51.630> because

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
and Adolph for my two favorites because

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.600 
and Adolph for my two favorites because
they<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.530> really<00:03:52.860> took<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> time<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.520> this

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
they just really took the time with this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.690 
they just really took the time with this
episode<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.510> showcase<00:03:54.960> who<00:03:55.200> he<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.770> why<00:03:56.310> he

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
episode to showcase who he is and why he

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.850 
episode to showcase who he is and why he
is<00:03:56.940> ultimately<00:03:57.690> an<00:03:57.900> asshole<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.560> don't<00:03:58.590> blame
