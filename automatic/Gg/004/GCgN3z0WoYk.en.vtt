I'm going to run a full benchmark on

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
I'm going to run a full benchmark on
both<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> results<00:00:30.300> are<00:00:30.359> like

and<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:31.500> also<00:00:31.650> run<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> browser<00:00:32.279> test

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and then I will also run a browser test

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.930 
and then I will also run a browser test
and<00:00:32.969> see<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:33.570> stock<00:00:34.200> browser<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.800> better<00:00:34.980> so

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to compare both devices so let me get

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.990 
to compare both devices so let me get
closer<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.450> zoom<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.520> show

you the results better here so you can
see<00:01:02.940> both<00:01:03.539> run<00:01:04.199> two<00:01:04.409> calls<00:01:04.739> both<00:01:05.040> run<00:01:05.309> at

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
see both run two calls both run at

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.850 
see both run two calls both run at
maximum<00:01:06.060> 1.2<00:01:06.600> gigahertz<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
maximum 1.2 gigahertz and here are the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.249 
maximum 1.2 gigahertz and here are the
scores<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:13.610> lot<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> scores

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
do I will run the browser test which is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
do I will run the browser test which is
an<00:01:34.530> app<00:01:34.680> called<00:01:35.009> vellum<00:01:35.700> 0<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.360> runs

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
an app called vellum 0 which runs

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
an app called vellum 0 which runs
SunSpider<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.530> well<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.070> other<00:01:38.670> room<00:01:39.950> tests<00:01:40.950> so

is a quick comparison and a thought to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.330 
is a quick comparison and a thought to
give<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> demonstration<00:02:17.379> of<00:02:17.980> powder

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
give you a demonstration of powder

give you a demonstration of powder
brazzers<00:02:18.760> perform<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:20.109> I'm<00:02:20.409> going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.799> a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
brazzers perform but I'm going to do a

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.099 
brazzers perform but I'm going to do a
real-world<00:02:21.159> test<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.180> i<00:02:22.389> will<00:02:22.540> load<00:02:22.719> a<00:02:22.749> page

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
real-world test and i will load a page

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.089 
real-world test and i will load a page
up<00:02:23.379> right<00:02:23.620> now<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:25.870> which<00:02:26.170> device<00:02:26.560> loaded

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
up right now and see which device loaded

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.229 
up right now and see which device loaded
up<00:02:27.219> quick<00:02:27.489> up<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:30.340> i'm<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.939> to<00:02:31.000> test

quickly same here it seems I think much

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.759 
quickly same here it seems I think much
more<00:03:55.599> intuitive<00:03:56.379> much<00:03:56.859> more<00:03:57.099> responsive<00:03:58.769> some

zooms in does the little tap now that

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.160 
zooms in does the little tap now that
I'm<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.100> look<00:04:10.340> at<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:10.940> screen<00:04:11.300> resolution<00:04:11.960> and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
I'm a look at the screen resolution and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.430 
I'm a look at the screen resolution and
how<00:04:12.470> well<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:14.390> performs<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.050> will<00:04:15.140> try<00:04:15.380> and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
how well it performs it will try and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.260 
how well it performs it will try and
zoom<00:04:15.680> into<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.040> same<00:04:16.600> same<00:04:17.600> part<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.820> see<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
zoom into the same same part and see the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.150 
zoom into the same same part and see the
closest<00:04:20.870> i<00:04:21.020> can<00:04:21.080> zoom<00:04:21.290> into<00:04:23.560> sort<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.860> like

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
closest i can zoom into sort of like

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.510 
closest i can zoom into sort of like
this<00:04:28.480> yeah<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.620> there<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:31.070> don't<00:04:31.370> know<00:04:31.460> if

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
this yeah so there I don't know if

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.980 
this yeah so there I don't know if
that's<00:04:31.730> visible<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.480> think<00:04:32.720> you'll<00:04:32.840> be<00:04:32.960> very

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
that's visible I think you'll be very

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.370 
that's visible I think you'll be very
very<00:04:33.320> difficult<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:34.250> see<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.380> screen

very difficult to see the screen

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.710 
very difficult to see the screen
resolution<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.190> can<00:04:37.250> see<00:04:37.610> slight<00:04:38.030> exhalation

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
resolution you can see slight exhalation

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.600 
resolution you can see slight exhalation
