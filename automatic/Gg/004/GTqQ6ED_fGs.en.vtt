00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 is happening all over the country a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.900
 large demonstration against corruption 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.219
 the Peruvian fifth, the great manifesto also 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 one of the main demands will be the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.289
 price of air tickets may or may not be 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689
 not being downloaded for this I go 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.570
 talk to the owner of the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.289
 Saint Lucia has to lower the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.199
 Canavarro Contijo ticket price 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.590
 Bonetti is a very difficult thing I 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.570
 I stayed two years without raising the rate 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 and the rate was increased in May 2012 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.469
 It was already my thinking, we would not ask. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.360
 increase this year 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.680

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.239
 2013 year 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.050
 I'm not going to make a claim 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.239
 none really rate but download 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.109
 I find it very difficult for the student 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.629
 not least because the student already paid us 65 it 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.290
 has a discount of 25 percent and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.299
 majority of students receive 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.680
 for free through the city hall 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.780

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 these portfolios are claimed are 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.600
 by iff the secretary of education 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.200
 The secretary of education sends me a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.110
 list and sound fabricate the enterprise 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.689

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.299

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.610

 the passage to the students 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 Canavaro a question you against this 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.979

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.470
 I am totally in favor as a citizen 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.990
 Brazilian, I also feel the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 effects of this corruption on the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.009
 taxes we pay from this 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.829
 amount of money that the government 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.619
 is spending with these stadiums are 28 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.009
 billions of reais that could be 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.920
 is directed to the people for the construction of 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.869
 homes improvement schools hospitals 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 the people going hungry we see the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.740
 hospitals falling into pieces people in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 hallways in hands 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.390
 the government does not have the money to solve 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.670
 The problem is to build stadiums 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 the Pharaonic works always give a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.050
 So I'm totally in favor. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.270
 I'm Brazilian citizen, I feel on my skin. 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.640
 you also realize that health also 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.710

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.230
 with this water of health 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.850

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.120
 of the country 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.520
 It's shameful, we all know that. 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.800
 this kind of television 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.140
 that's what goes on in the country 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.260
 but the Kanawa itaperunian people also 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.480

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.480
