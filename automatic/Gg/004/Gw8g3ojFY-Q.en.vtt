00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.520
 Y 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.389
 i 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.789
 hello youtube friends how am i 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.259
 man 3000 and this is curiosities of 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.060
 donkey kong 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.400
 in my opinion donkey kong is one of the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.269
 best game franchises good 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.890
 No. 1 begin knew what tranqui 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.360
 code is the original donkey kong that 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.910
 appeared on arcade machines 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.920
 throwing barrels at mario and that the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.710
 donkey kong of the super nintendo is the one 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.090
 before it was donkey kong juniors in fact 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.820
 even the franchise has 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.829
 confirmed in the intro of donkey kong 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.200
 country there is a curious wink to this data 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.180
 in the intro you can see tranqui 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.670
 playing the original donkey song 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.410
 kong for the arcade and you can also 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.570
 see crans and on a very surface 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.550
 similar to the first game of donkey 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.350
 Kong is also seen throwing from a 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 barrel to donkey kong from now doing 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.670
 reference to the original game 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.420
 apart from what has already been mentioned in the donkey 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.460
 kong country for game boy advance to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.530
 talk to frank and many times he tells us 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.130
 that retro games were better than 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.290
 the barrels weighed more and between things 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.570
 number 2 universal sued nintendo 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.580
 the resemblance that had the name 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.590
 key with the protagonist of the movie 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.770
 king kong but they won the demand those of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.630
 nintendo the legal adviser called john 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.270
 Kirby helped Nintendo win the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.200
 judgment because of this it is said that for that 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.240
 reason kirk o'bee is so called number 3 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.360
 donkey kong country 2 and it will appear in 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.430
 the virtual boy that's how they hear it 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.730
 one of the best games of the super 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.650
 nintendo was going to be in the virtual boy 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.690
 the game was just beginning to 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.790
 development but was canceled due to 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.030
 the sales so low that the virtual 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.150
 boy, imagine what the game would be like if 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.340
 I would have left for the virtual boy 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.320
 first let's look at the bad if this game 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 would have been released for the virtual boy 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.790
 It would be entirely in red and black which 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.350
 it would be a bit annoying since the virtual 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.990
 boy only has the ability 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.570
 of emitting those two colors would also be 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.910
 annoying to play it every 15 minutes since 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.180
 as you will know if you play it more than 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.580
 15 minutes will give headache now 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.350
 let's look at the good if it had gone to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.870
 to have left is true that it would be annoying 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.120
 see everything in red and black however in 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.800
 several levels this would be great since 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.050
 it would cause a sinister look and 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.600
 mysterious as would be the case of the level 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.000
 of the castle of the final boss that in my 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.550
 opinion would cause much more emotion to see it 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.830
 in red and black I would also have 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.020
 amazing 3d effects and playability 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.030
 ignores how to move from a close-up to 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.670
 a background as seen in guardiola 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.740
 Cndh imagine moving from a barrel of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.510
 close up to a background and notice 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.370
 the depth as great as in 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.170
 guardiola cndh or that with gold is 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.020
 when you can throw coconuts towards the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 camera but definitely the best 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.570
 would be the end in third dimension 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.970
 it would be a great game but as I said it is not 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.310
 could play more than 15 minutes in a row 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.350
 it would not be good to play in the virtual 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.720
 gogh and this game well as you will know the 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.600
 3d effect for the virtual boy is harmful 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.340
 for the human eye in my opinion it would be 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.340
 great to be taken out for the nintendo 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.770
 3ds since this console despite having 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.080
 a 3d effect without glasses its effect is not 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.140
 harmful to the eyes nor does it cause 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.960
 as dizzy as the virtual boy does 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.640
 number 4 in donkey kong 3 you can see 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.160
 that the old lady is playing a 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.190
 game because they believe it or not is 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.840
 playing the super Mario 64 can you 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.750
 appreciate that you are playing with a 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.640
 nintendo 64 you also hear the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.730
 song of the castle of the princess 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.300
 peach 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.300
 here 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.600
 number 5 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.850
 previously the game of donkey kong 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.310
 arcade was going to have different characters 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.620
 which were going to be popeye brutes and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.390
 Olive Nintendo could not get the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.280
 license of these characters 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.380
 then shigeru miyamoto looked 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.250
 forced to create new characters for 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.420
 this game but with the same gameplay 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.140
 They replaced Brutus by Donkey Kong 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.520
 olive pauline and abutted and Mario 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.200
 number 6 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.660
 donkey kong at the beginning he was going to call 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.310
 monkey com however for an error of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.270
 translation was called donkey kong in 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.550
 america number 7 in donkey kong 2 los 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.580
 pinches monkeys do not know how to add or divide 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 xd just look at the blackboard on the left 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.009
 and you'll see what I'm talking about 9 divided into 3 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.129
 6 8 for 19 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.080
 and to finish number 8 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.089
 at the end of donkey kong country 2 it 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.039
 You can appreciate how many coins you have and 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.889
 what nintendo characters did you win 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.680
 getting coins the characters are 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.960
 queen mario and I do, but that's not what 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.899
 curious the funny thing is the dump 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.539
 they say eye bears that means they do not have 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.580
 Hope is curious since next 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.729
 dumpster appear sonic boots and 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.680
 the tree plasma gun game like 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.479
 you'll know at the time of the nineties and that 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.759
 the video game companies were given 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.830
 hard on commercials and insults by 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.919
 so to say it in a subjective way as is 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.479
 the case of this curiosity x of good and 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.479
 that's all youtube friends 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.430
 i
