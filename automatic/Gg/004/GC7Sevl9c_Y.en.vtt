number 28 and by looking at some of

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.899 
number 28 and by looking at some of
these<00:00:45.650> it's<00:00:45.949> hard<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.250> tell<00:00:46.430> like<00:00:46.699> when<00:00:46.820> you

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
these it's hard to tell like when you

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.340 
these it's hard to tell like when you
look<00:00:47.059> at<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:47.360> one<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:47.780> hard<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:47.989> tell<00:00:48.170> what

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
look at this one it's hard to tell what

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.399 
look at this one it's hard to tell what
it<00:00:48.470> is<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:49.760> will<00:00:49.820> even<00:00:50.059> look<00:00:50.210> cool<00:00:50.510> but<00:00:50.930> it

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
it is that it will even look cool but it

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:52.689 
it is that it will even look cool but it
actually<00:00:51.739> turns<00:00:51.920> out<00:00:52.070> pretty<00:00:52.309> good<00:00:52.519> I<00:00:52.549> think

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
actually turns out pretty good I think

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.469 
actually turns out pretty good I think
and<00:00:53.449> then<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.140> select<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.650> and<00:00:55.120> then<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.299> can

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
and then you select it and then you can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.689 
and then you select it and then you can
page<00:00:56.720> through<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.559> it'll<00:00:58.309> show<00:00:58.339> you<00:00:58.519> the

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
and that you need to thread the machine

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.820 
and that you need to thread the machine
with<00:01:04.430> on<00:01:04.640> each<00:01:04.820> step<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:06.470> just<00:01:06.650> click

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
magenta and there's a moss queen as well

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.099 
magenta and there's a moss queen as well
coming<00:01:24.259> up<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:24.799> I'm<00:01:25.460> not<00:01:25.789> a<00:01:25.820> big<00:01:26.030> fan<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.539> like

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
coming up that I'm not a big fan of like

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.139 
coming up that I'm not a big fan of like
the<00:01:27.229> white<00:01:27.380> ghost<00:01:27.649> though<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.310> pretty<00:01:28.520> cool

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.639 

so<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.450> color<00:01:32.689> that's<00:01:32.929> on<00:01:33.079> there<00:01:33.259> it's<00:01:33.380> just

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
so the color that's on there it's just

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.230 
so the color that's on there it's just
telling<00:01:33.859> you<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.039> color<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.460> grab<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.119> can

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
telling you a color to grab so you can

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.580 
telling you a color to grab so you can
replace<00:01:35.539> it<00:01:35.600> with<00:01:35.840> any<00:01:35.990> color<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.469> want

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
replace it with any color that you want

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.800

so<00:01:56.240> keep<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.690> mind<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.320> then<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:58.040> can

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
so keep that in mind and then you can

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.650 
so keep that in mind and then you can
also<00:01:58.280> change<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.730> layout<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.060> can<00:01:59.390> move<00:01:59.540> it

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
also change the layout you can move it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.510 
also change the layout you can move it
around<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:00.200> then<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.800> can<00:02:00.920> change<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.220> size

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
around and then you can change the size

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.770 
around and then you can change the size
as<00:02:01.760> well<00:02:01.940> but<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.240> wouldn't<00:02:02.600> recommend

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
as well but I wouldn't recommend

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.570 
as well but I wouldn't recommend
changing<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.470> size<00:02:03.710> too<00:02:04.010> much<00:02:04.160> because<00:02:04.400> I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
changing the size too much because I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.880 
changing the size too much because I
don't<00:02:04.760> know<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> thread-count<00:02:05.890> resizes

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
don't know that the thread-count resizes

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.749 
don't know that the thread-count resizes
with<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:09.229> basically<00:02:10.009> I'm<00:02:10.460> just<00:02:10.610> going<00:02:10.729> to

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
with it so basically I'm just going to

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.360 
with it so basically I'm just going to
get<00:02:10.910> started<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.110> our<00:02:12.320> first<00:02:12.680> step<00:02:13.040> which

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
get started this is our first step which

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.050 
get started this is our first step which
is<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.910> orange<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.490> can<00:02:16.610> see<00:02:16.760> I've<00:02:16.880> got

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
is the orange and you can see I've got

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.490 
is the orange and you can see I've got
it<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.330> orange<00:02:17.660> material<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.350> going<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
it on orange material so it's going to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.570 
it on orange material so it's going to
be<00:02:18.650> kind<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.130> hard<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.490> see<00:02:19.700> here<00:02:20.260> as<00:02:21.580> we're

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
be kind of hard to see here as we're

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.370 
be kind of hard to see here as we're
going<00:02:22.790> along<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.360> what<00:02:23.780> I'll<00:02:23.900> end<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:24.170> doing

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
going along and what I'll end up doing

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.000 
going along and what I'll end up doing
too<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.720> fast-forwarding<00:02:26.720> I'll<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.710> get<00:02:27.890> it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
too is fast-forwarding I'll just get it

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
too is fast-forwarding I'll just get it
the<00:02:28.040> stitch<00:02:28.460> started<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.630> then<00:02:29.750> I'll

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
the stitch started and then I'll

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.810 
the stitch started and then I'll
fast-forward<00:02:30.200> through<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.740> rest<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.730> I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
fast-forward through the rest and I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.130 
fast-forward through the rest and I
won't<00:02:32.030> even<00:02:32.180> show<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.540> part<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.960> always

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
won't even show this part but I always

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.570 
won't even show this part but I always
like<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.320> cut<00:02:33.590> my<00:02:33.709> tail<00:02:33.950> off<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.490> beginning

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
like to cut my tail off in the beginning

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.620 
like to cut my tail off in the beginning
once<00:02:35.030> I've<00:02:35.180> got<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> few<00:02:35.690> base<00:02:36.410> stitches<00:02:36.950> in

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
once I've got a few base stitches in

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.760 
once I've got a few base stitches in
just<00:02:38.630> enough<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.050> doesn't<00:02:39.110> pull<00:02:39.470> out<00:02:39.620> if

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
just enough so it doesn't pull out if

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.880 
just enough so it doesn't pull out if
you<00:02:39.860> cut<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.620> less<00:02:42.770> to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
you cut it and then a it's just less to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.490 
you cut it and then a it's just less to
deal<00:02:43.040> with<00:02:43.220> later<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.880> my<00:02:44.000> opinion<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:45.320> I'll

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
deal with later in my opinion but I'll

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.250 
deal with later in my opinion but I'll
fast<00:02:46.100> forward<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:47.990> I'll<00:02:48.110> go

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
fast forward this and then I'll go

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.750 
fast forward this and then I'll go
through<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.650> next<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> steps<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.580> then

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
through the next of the steps and then

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.310 
through the next of the steps and then
I've<00:02:50.030> also<00:02:50.150> gotten<00:02:50.570> some<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:50.930> exciting

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
I've also gotten some really exciting

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
pretty good it's pretty neat how they

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.580 
pretty good it's pretty neat how they
have<00:04:17.460> it<00:04:17.580> laid<00:04:17.700> out<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:21.120> last<00:04:21.989> stitch<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.320> we

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
have it laid out the last stitch that we

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.580 
have it laid out the last stitch that we
just<00:04:22.620> did<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.130> saw<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.550> there<00:04:23.760> was<00:04:23.910> a

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
just did you saw that there was a

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.750 
just did you saw that there was a
underlay<00:04:25.590> stitch<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.610> even<00:04:26.670> have

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
underlay stitch so you don't even have

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.520 
underlay stitch so you don't even have
to<00:04:27.000> trim<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:27.660> or<00:04:27.840> anything<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:28.500> just

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
to trim that or anything you can just

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.020 
to trim that or anything you can just
stitch<00:04:28.890> right<00:04:28.920> over<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.490> now<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.700> jump

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
stitch right over it now the jump

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.030 
stitch right over it now the jump
stitches<00:04:30.390> you're<00:04:30.540> going<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.750> want<00:04:30.900> to

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
stitches you're going to want to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.350 
stitches you're going to want to
probably<00:04:32.040> trim<00:04:32.370> up<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.760> little<00:04:33.030> bit<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.210> can

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
probably trim up a little bit you can

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.960 
probably trim up a little bit you can
see<00:04:33.390> one<00:04:33.720> right<00:04:34.380> here<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.800> we<00:04:34.920> just<00:04:34.970> created

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
see one right here that we just created

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.960 
see one right here that we just created
by<00:04:36.690> doing<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.170> which<00:04:37.350> that's<00:04:38.280> fine<00:04:38.640> on<00:04:38.850> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
by doing the which that's fine on the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.450 
by doing the which that's fine on the
broom<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.800> you're<00:04:40.920> going<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.070> want<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.250> clean

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
broom so you're going to want to clean

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.750 
broom so you're going to want to clean
those<00:04:41.610> up<00:04:42.710> or<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.860> can<00:04:43.980> wait<00:04:44.130> till<00:04:44.280> after<00:04:44.430> I

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
those up or you can wait till after I

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.400 
those up or you can wait till after I
think<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.210> little<00:04:45.390> easier<00:04:45.690> as<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:45.900> go<00:04:46.140> you

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
think it's a little easier as you go you

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.720 
think it's a little easier as you go you
got<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.620> change<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.010> thread<00:04:47.280> or<00:04:47.430> whatever

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
got to change the thread or whatever

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.610 
got to change the thread or whatever
anyway<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.690> if<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.930> see<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.140> stitch<00:04:49.440> is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
anyway so and if you see a stitch is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.870 
anyway so and if you see a stitch is
going<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.830> go<00:04:49.980> over<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.490> might<00:04:50.640> want<00:04:50.670> to

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
going to go over it you might want to

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.870 
going to go over it you might want to
stop<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.530> trim<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:53.000> but<00:04:54.260> as<00:04:55.260> far<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.880> this

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
stop it and trim it but as far as this

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.780 
stop it and trim it but as far as this
next<00:04:57.240> color<00:04:57.450> magenta<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.340> it's<00:04:59.580> like<00:04:59.640> a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
next color magenta it's a it's like a

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.850 
next color magenta it's a it's like a
fence<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.750> I'm<00:05:00.930> just<00:05:01.170> making<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:01.830> a

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
fence so I'm just making this like a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.730 
fence so I'm just making this like a
gray<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> silver<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.350> then<00:05:04.560> there's

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
gray like a silver and then there's

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.010 
gray like a silver and then there's
another<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.880> does<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.210> think<00:05:06.420> it's<00:05:06.540> a<00:05:06.780> bat

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
another and it does I think it's a bat

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.270 
another and it does I think it's a bat
as<00:05:07.350> well<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.280> fence<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.760> bad<00:05:09.200> so<00:05:10.200> I'm<00:05:11.070> just

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
as well it's a fence and bad so I'm just

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.650 
as well it's a fence and bad so I'm just
making<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.640> gray<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.000> didn't<00:05:12.390> like<00:05:12.510> the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
making that gray I didn't like the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.440 
making that gray I didn't like the
magenta<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:14.460> make<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.730> whatever<00:05:14.880> color<00:05:15.270> you

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
magenta you make it whatever color you

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.900 
magenta you make it whatever color you
want<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.900> then<00:05:16.200> after<00:05:16.980> the<00:05:17.130> ghost<00:05:17.340> which<00:05:17.760> is

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
want and then after the ghost which is

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.490 
want and then after the ghost which is
next<00:05:18.420> which<00:05:18.690> is<00:05:18.870> white<00:05:19.140> is<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:20.900> other<00:05:21.900> fence

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
next which is white is the other fence

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.400 
next which is white is the other fence
and<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:24.150> just<00:05:24.360> make<00:05:24.510> that<00:05:24.540> one<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.900> same<00:05:25.170> color

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
and I just make that one the same color

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.940 
and I just make that one the same color
so<00:05:25.650> they<00:05:25.770> match<00:05:26.010> they<00:05:26.340> suggest<00:05:26.850> moss<00:05:27.090> green<00:05:27.950> it

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
so they match they suggest moss green it

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.650 
so they match they suggest moss green it
does<00:05:29.160> give<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.520> little<00:05:29.700> pop<00:05:29.970> makes<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.600> a

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
does give it a little pop makes it a

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.920 
does give it a little pop makes it a
little<00:05:30.750> bit<00:05:30.930> more<00:05:31.110> whimsical<00:05:32.540> but<00:05:33.540> I'm<00:05:33.720> just

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
little bit more whimsical but I'm just

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.340 
little bit more whimsical but I'm just
not<00:05:34.170> I'm<00:05:34.770> not<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.980> fan<00:05:35.870> and<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:36.930> can<00:05:37.110> see<00:05:37.260> right

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
not I'm not a fan and you can see right

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.980 
not I'm not a fan and you can see right
there<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.590> was<00:05:37.680> trimming<00:05:37.980> those<00:05:38.600> those<00:05:39.600> jump

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
there I was trimming those those jump

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.890 
there I was trimming those those jump
stitches<00:05:40.380> away<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:42.210> now<00:05:42.390> we're<00:05:42.600> just<00:05:42.630> going<00:05:42.870> to

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
stitches away so now we're just going to

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.510 
stitches away so now we're just going to
finish<00:05:43.170> up<00:05:43.320> on<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.620> ghost<00:05:43.830> this<00:05:44.190> is<00:05:44.370> our

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
finish up on the ghost this is our

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.000 
finish up on the ghost this is our
second<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.090> last<00:05:45.120> step

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
second to last step

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.310 
second to last step
the<00:05:47.760> next<00:05:48.120> step<00:05:48.300> is<00:05:48.510> going<00:05:48.660> to<00:05:48.720> be<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:49.020> fence

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
the next step is going to be the fence

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.180 
the next step is going to be the fence
last<00:05:50.280> part<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.790> fence<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:52.680> like<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:52.980> said

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
last part of the fence and like I said

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.880 
last part of the fence and like I said
before<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.610> just<00:05:53.730> made<00:05:54.450> that<00:05:54.630> gray<00:05:55.080> along<00:05:55.650> with

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
before I just made that gray along with

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.760 
before I just made that gray along with
the<00:05:56.040> other<00:05:56.220> section<00:05:56.700> of<00:05:56.820> fence<00:05:56.970> in<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.300> bat

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
the other section of fence in the bat

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:05.210 
the other section of fence in the bat
and<00:05:59.030> it's<00:06:00.030> a<00:06:00.180> neat<00:06:00.360> design<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:03.860> machine<00:06:04.860> comes

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
and it's a neat design the machine comes

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.370 
and it's a neat design the machine comes
with<00:06:05.340> one<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.480> seems<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:06.960> one<00:06:07.880> little<00:06:09.380> design

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380
