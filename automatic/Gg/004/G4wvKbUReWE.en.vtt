you can get out of the engine without

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.410 
you can get out of the engine without
going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> forced<00:00:29.490> induction<00:00:29.640> such<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.390> a

video<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.360> tune<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.809> fully<00:00:37.110> flexible<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
video is this tune is fully flexible you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
video is this tune is fully flexible you
don't<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> switch<00:00:38.520> maps<00:00:38.820> between<00:00:39.300> two

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
don't have to switch maps between two

don't have to switch maps between two
pm-5<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.410> 98<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.579> mix<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.420> fill

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
pm-5 or 98 you can mix it you can fill

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
pm-5 or 98 you can mix it you can fill
the<00:00:42.690> tank<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.530> bit<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the tank up with a little bit of one and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.319 
the tank up with a little bit of one and
a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> other<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
a little bit of the other so you go the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
a little bit of the other so you go the
track<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.020> fill<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> tank<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.250> e85

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
track and you fill the tank up with e85

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209 
track and you fill the tank up with e85
at<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> end<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> day<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.950> way<00:00:50.070> home

at the end of the day on your way home

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.100 
at the end of the day on your way home
go<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> service<00:00:51.000> station<00:00:51.300> fill<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> rest

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
go to the service station fill the rest

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.439 
go to the service station fill the rest
of<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.739> 98<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.640> flex<00:00:53.940> fuel<00:00:54.120> sensor

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
of it up with 98 the flex fuel sensor

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.110 
of it up with 98 the flex fuel sensor
will<00:00:54.809> recalibrate<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.010> settings<00:00:56.520> coming<00:00:56.940> out

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
will recalibrate the settings coming out

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
will recalibrate the settings coming out
of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.329> measured<00:00:57.719> ethanol<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> fuel

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
of the measured ethanol and the fuel

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
of the measured ethanol and the fuel
going<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> engine<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.180> signal<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
going into the engine that signal is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
going into the engine that signal is
then<00:01:00.840> interpreted<00:01:01.440> by<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> ECU<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
then interpreted by the ECU which is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
then interpreted by the ECU which is
enhanced<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.329> q-tip<00:01:03.510> software<00:01:04.140> using<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
enhanced with a q-tip software using the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
enhanced with a q-tip software using the
amount<00:01:05.280> cmap<00:01:05.729> designed<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.330> us<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.320> course

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
amount cmap designed by us and of course

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
amount cmap designed by us and of course
then<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:07.950> calibrate<00:01:08.549> itself<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> yes<00:01:09.510> there

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
then all calibrate itself and yes there

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.969 
then all calibrate itself and yes there
will<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> difference<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.500> power<00:01:10.710> because

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
will be a difference in power because

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
will be a difference in power because
obviously<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.119> diagraphs

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
obviously you can see in these diagraphs

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.350 
obviously you can see in these diagraphs
of<00:01:12.930> before<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.500> after<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> ex<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> power

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
of before and after with the ex a power

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.380 
of before and after with the ex a power
kit<00:01:15.630> before<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.320> tuna<00:01:16.680> 985<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> about

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
kit before we tuna 985 there is about

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
kit before we tuna 985 there is about
six<00:01:18.689> de<00:01:18.869> kilowatts<00:01:19.470> difference<00:01:19.890> after<00:01:20.159> wheels

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
six de kilowatts difference after wheels

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.480 
six de kilowatts difference after wheels
so<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> biasi<00:01:22.590> toyota<00:01:23.310> 86

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
so there you have it biasi toyota 86

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
so there you have it biasi toyota 86
