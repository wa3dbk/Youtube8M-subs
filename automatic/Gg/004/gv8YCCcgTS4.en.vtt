00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.060 
and it went for out of the post was it
was<00:00:51.180> pretty<00:00:51.390> stressful<00:00:51.539> too<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.170> looking<00:00:52.890> at

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
was pretty stressful too much looking at

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
was pretty stressful too much looking at
some<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> physical<00:00:53.610> attributes<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
some of the physical attributes as you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150 
some of the physical attributes as you
can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.360> 78<00:00:55.020> strength<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> worn<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> bit

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
can see 78 strength is worn that's a bit

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.670 
can see 78 strength is worn that's a bit
debatable<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.210> game<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.899> guy<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.140> possessed

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
debatable in game this guy is possessed

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
debatable in game this guy is possessed
so<00:00:58.949> easy<00:00:59.160> when<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.520> shoved<00:00:59.789> about<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.300> get

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so easy when you shoved about just get

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
so easy when you shoved about just get
to<00:01:00.870> pull<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> shoulder<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> he'll<00:01:02.250> very

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
to pull on the shoulder and he'll very

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
to pull on the shoulder and he'll very
easily<00:01:02.910> lose<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> ball<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> some

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
easily lose the ball but in some

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
easily lose the ball but in some
occasions<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.040> hold<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> ball<00:01:05.700> at

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
occasions he can hold up the ball at

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
occasions he can hold up the ball at
fairly<00:01:06.600> well<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.229> he<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.979> finish

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
fairly well as you can see he can finish

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
fairly well as you can see he can finish
I<00:01:08.549> mean<00:01:08.760> he's<00:01:08.850> finishing<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.420> 9090<00:01:09.840> should

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I mean he's finishing it at 9090 should

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
I mean he's finishing it at 9090 should
be<00:01:10.260> able<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> finish<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.250> decent<00:01:11.729> NASA

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
be able to finish and it's decent NASA

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
be able to finish and it's decent NASA
that's<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.810> great<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.380> decent<00:01:13.950> finishing

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that's not great it's decent finishing

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
that's not great it's decent finishing
one<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> his

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
one thing I do have to say is his

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.859 
one thing I do have to say is his
headers<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:18.090> powerful<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
headers are very very powerful that is

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
headers are very very powerful that is
one<00:01:19.080> thing<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.290> does<00:01:19.530> stand<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.070> as

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
one thing that does stand out to me as

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
one thing that does stand out to me as

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
he didn't feel 79 80 / so I felt pretty

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.160 
he didn't feel 79 80 / so I felt pretty
sluggish<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.879> me<00:02:24.970> he's<00:02:25.360> got<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> decent<00:02:25.750> shot<00:02:26.050> on
