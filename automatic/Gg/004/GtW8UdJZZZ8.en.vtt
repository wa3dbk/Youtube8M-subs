 Lord and midler menard is expressed by 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.370
 of fine nettle the name of kunar is a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.100
 another word actually to mean the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
 growl or grunt the headdress of 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.610

 about four years old they ignore 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.190
 also that he is transforming himself 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.710
 consciously but he keeps his 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.629
 personality in her mega dance forms 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910

 family I did some videos on 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.690
 I leave you the links in the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 description the story of dinars is 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.190
 told by the nerdy point of view 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.929
 it's the only gordon to have a tail 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.179
 so maybe it was precisely 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.429
 an evolution the name of bonnart can 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.890
 to be inspired by gnarr with two aces on 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.270
 the series serious m 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.250
 you know that narrative so suddenly can 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.039
