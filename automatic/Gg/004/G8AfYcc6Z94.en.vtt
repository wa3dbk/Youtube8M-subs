00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
first two games there's a very good

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
first two games there's a very good
chance<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.840> those<00:02:09.929> two<00:02:10.140> he<00:02:10.289> might<00:02:10.530> get

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
chance at one of those two he might get

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.309

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
then we feel that with sure might be the

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.030 
then we feel that with sure might be the
guy<00:02:12.999> really<00:02:13.299> on<00:02:13.480> long-term<00:02:13.920> regardless<00:02:14.920> we

guy really on long-term regardless we
don't<00:02:15.159> think<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> terrible<00:02:15.670> move<00:02:15.969> because

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
don't think it's a terrible move because

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.179 
don't think it's a terrible move because
you<00:02:16.239> can<00:02:16.329> get<00:02:16.420> Smith<00:02:16.719> and<00:02:16.959> Leshoure<00:02:17.680> very<00:02:17.920> late
