badly I'm not too sure if you can see it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
badly I'm not too sure if you can see it
in<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.400> cameras<00:00:23.789> picking<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
in the the cameras picking it up but I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.429 
in the the cameras picking it up but I
mean<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.439> thing<00:00:25.619> looks<00:00:25.859> pretty<00:00:26.099> bad<00:00:27.439> yes

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
mean this thing looks pretty bad yes

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.140 
mean this thing looks pretty bad yes
I've<00:00:28.740> dropped<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.310> couple<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.580> times<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I've dropped it a couple of times but I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
I've dropped it a couple of times but I
just<00:00:30.510> wouldn't<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.929> thought<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.890> would

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
just wouldn't have thought that it would

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.290 
just wouldn't have thought that it would
look<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:33.680> after<00:00:34.680> normal<00:00:35.489> use<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
look like this after normal use so I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
look like this after normal use so I
went<00:00:36.690> online<00:00:36.809> try<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.710> research

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
went online try to do a little research

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
went online try to do a little research
to<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> only<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.149> who<00:00:39.300> noticed

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to see if I was the only one who noticed

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.510 
to see if I was the only one who noticed
it<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> went<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> sitios<00:00:42.480> web<00:00:42.510> site<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
it and went to sitios web site and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.130 
it and went to sitios web site and
noticed<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.750> product<00:00:46.079> description

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
noticed that the product description

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.950 
noticed that the product description
says<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> case<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.809> supposed

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
says that the case is actually supposed

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
says that the case is actually supposed
to<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> smooth<00:00:50.030> finish<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.100> that<00:00:53.100> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to have a smooth finish and that is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
to have a smooth finish and that is
definitely<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> case<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> white

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
definitely not the case which is white

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.040 
definitely not the case which is white

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
feel it's a really smooth type of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
feel it's a really smooth type of
material<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> feel<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.960> really<00:01:15.960> nice

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
material kind of feel to it really nice

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.980 
material kind of feel to it really nice
it<00:01:16.380> feels<00:01:16.409> good<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.830> hand<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.570> don't<00:01:18.900> know

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it feels good in hand and I don't know

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.300 
it feels good in hand and I don't know
it<00:01:19.110> does<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.619> seem<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.159> more

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it does just seem a little bit more

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.960 
it does just seem a little bit more
sturdier<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.630> thought<00:01:22.290> I'd<00:01:22.439> give<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.710> shot

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
sturdier so thought I'd give it a shot

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.249 
sturdier so thought I'd give it a shot
the<00:01:23.970> only<00:01:24.150> downside<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.720> course<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the only downside of course with this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679 
the only downside of course with this
type<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> material<00:01:26.040> looks<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:27.570> could

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
type of material looks like you could

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
type of material looks like you could
probably<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.259> smudges<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.860> fingerprints

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
probably see smudges and fingerprints

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.670 
probably see smudges and fingerprints
but<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.119> don't<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.810> care<00:01:31.079> i<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.259> need<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
but I don't really care i just need to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
but I don't really care i just need to
think<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.130> come<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> protect<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.299> phone<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
think to come to protect the phone and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
think to come to protect the phone and
not<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.920> bad<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:37.729> for<00:01:38.729> those

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
not look as bad as this one so for those

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.280 
not look as bad as this one so for those
of<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.150> familiar<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.570> studios<00:01:39.840> cases

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
of you not familiar with studios cases

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.520 
of you not familiar with studios cases
is<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:41.040> simple<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.299> although<00:01:42.689> when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is pretty simple to get on although when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.319 
is pretty simple to get on although when
you<00:01:43.619> first<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.189> them<00:01:44.399> they're<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> tight

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you first get them they're kind of tight

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.670 
you first get them they're kind of tight
snug<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:47.689> sort<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.780> goes<00:01:48.960> away<00:01:49.200> after<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
snug that sort of goes away after a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560 
snug that sort of goes away after a
little<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> time<00:01:50.520> give<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> couple<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
little bit of time give it a couple of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.319 
little bit of time give it a couple of
weeks<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> lot<00:01:53.009> easier<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.119> on

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
weeks it would be a lot easier to get on

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.359 
weeks it would be a lot easier to get on
and<00:01:54.509> off<00:01:54.619> because<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.310> thing

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and off because right now this thing

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.569 
and off because right now this thing
