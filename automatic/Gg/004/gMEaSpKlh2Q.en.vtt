I<00:01:22.479> still<00:01:23.259> remember<00:01:23.380> our<00:01:23.770> goalkeeper<00:01:24.399> at<00:01:24.999> that

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
I still remember our goalkeeper at that

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.980 
I still remember our goalkeeper at that
point<00:01:25.389> T<00:01:25.719> NOLA<00:01:26.049> Terry<00:01:26.429> it<00:01:27.429> was<00:01:27.639> from<00:01:28.090> Ellie<00:01:28.299> but

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
point T NOLA Terry it was from Ellie but

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.160 
point T NOLA Terry it was from Ellie but
he<00:01:29.109> was<00:01:29.259> an<00:01:29.439> outstanding<00:01:29.789> goalkeeper<00:01:30.789> I<00:01:31.170> am

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
he was an outstanding goalkeeper I am

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.770 
he was an outstanding goalkeeper I am
Not<00:01:32.380> sure<00:01:32.409> of<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:33.039> history<00:01:33.729> before<00:01:34.060> he<00:01:34.539> came

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
Not sure of the history before he came

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.279 
Not sure of the history before he came
to<00:01:35.079> our<00:01:35.829> team<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:37.119> assuming<00:01:37.630> he<00:01:37.749> played<00:01:37.990> in

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
to our team I'm assuming he played in

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.940 
to our team I'm assuming he played in
Italian<00:01:38.799> leagues<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.600> perhaps<00:01:40.600> he<00:01:40.990> was<00:01:41.170> past

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
Italian leagues and perhaps he was past

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.059 
Italian leagues and perhaps he was past
his<00:01:42.159> prime<00:01:42.749> but<00:01:43.749> he's<00:01:43.899> still<00:01:44.170> quite<00:01:44.380> quite<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
his prime but he's still quite quite the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.090 
his prime but he's still quite quite the
good<00:01:45.249> goalkeeper<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:47.619> you<00:01:47.740> faced<00:01:47.979> any

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
good goalkeeper have you faced any

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.279 
good goalkeeper have you faced any
challenges<00:01:48.700> being<00:01:48.969> a<00:01:49.179> fan<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.719> non<00:01:49.929> soccer

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
challenges being a fan in a non soccer

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.889 
challenges being a fan in a non soccer
country<00:01:50.709> like<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:51.100> United<00:01:51.369> States<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:52.600> much

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
country like the United States very much

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.969 
country like the United States very much
so<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.090> initial<00:01:55.749> league<00:01:56.109> folded<00:01:56.709> and<00:01:56.889> I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
so when that initial league folded and I

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.410 
so when that initial league folded and I
think<00:01:57.249> it<00:01:57.369> folded<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.819> early<00:01:58.090> eighties

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
think it folded in the early eighties

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.199 
think it folded in the early eighties
and<00:01:59.350> okay<00:01:59.619> lis<00:01:59.770> retired<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.639> know<00:02:00.700> consoles

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.630 
Euro 2008 the summer so that's that's
incredibly<00:03:48.140> promising<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.890> encouraging

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
incredibly promising and encouraging

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.949 
incredibly promising and encouraging
that<00:03:49.820> we<00:03:50.570> can<00:03:50.810> see<00:03:51.049> these<00:03:51.470> new<00:03:51.940> or<00:03:52.940> see<00:03:53.810> the

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
that we can see these new or see the

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.720 
that we can see these new or see the
existing<00:03:54.230> teams<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.920> get<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.220> exposure<00:03:55.549> in

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
existing teams and get to exposure in

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.309 
existing teams and get to exposure in
America<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.239> serves

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.699 

I<00:04:02.829> think<00:04:03.640> it's<00:04:03.819> progressing<00:04:04.709> positively

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
I think it's progressing positively

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.729 
I think it's progressing positively
encouraging<00:04:06.670> but<00:04:07.629> very<00:04:08.019> slowly

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
encouraging but very slowly

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.750 
encouraging but very slowly
I<00:04:08.769> think<00:04:09.400> we<00:04:09.579> need<00:04:09.819> more<00:04:10.530> time<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.549> needs

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
I think we need more time and it needs

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.099 
I think we need more time and it needs
more<00:04:12.939> exposure<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:14.219> gain<00:04:15.219> a<00:04:15.249> a<00:04:16.470> firm<00:04:17.699> foothold

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
more exposure to gain a a firm foothold

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.439 
more exposure to gain a a firm foothold
within<00:04:20.109> American<00:04:21.099> sports

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
within American sports

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.560 
within American sports
I<00:04:23.009> think<00:04:24.009> David<00:04:24.460> Beckham<00:04:24.759> has<00:04:25.090> been<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.330> big

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
I think David Beckham has been a big

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.040 
I think David Beckham has been a big
help

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
help

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.570 
help
I<00:04:27.270> think<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:29.169> exposure<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:29.979> World<00:04:30.190> Cup<00:04:30.430> in

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
I think the exposure to the World Cup in

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.020 
I think the exposure to the World Cup in
2006<00:04:31.240> has<00:04:32.020> been<00:04:32.349> a<00:04:32.380> big<00:04:32.620> help<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.160> hopefully

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
2006 has been a big help and hopefully

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.480 
2006 has been a big help and hopefully
that<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.389> continue<00:04:35.070> do<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.160> think<00:04:36.370> it'll

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
that can continue do you think it'll

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.950 
that can continue do you think it'll
ever<00:04:36.610> reach<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:36.910> popularity<00:04:37.419> some<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.900> the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
ever reach the popularity some of the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.740 
ever reach the popularity some of the
more<00:04:38.110> popular<00:04:38.410> American<00:04:38.889> sports<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.430> don't<00:04:40.060> I'm

more popular American sports I don't I'm
not<00:04:40.840> sure<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.560> would<00:04:42.070> doubt<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.599> America<00:04:43.599> seems

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
not sure I would doubt it America seems

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.529 
not sure I would doubt it America seems
to<00:04:43.990> be<00:04:45.630> concentrating<00:04:46.630> on<00:04:46.750> American<00:04:47.680> football

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
to be concentrating on American football

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.760 
to be concentrating on American football
as<00:04:49.539> well<00:04:49.599> as<00:04:50.199> baseball<00:04:50.860> basketball<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:53.440> I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
as well as baseball basketball so I

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.420 
as well as baseball basketball so I
think<00:04:54.960> while<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.289> will<00:04:56.440> grow<00:04:56.680> in<00:04:56.770> popularity<00:04:57.220> I

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
think while it will grow in popularity I

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.300 
think while it will grow in popularity I
don't<00:04:57.699> think<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:57.970> will<00:04:58.030> ever<00:04:58.120> be<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.389> dominant

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
don't think it will ever be the dominant

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.249 
don't think it will ever be the dominant
sports<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.699> should<00:05:01.120> say<00:05:01.539> never<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:02.020> say<00:05:02.199> never

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
sports I should say never to say never

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.120 
sports I should say never to say never
but<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.550> would<00:05:04.060> hope<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.419> won<00:05:04.599> but<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.620> think<00:05:06.039> it's

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
but I would hope it won but I think it's

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.430 
but I would hope it won but I think it's
gonna<00:05:06.220> take<00:05:06.430> longer<00:05:06.610> than<00:05:06.729> 15<00:05:07.180> years<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.720> think

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
gonna take longer than 15 years I think

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.980 
gonna take longer than 15 years I think
it's<00:05:08.560> gonna<00:05:08.710> take<00:05:08.949> some<00:05:09.639> where<00:05:09.789> 30<00:05:10.419> years<00:05:10.720> or

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
it's gonna take some where 30 years or

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.589 
it's gonna take some where 30 years or
even<00:05:11.020> more<00:05:11.440> for<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.520> gain<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:12.940> real<00:05:13.210> firm

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
even more for it to gain a real firm

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.770 
even more for it to gain a real firm
foothold<00:05:13.960> in<00:05:14.560> America<00:05:14.979> as<00:05:15.669> as<00:05:16.030> one<00:05:16.630> of<00:05:16.720> the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
foothold in America as as one of the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.850 
foothold in America as as one of the
more<00:05:16.930> popular<00:05:17.169> sports<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:20.470> course<00:05:20.680> that's

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
more popular sports and of course that's

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.700 
more popular sports and of course that's
very<00:05:21.159> dependent<00:05:21.880> upon<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.150> other<00:05:22.270> sports

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
very dependent upon the other sports

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.570 
very dependent upon the other sports
lessening<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:23.860> popularity<00:05:24.400> as<00:05:24.580> well<00:05:24.759> I<00:05:26.130> do<00:05:27.130> not

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
lessening in popularity as well I do not

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.089 
lessening in popularity as well I do not
follow<00:05:27.820> major<00:05:28.389> league<00:05:28.630> soccer<00:05:28.840> very<00:05:29.409> much<00:05:29.650> I

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
follow major league soccer very much I

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.330 
follow major league soccer very much I
seen<00:05:30.759> some<00:05:31.210> matches<00:05:31.690> here<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.199> there<00:05:32.409> but

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
seen some matches here and there but

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.830 
seen some matches here and there but
nothing<00:05:33.520> on<00:05:33.759> the<00:05:33.880> level<00:05:34.150> where<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.360> could<00:05:34.599> speak

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
nothing on the level where I could speak

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.270 
nothing on the level where I could speak
with<00:05:35.440> any<00:05:35.650> knowledge<00:05:35.889> about<00:05:36.220> them<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:38.289> do<00:05:38.949> think

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
with any knowledge about them I do think

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.640 
with any knowledge about them I do think
it's<00:05:39.430> progressing<00:05:39.880> well<00:05:40.000> but<00:05:40.240> again<00:05:40.650> in

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
it's progressing well but again in

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.350 
it's progressing well but again in
reference<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.430> last<00:05:42.729> question<00:05:42.909> I<00:05:43.300> think

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
reference to the last question I think

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.570 
reference to the last question I think
it's<00:05:43.599> going<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.780> take<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:43.960> long<00:05:44.199> time<00:05:44.440> for<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.400> to

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
it's going to take a long time for it to

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.260 
it's going to take a long time for it to
become<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:47.130> dominant<00:05:48.130> sports<00:05:48.490> or<00:05:48.759> at<00:05:48.880> least<00:05:49.090> a

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
become a dominant sports or at least a

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.969 
become a dominant sports or at least a
popular<00:05:49.900> sport<00:05:50.259> in<00:05:50.469> America<00:05:52.469> do<00:05:53.469> you<00:05:53.560> think<00:05:53.770> -

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
popular sport in America do you think -

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.649 
popular sport in America do you think -
but<00:05:54.159> I<00:05:54.250> think<00:05:54.699> David<00:05:54.849> Beckham<00:05:55.300> is<00:05:55.449> helping<00:05:57.659> he

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
but I think David Beckham is helping he

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.659 
but I think David Beckham is helping he
helped<00:05:59.050> initially<00:05:59.500> with<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.800> exposure<00:06:00.190> and

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
helped initially with the exposure and

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.659 
helped initially with the exposure and
of<00:06:00.909> course<00:06:01.150> it<00:06:01.990> helped<00:06:02.409> when<00:06:02.650> he<00:06:02.889> was<00:06:03.099> then

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
of course it helped when he was then

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.189 
of course it helped when he was then
playing<00:06:03.909> friendly<00:06:04.360> matches<00:06:04.570> throughout<00:06:04.990> the

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
playing friendly matches throughout the

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.339 
playing friendly matches throughout the
country<00:06:05.650> even<00:06:06.460> our<00:06:06.580> local<00:06:06.820> minor<00:06:07.719> league<00:06:08.020> team

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
country even our local minor league team

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.629 
country even our local minor league team
the<00:06:08.680> Minnesota<00:06:09.190> Thunder<00:06:10.740> played<00:06:11.740> against<00:06:12.130> Los

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
the Minnesota Thunder played against Los

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.250 
the Minnesota Thunder played against Los
Angeles<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.210> think<00:06:13.389> it's<00:06:13.510> Los<00:06:13.659> Angeles<00:06:13.690> Galaxy

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
Angeles I think it's Los Angeles Galaxy

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.660 
Angeles I think it's Los Angeles Galaxy
SIII<00:06:14.889> I'm<00:06:15.250> not<00:06:15.460> even

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
SIII I'm not even

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.700 
SIII I'm not even
certain<00:06:15.970> on<00:06:16.090> the<00:06:16.120> names<00:06:16.390> Los<00:06:17.140> Angeles<00:06:17.530> Galaxy

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
certain on the names Los Angeles Galaxy

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.150 
certain on the names Los Angeles Galaxy
and<00:06:18.220> with<00:06:19.090> David<00:06:19.420> Beckham<00:06:19.720> and<00:06:19.870> that<00:06:20.860> helps

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
and with David Beckham and that helps

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.640 
and with David Beckham and that helps
because<00:06:21.280> our<00:06:21.520> local<00:06:21.820> media<00:06:21.970> covered<00:06:22.510> it<00:06:22.650> which

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
because our local media covered it which

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.550 
because our local media covered it which
you<00:06:24.430> know<00:06:24.520> that<00:06:24.760> certainly<00:06:25.360> helps<00:06:25.780> but<00:06:26.050> like

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
you know that certainly helps but like

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.780 
you know that certainly helps but like
Paley<00:06:27.040> with<00:06:27.760> New<00:06:27.970> York<00:06:28.150> Cosmos<00:06:28.330> I<00:06:28.900> think<00:06:29.790> there

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
Paley with New York Cosmos I think there

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.150 
Paley with New York Cosmos I think there
Beckham<00:06:31.180> can<00:06:31.390> only<00:06:31.510> do<00:06:31.720> so<00:06:31.900> much<00:06:32.140> as<00:06:32.440> one

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
Beckham can only do so much as one

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.370 
Beckham can only do so much as one
person<00:06:33.610> I<00:06:33.760> think<00:06:34.090> we<00:06:34.240> need<00:06:34.420> more<00:06:34.720> quality

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
person I think we need more quality

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.220 
person I think we need more quality
players<00:06:36.030> international<00:06:37.030> players<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:38.050> come

here and regardless if they are past

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.500 
here and regardless if they are past
their<00:06:40.690> prime<00:06:40.930> or<00:06:41.290> not<00:06:42.000> but<00:06:43.000> if<00:06:43.090> we<00:06:43.180> can<00:06:43.360> get

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
their prime or not but if we can get

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.560 
their prime or not but if we can get
multiple<00:06:43.780> players<00:06:44.350> here<00:06:44.970> of<00:06:45.970> higher<00:06:46.300> quality

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
multiple players here of higher quality

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.800 
multiple players here of higher quality
and<00:06:47.200> then<00:06:47.770> develop<00:06:48.280> players<00:06:49.120> within<00:06:49.570> our<00:06:49.690> own

and then develop players within our own

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.980 
and then develop players within our own
country<00:06:50.350> as<00:06:50.830> well<00:06:51.160> as<00:06:51.280> encouraging<00:06:51.990> younger

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
know I've not followed it too closely I

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.890 
know I've not followed it too closely I
did<00:07:05.950> see<00:07:06.220> the<00:07:06.400> final<00:07:06.790> last<00:07:06.970> year<00:07:07.300> I<00:07:07.330> believe<00:07:07.570> it

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.990 
did see the final last year I believe it
was<00:07:07.960> Houston<00:07:08.200> against<00:07:08.710> New<00:07:08.860> England<00:07:09.250> and<00:07:09.880> I

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
was Houston against New England and I

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.270 
was Houston against New England and I
was<00:07:10.120> impressed<00:07:10.270> with<00:07:10.690> the<00:07:10.810> Houston<00:07:11.170> Club<00:07:11.380> but

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
was impressed with the Houston Club but

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.720 
was impressed with the Houston Club but
I<00:07:12.850> really<00:07:13.540> don't<00:07:13.720> have<00:07:14.050> a<00:07:14.320> favorite<00:07:14.530> MLS<00:07:15.400> club

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.730 
I really don't have a favorite MLS club

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:26.300 
I really don't have a favorite MLS club
yet<00:07:16.300> hopefully<00:07:17.290> that<00:07:17.440> will<00:07:17.530> change

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.370
