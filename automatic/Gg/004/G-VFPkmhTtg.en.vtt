and they also smoked pot at the end so I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.270 
and they also smoked pot at the end so I
didn't<00:02:57.090> link<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.450> tonight<00:02:57.810> because<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.440> be

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
didn't link it tonight because I be

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.710 
didn't link it tonight because I be
careful<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.090> know<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.300> mean<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.660> is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
careful you know I mean this is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.380 
careful you know I mean this is
reflection<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.710> me<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:02.580> use<00:03:03.120> those

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
reflection on me and I don't use those

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.230 
reflection on me and I don't use those
words<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.110> don't<00:03:04.350> smoke<00:03:05.190> pot<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.850> thought

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
words and I don't smoke pot so I thought

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.630 
words and I don't smoke pot so I thought
it<00:03:06.510> would<00:03:06.540> be<00:03:06.780> better<00:03:06.960> not<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.890> link<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.400> but

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
it would be better not to link it but

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.060 
it would be better not to link it but
anyway<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> very<00:03:10.200> cute<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.710> somebody

a<00:04:54.040> little<00:04:54.220> bit<00:04:54.430> in<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:55.500> some<00:04:56.500> nice<00:04:56.680> flavor

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.020 

and<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.620> birds<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:05.890> it<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.160> rest<00:05:06.510> eventually

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
and the birds of it the rest eventually

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.440 
and the birds of it the rest eventually
ok<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:10.090> now<00:05:10.450> let's<00:05:10.979> make<00:05:11.979> pancakes<00:05:12.400> let's<00:05:13.240> see

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
ok so now let's make pancakes let's see

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.990 
ok so now let's make pancakes let's see
how<00:05:13.570> long<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.930> takes<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.169> make<00:05:14.380> pancakes<00:05:15.000> so

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
how long it takes to make pancakes so

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
how long it takes to make pancakes so
let's<00:05:16.810> put<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.110> timer<00:05:17.320> on<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.530> 652<00:05:18.900> well<00:05:19.900> I

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
let's put the timer on it 652 well I

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.659 
let's put the timer on it 652 well I
guess<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.470> should<00:05:20.650> put<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.919> other<00:05:21.130> dreamer<00:05:21.520> on

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
guess I should put the other dreamer on

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.040 
guess I should put the other dreamer on
so<00:05:21.850> I<00:05:21.910> know<00:05:22.000> how<00:05:22.180> much<00:05:22.360> time<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.630> really<00:05:23.020> got

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
so I know how much time I really got

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.580 
so I know how much time I really got
here<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:24.780> don't<00:05:25.780> have<00:05:25.870> enough<00:05:26.080> time<00:05:26.289> on<00:05:26.470> here

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
here I don't have enough time on here

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.140
