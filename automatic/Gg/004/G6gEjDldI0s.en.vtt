something that will revolutionize

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.509 
something that will revolutionize
redstone<00:00:12.870> as<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.320> know<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:14.190> might<00:00:14.460> be

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
redstone as we know it it might be

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.070 
redstone as we know it it might be
stupid<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.750> might<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.670> unpractical

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
stupid it might be unpractical

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.909 
stupid it might be unpractical
yeah<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.689> wide<00:00:21.929> and<00:00:22.349> tileable

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
yeah it is a one wide and tileable

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.409 
yeah it is a one wide and tileable
chicken<00:00:23.430> farm<00:00:23.669> yay<00:00:24.890> um<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.090> guys<00:00:27.239> are

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
chicken farm yay um now you guys are

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.410 
chicken farm yay um now you guys are
wondering<00:00:27.829> why

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.390 

and<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.320> I<00:00:32.440> and<00:00:32.650> I<00:00:32.740> don't<00:00:32.800> have<00:00:33.040> an<00:00:33.130> answer<00:00:33.370> to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
and and I and I don't have an answer to

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.569 
and and I and I don't have an answer to
that<00:00:33.640> actually

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
that actually

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.040 
that actually
yeah

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.360 

I<00:00:40.080> don't<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.190> why<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.020> guess<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.220> bit

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
I don't know why so I guess a little bit

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.960 
I don't know why so I guess a little bit
bit<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.970> brief<00:00:45.360> history<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
bit of brief history that's this is the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.860 
bit of brief history that's this is the
sort<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.060> design<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> used<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.800> basic

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
sort of design I used it's very basic

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.090 
sort of design I used it's very basic
this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> first<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.470> came<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:52.950> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
this is the first one I came out with it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.440 
this is the first one I came out with it
was<00:00:53.160> pretty<00:00:53.430> massive<00:00:53.700> kind<00:00:54.150> of<00:00:54.210> annoying

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
was pretty massive kind of annoying

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.270 
was pretty massive kind of annoying
works<00:00:55.080> pretty<00:00:55.230> fine<00:00:55.470> what<00:00:55.710> happens<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.130> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
works pretty fine what happens is the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.980 
works pretty fine what happens is the
chicken<00:00:56.940> lays<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.210> egg<00:00:57.240> here<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.750> gets<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
chicken lays an egg here it gets it

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.020 
chicken lays an egg here it gets it
detected<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.950> goes<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.400> here<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.760> clock

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
detected and goes into here the clock

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.410 
detected and goes into here the clock
fires<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.540> egg<00:01:00.660> into<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:02.130> cauldron<00:01:02.880> baby

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
fires the egg into the cauldron baby

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.150 
fires the egg into the cauldron baby
chicken<00:01:03.780> chills<00:01:04.050> on<00:01:04.170> psychology<00:01:04.740> until<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
chicken chills on psychology until it

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.910 
chicken chills on psychology until it
grows<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.520> and<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.150> burns<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.710> lava

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
grows up and it burns because the lava

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.060 
grows up and it burns because the lava
is<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.790> burn<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> baby<00:01:09.300> chicken<00:01:09.660> or<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is will burn the baby chicken or in the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.290 
is will burn the baby chicken or in the
adult<00:01:11.400> chicken<00:01:11.700> won't<00:01:11.790> bring<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> baby

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
adult chicken won't bring the baby

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.120 
adult chicken won't bring the baby
chicken<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.229> jobs<00:01:13.440> go<00:01:13.620> down<00:01:13.770> into

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
chicken and then it's jobs go down into

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.870 
chicken and then it's jobs go down into
the<00:01:14.220> chest<00:01:15.620> then<00:01:16.620> dro<00:01:17.070> came<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.760> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the chest then dro came up with this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280 
the chest then dro came up with this
design<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.479> pretty<00:01:18.660> awesome

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
design which is pretty awesome

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
design which is pretty awesome
basically<00:01:19.560> compacts<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> by<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.580> block<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
basically compacts it by one block this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.590 
basically compacts it by one block this
way<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> makes<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.470> couple<00:01:23.040> dicks<00:01:23.340> quicker

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
way and makes it a couple dicks quicker

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.780 
way and makes it a couple dicks quicker
I<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:26.979> tick<00:01:27.220> quicker<00:01:27.430> might

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
I think just one tick quicker might

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.399 
I think just one tick quicker might
actually<00:01:27.909> be<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.180> same<00:01:28.330> speed<00:01:28.659> I<00:01:28.900> don't<00:01:29.259> think

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
actually be the same speed I don't think

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.840 
actually be the same speed I don't think
about<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.619> I<00:01:29.920> don't<00:01:30.130> know<00:01:30.280> but<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.640> pretty

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
about it I don't know but it's pretty

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.289 
about it I don't know but it's pretty
awesome

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
awesome

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.240 
awesome
one<00:01:31.689> box<00:01:31.900> smaller<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.650> came<00:01:32.799> up<00:01:32.890> with<00:01:32.979> this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
one box smaller and I came up with this

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.550 
one box smaller and I came up with this
design<00:01:33.580> which<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.030> incredibly<00:01:34.960> quick<00:01:35.200> I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
design which is incredibly quick I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.990 
design which is incredibly quick I
assure<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.460> right<00:01:36.670> now

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
assure you this right now

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.380 
assure you this right now
it<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:37.960> handle<00:01:38.290> large<00:01:39.070> quantities<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.850> Exile

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
it can handle large quantities of Exile

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.090 
it can handle large quantities of Exile
just<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.780> los<00:01:40.990> she's<00:01:41.170> leaning<00:01:41.409> like<00:01:41.649> I<00:01:41.860> am

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
just in los she's leaning like I am

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.690 
just in los she's leaning like I am
blocks<00:01:42.369> into<00:01:42.580> here<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.509> can<00:01:43.690> shoot<00:01:44.549> items<00:01:45.549> I

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
blocks into here it can shoot items I

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.920 
blocks into here it can shoot items I
think<00:01:45.729> Caleb<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.149> cook<00:01:46.299> speeds<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:46.840> the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
think Caleb we cook speeds but the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.060 
think Caleb we cook speeds but the
problem<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.289> if<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.500> throw<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.680> bunch<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.950> them

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
problem is if you throw a bunch of them

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.010 
problem is if you throw a bunch of them
in<00:01:48.310> there<00:01:48.430> at<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.700> same<00:01:48.850> time<00:01:49.119> you<00:01:49.750> cannot

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
in there at the same time you cannot

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.910 
in there at the same time you cannot
handle<00:01:50.289> them<00:01:50.530> because<00:01:50.860> uh<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.759> uses<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> Chiti

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
handle them because uh it uses a Chiti

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.260 
handle them because uh it uses a Chiti
burnout<00:01:53.920> clock<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:54.850> really<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.119> that

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
burnout clock I do not really like that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.740 
burnout clock I do not really like that
much<00:01:56.789> so<00:01:57.789> that<00:01:57.880> was<00:01:57.970> my<00:01:58.060> second<00:01:58.330> site<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:58.659> then

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
much so that was my second site and then

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.660 
much so that was my second site and then
I<00:01:58.810> can't<00:01:59.020> with<00:01:59.259> but<00:01:59.619> it's<00:01:59.770> also<00:02:00.039> really<00:02:00.310> small

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
I can't with but it's also really small

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.460 
I can't with but it's also really small
um<00:02:00.909> then<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.450> came<00:02:01.539> up<00:02:01.690> with<00:02:01.750> this<00:02:01.899> design<00:02:02.229> which

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
um then I came up with this design which

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.590 
um then I came up with this design which
uses<00:02:02.860> hoppers<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:05.050> stuff<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.210> same

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
uses hoppers and stuff and it's a same

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.449 
uses hoppers and stuff and it's a same
size<00:02:07.810> as<00:02:07.990> Joe's<00:02:08.229> design<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:08.739> it's<00:02:08.890> one<00:02:09.130> block

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
size as Joe's design but it's one block

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.680 
size as Joe's design but it's one block
you<00:02:09.670> know<00:02:09.819> less<00:02:10.690> tall<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:13.060> has<00:02:13.239> uses<00:02:13.569> a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
you know less tall and it has uses a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.130 
you know less tall and it has uses a
hopper<00:02:14.019> clock<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.769> power<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.930> dispenser<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
hopper clock to power the dispenser and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.140 
hopper clock to power the dispenser and
I<00:02:17.680> came<00:02:17.860> up<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.370> which<00:02:18.819> is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
I came up with this one which is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.350 
I came up with this one which is
tileable<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:21.730> course<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.120> should<00:02:22.269> probably

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
tileable and of course I should probably

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.509 
tileable and of course I should probably
do<00:02:22.630> something<00:02:22.660> about<00:02:23.049> I<00:02:23.470> should<00:02:24.100> probably<00:02:24.340> not

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
do something about I should probably not

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.059 
do something about I should probably not
use<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.110> should<00:02:26.410> probably<00:02:26.590> use<00:02:26.830> something

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
use that I should probably use something

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.440 
use that I should probably use something
like<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:30.220> top<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.670> then<00:02:31.090> there's<00:02:31.269> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
like that on top and then there's this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.449 
like that on top and then there's this
design<00:02:31.750> which<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.590> guess<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.829> same<00:02:33.250> thing

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
design which is I guess that same thing

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.869 
design which is I guess that same thing
but<00:02:34.019> tiled<00:02:35.019> and

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.440 

hooked<00:02:38.510> up<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.750> an<00:02:38.840> item<00:02:38.989> sorter<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.879> yeah<00:02:41.180> that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
hooked up to an item sorter so yeah that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.679 
hooked up to an item sorter so yeah that
is<00:02:41.599> basically<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.819> have<00:02:43.969> for<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.209> today<00:02:44.239> um

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
little bit because I didn't remove them

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.100 
little bit because I didn't remove them
correctly<00:03:34.860> um<00:03:35.430> she's<00:03:36.390> actually<00:03:36.540> redo<00:03:36.959> this

really quickly
for<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.190> sake<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.549> redeeming<00:03:39.450> myself<00:03:39.629> on

for the sake of redeeming myself on
camera<00:03:41.780> ones<00:03:42.780> like<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.260> then<00:03:43.349> you<00:03:43.440> want

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
camera ones like this and then you want

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.720 
camera ones like this and then you want
to<00:03:43.620> pop<00:03:43.799> down<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.130> schools<00:03:44.310> right<00:03:44.430> there<00:03:44.610> and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
to pop down your schools right there and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.729 
to pop down your schools right there and
that<00:03:44.819> will<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.120> know<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.590> separate<00:03:46.590> this

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
that will you know just separate this

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.289 
that will you know just separate this
lava<00:03:46.950> source<00:03:47.220> right<00:03:47.370> here<00:03:47.430> or<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:48.090> lava

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
lava source right here or this lava

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.180 
lava source right here or this lava
block<00:03:48.569> right<00:03:48.750> there<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.440> then<00:03:49.890> he's<00:03:50.010> gonna

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
block right there and then he's gonna

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.199 
block right there and then he's gonna
pop<00:03:50.310> them<00:03:50.489> down<00:03:50.630> right<00:03:51.890> here<00:03:52.950> oops<00:03:53.310> click<00:03:54.030> on

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
pop them down right here oops click on

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.660 
pop them down right here oops click on
those<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.660> me<00:03:54.930> showing<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.349> off<00:03:55.470> earlier<00:03:55.860> and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
those for me showing it off earlier and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.690 
those for me showing it off earlier and
then<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.140> will<00:03:58.430> these<00:03:59.430> lava

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
then like that and that will these lava

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.490 
then like that and that will these lava
blocks<00:03:59.879> will<00:04:00.060> stay<00:04:00.209> here<00:04:00.360> forever<00:04:00.629> and<00:04:00.900> then

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
blocks will stay here forever and then

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.949 
blocks will stay here forever and then
you<00:04:01.620> kinda<00:04:01.829> get<00:04:02.069> rid<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.220> these<00:04:02.629> like<00:04:03.629> that<00:04:03.810> to

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
you kinda get rid of these like that to

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.180 
you kinda get rid of these like that to
make<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.200> I'm<00:04:04.319> messy<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.739> then<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.069> move

make it I'm messy and then you can move
with<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.400> glass<00:04:05.579> blocks<00:04:05.910> over<00:04:06.090> here<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:10.940> boom

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
with the glass blocks over here and boom

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.550 
with the glass blocks over here and boom
boom<00:04:12.569> boom<00:04:14.600> boom<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:16.160> there<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.370> go<00:04:17.579> so
