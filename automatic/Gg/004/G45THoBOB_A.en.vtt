00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 and hi everyone 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.139
 today we are on gta 5 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.019
 online so on xbox ron so after the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.849
 update the crime pays part 2 so 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.460
 there we meet for a small video 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.160
 so information so here I thank 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 right away sir genki and diot 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.210
 mita for helping me to realize 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 this little video 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 so before we start just a little 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.449
 detail on the 4-4 burns so there 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.180
 look good the headlights are on and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.770
 so the accessories of the headlights that are 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.059
 on top of that does not turn on so there 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.440
 I'm just a little disappointed on it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.149
 so it's useless at all 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.570
 that we can add them because it does not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.860
 does not even light up so here we go all 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.450
 right away so start this video 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.899
 information that will make you so 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 recover up to 550 thousand dollars 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.930
 so here I make you the first screen to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 the screen so we have 25% off 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
 so on the first buyout so the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.350
 vehicle bought so at legendary 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.750
 motorsport so it's this week 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 until the 15th of July so that's before the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 July 15th so in fact there are three 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.640
 terms 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.500
 so in fact we will be reimbursed on 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270
 May 19 before there are three conditions 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.150
 so in fact you have to check his 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.740
 email address there is listed on the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.210
 mailing list of rockstar games and 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.100
 to be in a hole so there look good 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.570
 the screen on screen so once we 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.830

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.660
 so directly the cuts you 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.000
 are going to have for vehicles 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.250
 so me in fact I based myself so 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.870
 on dlc vehicles so there by 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.820

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.790
 will be reimbursed so 150 $ 7500 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.930
 then for the tvh a super moncla 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.519

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.709
 fifty thousand dollars 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:09.160
 so that will be the maximum then for 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.470

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.830
 dollars then for lavapies just to

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.030
 dollars 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.860

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.430
 the all terrain you are going to be 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.989

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.299
 so you are already set so on the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.090
 reimbursement therefore dlc vehicles 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.260
 part 2 so the crime peg after could 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.400
 be reimbursed on all others 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.470
 vehicles you are going to buy 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 but there will therefore calculate yourself 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.260
 the 25% compared to the price that is worth 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.159
 so the vehicle 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.930
 I hope that in any case this little 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.549
