here it and it has this little button

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220 
here it and it has this little button
here<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> press<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.079> press

here that will if you press it up press

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
here that will if you press it up press
it<00:00:37.410> won't<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.680> say<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.790> turns<00:00:39.059> off

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it won't they say this way it turns off

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
it won't they say this way it turns off
the<00:00:39.239> screen<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.110> turn<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.590> off

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
so it's very flexible in that sense

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
so it's very flexible in that sense
there<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> camera<00:00:44.879> itself<00:00:45.090> again<00:00:45.510> it's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
there so the camera itself again it's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
there so the camera itself again it's
sort<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> new<00:00:46.920> generation<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.910> Sony's<00:00:48.390> a

Bloggie line which is the the line that
sort<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> competes<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.989> well<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.680> least<00:00:52.800> used

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
sort of competes with well at least used

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
sort of competes with well at least used
to<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> flip<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.149> I'll<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> know

the kodak place where it's tiny and
things<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
things like that

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.770 
things like that
the<00:00:58.530> camera<00:00:58.890> itself<00:00:59.340> first<00:00:59.940> off<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the camera itself first off this is the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
the camera itself first off this is the
purple<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.340> even<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
would say the darkest one anyway I've

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.620 
would say the darkest one anyway I've
been<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> week

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
been using this here for about a week

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.789 
been using this here for about a week
now<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.000> pros<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.630> nice<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.320> lightweight

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
now and pros it is nice and lightweight

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.950 
now and pros it is nice and lightweight
it<00:01:29.460> takes<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.200> decent<00:01:31.200> quality<00:01:31.470> video<00:01:32.329> I'm<00:01:33.329> kind

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it takes a decent quality video I'm kind

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
it takes a decent quality video I'm kind
of<00:01:34.049> spoiled<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:34.799> using<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.340> camera

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of spoiled because I'm using the camera

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
of spoiled because I'm using the camera
I'm<00:01:35.700> recording<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
I'm recording on right now which is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.249 
I'm recording on right now which is
another<00:01:37.740> Sony<00:01:38.070> camera<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> cx-5<00:01:39.329> 5ob

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
another Sony camera the cx-5 5ob

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620 
another Sony camera the cx-5 5ob
but<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.070> much<00:01:41.490> more<00:01:41.759> higher-end<00:01:42.030> camera

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
but it's a much more higher-end camera

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.370 
but it's a much more higher-end camera
so<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> video<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.259> much<00:01:43.799> clearer<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.119> one

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
so the video is much clearer on this one

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.920 
so the video is much clearer on this one
but<00:01:46.430> quality<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> video<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.479> bad<00:01:48.720> on

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
but quality of the video is not bad on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.620 
but quality of the video is not bad on
here<00:01:49.110> does<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.590> 1080p<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.880> something

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
here does do 1080p which is something

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.140 
here does do 1080p which is something
that<00:01:51.960> none<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.530> Cisco

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
that none of the Cisco

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.570 
that none of the Cisco
flipz<00:01:53.390> did<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.410> that<00:01:55.040> was<00:01:55.070> one<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.430> main

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
flipz did so that was one of the main

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.790 
flipz did so that was one of the main
reasons<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.540> second<00:01:56.900> screen<00:01:57.140> why<00:01:57.470> I

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
reasons that in the second screen why I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.580 
reasons that in the second screen why I
was<00:01:58.250> looking<00:01:58.520> for<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.790> over<00:01:59.240> other<00:02:00.170> models

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
was looking for this over other models

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.800 
was looking for this over other models
the<00:02:01.040> sound<00:02:01.460> quality<00:02:01.970> though<00:02:02.120> it<00:02:02.600> has<00:02:02.780> a

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the sound quality though it has a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.020 
the sound quality though it has a
microphone<00:02:03.410> right<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:04.820> side

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
microphone right here and on this side

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.970 
microphone right here and on this side
it's<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.450> speaker<00:02:05.690> for<00:02:05.990> playback<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.680> sound

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
it's a speaker for playback the sound

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.370 
it's a speaker for playback the sound
quality<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.490> only<00:02:07.940> mono<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.899> microphone

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
quality is only mono for the microphone

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.460 
quality is only mono for the microphone
so<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.759> definitely<00:02:11.600> leaves<00:02:11.810> something<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.380> be

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
so it definitely leaves something to be

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.260 
so it definitely leaves something to be
desired<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:14.320> but<00:02:15.670> other<00:02:16.670> than<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.090> I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
desired on that but other than that I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.050 
desired on that but other than that I
mean<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> small<00:02:18.410> pocket<00:02:18.800> camera<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.640> not

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
mean for a small pocket camera it's not

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.190 
mean for a small pocket camera it's not
that<00:02:20.480> bad<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.350> doing<00:02:21.800> videos<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.250> whatnot<00:02:23.200> my

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
that bad for doing videos and whatnot my

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.130 
that bad for doing videos and whatnot my
own<00:02:24.350> personal<00:02:25.300> problem<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> have<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:26.720> it

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
own personal problem that I have with it

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.980 
own personal problem that I have with it
here<00:02:27.380> though<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.860> not<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.760> camera<00:02:29.090> itself<00:02:29.450> but

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
here though is not the camera itself but

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.440 
here though is not the camera itself but
the<00:02:30.170> software<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:30.980> use<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.459> with<00:02:31.610> again

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the software that I use it with again

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.870 
the software that I use it with again
I've<00:02:33.110> been<00:02:33.140> using<00:02:33.440> Sony<00:02:33.800> cameras<00:02:34.280> clearly<00:02:34.700> one

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
I've been using Sony cameras clearly one

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.640 
I've been using Sony cameras clearly one
I'm<00:02:34.970> recording<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.630> right<00:02:35.840> now<00:02:36.020> for<00:02:36.410> many

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
I'm recording this on right now for many

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.000 
I'm recording this on right now for many
years<00:02:36.950> now<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.580> sony<00:02:38.450> has<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.600> great<00:02:39.590> at<00:02:39.800> least

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
years now and sony has a great at least

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.430 
years now and sony has a great at least
you<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:41.600> sufficient<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.290> least

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
you know I it's sufficient at least

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680 
you know I it's sufficient at least
application<00:02:43.100> called<00:02:43.340> PMB<00:02:43.880> or<00:02:44.150> picture<00:02:44.480> motion

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
application called PMB or picture motion

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.980 
application called PMB or picture motion
browser<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.920> imports<00:02:46.520> video<00:02:46.880> puts<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.930> a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
browser that imports video puts in a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.210 
browser that imports video puts in a
library<00:02:48.440> lets<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.709> easily<00:02:48.830> manage

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
library lets you easily manage

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.340 
library lets you easily manage
everything<00:02:49.670> yeah<00:02:50.570> if<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.750> can't<00:02:50.990> use<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.140> with

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
everything yeah if you can't use it with

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.380 
everything yeah if you can't use it with
this<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.860> comes<00:02:52.040> with<00:02:52.280> something<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.120> guess

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
this it comes with something I guess

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.210 
this it comes with something I guess
I've<00:02:53.750> never<00:02:53.780> seen<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.380> flip<00:02:54.620> share<00:02:54.890> software

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
I've never seen the flip share software

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.400 
I've never seen the flip share software
but<00:02:55.700> I'm<00:02:55.820> assuming<00:02:56.060> it's<00:02:56.390> kind<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.930> equivalent

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
but I'm assuming it's kind of equivalent

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
but I'm assuming it's kind of equivalent
to<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.680> least<00:02:57.980> that's<00:02:58.130> what<00:02:58.280> they<00:02:58.370> were

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
to that least that's what they were

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.840 
to that least that's what they were
going<00:02:58.760> for<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.300> some<00:03:00.050> really<00:03:00.410> basic<00:03:00.950> software

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
going for so some really basic software

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.060 
going for so some really basic software
that<00:03:02.360> comes<00:03:03.080> with<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.769> actually

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
that comes with this and it's actually

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.920 
that comes with this and it's actually
portable<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:05.300> sense<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.810> know<00:03:05.840> you

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
portable in the sense that you know you

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.570 
portable in the sense that you know you
just<00:03:06.170> plug<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:07.220> don't<00:03:07.310> have<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
just plug this in you don't have to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.090 
just plug this in you don't have to
install<00:03:07.790> anything<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.680> sense<00:03:09.890> it's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
install anything so in that sense it's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.400 
install anything so in that sense it's
nice<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.850> as<00:03:11.330> someone<00:03:11.989> that's<00:03:12.140> been

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
nice but and as someone that's been

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.970 
nice but and as someone that's been
using<00:03:12.650> Sony<00:03:13.010> cameras<00:03:13.400> for<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> long<00:03:13.760> time<00:03:14.030> I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
using Sony cameras for a long time I

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.830 
using Sony cameras for a long time I
really<00:03:15.980> am<00:03:16.100> upset<00:03:16.519> about<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.390> can't

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
really am upset about that that I can't

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.350 
really am upset about that that I can't
use<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.500> PMB<00:03:18.980> software<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.970> was

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
use the PMB software with it I was

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.120 
use the PMB software with it I was
actually<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> phone<00:03:21.050> with<00:03:21.260> Sony<00:03:21.890> for

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
actually on the phone with Sony for

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.340 
actually on the phone with Sony for
about<00:03:22.310> three<00:03:22.640> hours<00:03:22.670> on<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.660> day<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.050> I

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
about three hours on the day that I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.070 
about three hours on the day that I
first<00:03:24.590> tried<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.860> use<00:03:25.130> this<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.510> apparently

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
first tried to use this and apparently

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.160 
first tried to use this and apparently
PMB<00:03:27.709> supports<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.730> mp4<00:03:29.420> format<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.989> this

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
PMB supports the mp4 format that this

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.030 
PMB supports the mp4 format that this
requires<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.890> however<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.959> camera<00:03:33.410> says<00:03:33.739> it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
requires it however the camera says it

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.039 
requires it however the camera says it
didn't<00:03:34.370> come<00:03:34.610> with<00:03:34.640> PMD<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.600> came<00:03:35.750> with<00:03:35.900> its

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
didn't come with PMD it came with its

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.560 
didn't come with PMD it came with its
own<00:03:36.140> blog<00:03:36.440> II<00:03:36.470> software<00:03:36.799> won't<00:03:37.670> activate<00:03:38.120> in

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
own blog II software won't activate in

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.720 
own blog II software won't activate in
PMD<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.080> therefore<00:03:39.830> they<00:03:39.980> won't<00:03:40.160> turn

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
PMD and therefore they won't turn

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.930 
PMD and therefore they won't turn
the<00:03:40.879> mp4<00:03:41.420> format<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.250> I'm<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.550> really<00:03:43.849> upset

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the mp4 format so I'm just really upset

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.150 
the mp4 format so I'm just really upset
with<00:03:44.300> Sony<00:03:44.599> about<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:45.379> tried<00:03:45.950> talking

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
with Sony about that I tried talking

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.190 
with Sony about that I tried talking
with<00:03:46.580> them<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.030> getting<00:03:47.180> them<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.480> either

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
with them and getting them to either
