00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.000
 Talking guys on the strings and music 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.270
 we will continue the study of the 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.760
 module through exercise and techniques 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.570
 for the development of learning 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.450
 instrument 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.280
 In this video lesson, I'll teach you. 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.590
 control the pressure of their rights 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.890
 on the land to make a good 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.170
 dynamic execution and take advantage of all 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.170
 the nuances that the instrument makes possible 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.629
 you both an acoustic piano when a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.000
 electronic keyboard 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.850
 The pressure of what I'm talking about is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.350
 dynamics that you will apply with your 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.390
 fingers on the key 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.960
 with this dynamic you will achieve 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.760
 perform each piece and each piece with 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.410
 higher volumes lower volumes 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.930
 in its interpretation is what the own 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.910
 author plays during the play 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.670
 so you can see the difference between 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.850
 play without dynamics or play full force 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.470
 that you have and take advantage of the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.910
 give an interpretation of the song I'll play 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.200
 an excerpt from a song you should 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.380
 to know by ear 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 I'm going to play the part without dynamics now. 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.490
 none too hard 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.280
 and now the same stretch with a dynamic 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.020
 the people 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 This is what happens when you go. 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 to play any song be rock 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.649
 Be bossa nova 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.780
 be a romantic song you have to have 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.299
 have to control the pressure of the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.909
 your fingers on each note is careful 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.350
 if you're going to do a different reception 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.090
 and beautiful 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.090
 electronic keyboards manufactured 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 There is currently a long time they have 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 a range of dynamics ranging from zero to 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.630
 127 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 then within that spectrum you 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.640
 achieves incredible dynamics 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 sometimes not noticeable and other 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 perceptible on the piano there is no 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.930
 electronic technology because it is a 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.569
 Acoustic instrument but you can 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.360
 to notice from a very light 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.459
 pressing the button until the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.650
 earth can you see the dynamics that 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.049
 it's the dynamics that's pressure you have 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.450
 that throw on the note this dynamic 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.850
 There's no way I can go to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.209
 How are you doing in your house? 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.890
 however I will give a small sample of 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.810
 How can this be done? 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.570
 you will notice the movement in your 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.850
 hands down you are putting both the 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.019
 Strength of your arm strength of your hand and 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 regulate it all 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.549
 pay close attention to the strength you are going 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 place your instrument carefully on the 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.209
 amount of force that if it is too 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.180
 after damaging the electronic instrument 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.370
 and can tune the piano out of your home 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.410
 let's make this dynamic test together 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.090
 and any pressure in dollar 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.970
 preferably 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:28.560
 centralized with the minimum of force 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:32.989
 you are able to put it to its minimum 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.989
 me a little more force 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.780
 a little more 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.840
 a little more 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.819
 the maximum amount of strength you can 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:55.870
 a great again 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:58.349
 benz here a little bit more force one 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.349
 little more 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.180
 the maximum force is 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.560
 let's realize the minimum and the maximum looks the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.190
 minimum of force and dynamics very low 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.380
 huh 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.380
 maximum strength and dynamics is 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.710
 This is called note pressure or 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.710
 dynamics
