00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Of course you have seen that movement so 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.269
 strange and good today I'm going to show a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.940
 cube that is a classic this cube does not 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.190
 may be missing in any collection is that 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 I did not know that I did not know that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.789
 cube are you talking about I'm talking about 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.840
 of course rex of course 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.199
 to see it up close 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.480
 you see that cuts so exotic and elegant 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 at the same time some bright colors 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.439
 intense this how I love and how 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 it rotates because it has turns of 120 degrees in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.210
 around the corners eight corners eight 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.730
 turns but it is the same turn always or 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
 be twists of this style and it's already 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.190
 the story ends there is no more a corner 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.640
 another corner that simple simply 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 and with that turn we have three types 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 of pieces the very interesting centers 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 four petals on each face there are and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.070
 then we have twelve edges not the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.489
 typical edges an edge here and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.979
 another edge around here and so 12 and that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.980
 happens or is this game this juice if this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.250
 Cube 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.250
 revolves around the corners but not 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.530
 It has corners as possible 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.810
 corners are depressed do not want 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.370
 receive sunlight 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.560
 that's so clear you have to respect that 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.100
 decision and with this lame you can do 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.010
 the most popular algorithm in the universe is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.720
 the simplest and most powerful algorithm and 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.690
 I'm not overdoing it are simply 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.270
 four movements you see and I've got 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.460
 permute three petal petals over here 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.900
 petal over here petal over there so 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 simple with four movements and 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.130
 really with this algorithm can 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.420
 solve this cube yes yes that clear 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.650
 it is true that you will have to adapt it 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.150
 chicken that I know for example first I do 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.980
 this turn now I do the algorithm and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.650
 then I undo things like this but 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.750
 You see this is so simple simple 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.940
 it even has a certain cut of corners 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.530
 good does not have cuts corners enough 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.440
 good to be a cube has been this 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.300
 style you can have this and now it 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.060
 adapt then it's fine not because like that 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.860
 you can always solve it because then more 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.320
 fast not because it does not end is the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.780
 you turn or leave it like this you start the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.220
 next turn good you know tour very 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.840
 well tour very well has 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.720
 very nice is a nice good bucket 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.550
 cheap and robust in fact this as 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.819
 you can trust you can trust is good 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.590
 I have done 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.170
 well told enough secrets and some 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.579
 pretty strong but good that you 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.760
 you thought here I have prepared a 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.310
 somewhat depressing situation maybe 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.709
 we cry of anguish you see everything solved 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.810
 minus two petals with two petals 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.459
 petals and the rest all resolved as 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.980
 solution to this situation for really 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.010
 you can solve it with the algorithm that 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.739
 I showed before but of course applying it well 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.530
 of course not very interesting I have 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.450
 here as not the octahedron version of 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.159
 rex cube and if this cube is like the cube 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.690
 of c's a little bit more complicated because 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.970
 we have some guidelines that are not 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.920
 present in the cube reid is an octahedron 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.290
 that revolves around faces is worth not 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.150
 we can turn around here of course 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.950
 no but the faces came in I was 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.269
 solving as you see I have no no 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.150
 some pieces he was making a mess 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.700
 the truth but good very interesting for 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.470
 course the cube dino that is like a 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 rex cube but dilated voucher that 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.799
 these lines are widened and 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.769
 transform into a reich cube in fact you 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.989
 if you leave the chus and leave the sun 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.879
 the child cube for a while then 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.739
 at the end these lines dilate and 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.690
 you get a rex cube and I actually like that 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.030
 is how I got this rex cube what happens 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.519
 it does not sound like a real person, well, that's how they are 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.440
 things and if the corners are not 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.180
 cowards like the rex cube that are hidden 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.010
 Well, we have the master 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.599
 you see that the corners here yes that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.209
 they stand out but otherwise it 's like the 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.640
 Rex cube but with exquisite very 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.620
 interesting not super interesting but 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.180
 but please miguel do something useful and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.760
 undo the cube once I'm worth I'll 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.319
 undo it a little bit around here this like 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.690
 It brings me very good memories because it is 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.610
 one of my first cubes 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.130
 I do not know how different game was not 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.540
 used to the 33 44 55 suddenly I 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.400
 I find this cube that is very 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.440
 other than you can not solve as 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.140
 levels neither do centers nor edges do not 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.330
 is another concept and the truth is that I 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.970
 He liked it a lot and is very good see 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.190
 It has enough time and is not perfect 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.570
 that's how the centers are undone 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.400
 you know that they are not fixed in fact you see 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.660
 blue partridge are now here stuck to us 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.730
 they are going around with the 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.550
 petals where the good one has to have 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.810
 careful not of course and one thing 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.280
 curious by the way since we 're 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.750
 talking about centers and things here 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.100
 foreign 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.110
 here we have for example a situation 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.610
 in a cube of rubik 3 x 3 that you know that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.790
 there is no me not like that could never 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.920
 solve the cube then a question 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.390
 I completely disassembled the bucket 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.090
 It took away the edges and corners 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.700
 out and then I add it but I add it to 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.680
 chance not in the determined state is worth I put 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.450
 the edges and the corners as the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.580
 win now is who here another view here 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.110
 but I did not notice the colors and then what 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.020
 tried to solve 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.580
 ok it 's quite likely that it's not 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.080
 able to solve it because it's going to 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.760
 present a situation that does not exist 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.430
 for example tonight and then not what 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.340
 could solve the question is what is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.190
 the probability that riding the cube 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.720
 at random then I can solve it is 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.360
 say can connect with the state 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.280
 resolved I will leave 3 seconds for that 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.680
 should do the calculations very rapidly 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.270
 room 1 2 and 3 I will say the answer and 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.090
 this is very strong this is very strong 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:36.139
 so a twelfth is to say 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.580
 only once in twelve times would it be 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.120
 able to solve it or said another 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.620
 way eleven out of twelve times I could not 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.500
 solve it is worth it because if I would present 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.190
 some situation that I do not control you can 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.030
 do what 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.830
 you can take a cube of rubik 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.389
 dismantle it mount it try 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.580
 solve them repeat those thousands of times 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.590
 and then see if it is indeed a 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.530
 probability of success is a twelfth but 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.770
 good , please leave the scrolls please go 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.360
 mess this cube to see you if you're tired 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.639
 already of the 90 degree turns and they give you 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.620
 disgusting and want to try something new 120 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.080
 degrees of pleasure that has sounded to me 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.820
 well I recommend this bucket is worth very 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.770
 interesting I first solve the 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.110
 edges and then I put the petals and 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.290
 centers that clear and you know that 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.930
 later I'm going to eat buns and 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.330
 some problem we see it once again from 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.220
 excellent excellent close I leave as 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.160
 always a purchase link so that you 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.699
 you buy one two or three incredible 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.340
 incredible a simple game but very very 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.780
 elegant very elegant I like it more than 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.229
 the boy I like more than the master scoop 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.479
 Excellent excellent as a fish is going to 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:45.289
 say goodbye to all of you as always 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.010
 and what happens what happens does not happen anything does not happen 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.130
 nothing 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.130
 see you in another video
