00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
they function so I thought I'd talk

about<00:00:14.849> some<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> ways<00:00:15.360> I've<00:00:15.599> used<00:00:15.900> these

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
about some of the ways I've used these

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.740 
about some of the ways I've used these
different<00:00:17.279> ideas<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.760> past<00:00:18.000> now<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
different ideas in the past now the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.300 
different ideas in the past now the
simplest<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> course<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> game

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
simplest way of course is to have a game

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.920

where<00:00:20.490> you've<00:00:20.580> already<00:00:20.760> got<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.270> player<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
where you've already got one player and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.279 
where you've already got one player and
that's<00:00:22.800> pretty<00:00:23.070> easy<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:24.050> course<00:00:25.050> once

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that's pretty easy to do of course once

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's pretty easy to do of course once
you<00:00:25.380> start<00:00:25.560> getting<00:00:25.619> multiple<00:00:26.099> people

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you start getting multiple people

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
first

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.180 
first
it<00:04:21.750> was<00:04:21.840> probably<00:04:22.020> something<00:04:22.410> tacky<00:04:22.890> like<00:04:23.070> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
it was probably something tacky like you

it was probably something tacky like you
meeting<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.940> because<00:04:24.690> back<00:04:24.870> then<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.260> seemed

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
meeting in because back then that seemed

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.250 
meeting in because back then that seemed
to<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.360> way<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.390> do<00:04:27.660> things<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.140> know

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
to be the way to do things you know
