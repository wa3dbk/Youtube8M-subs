what exactly is rising damp it's the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.410 
what exactly is rising damp it's the

the suction of the ground then wort will

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.830 
the suction of the ground then wort will
rise<00:01:19.159> once<00:01:20.159> rising<00:01:20.580> damp<00:01:20.790> occurs<00:01:21.180> depending
