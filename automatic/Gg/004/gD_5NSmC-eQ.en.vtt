00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.800
 much with mortadella 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.429
 Sicilian defense 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.909

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.789
 the following maps 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.369

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.800
 classic opening 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.220
 this is how the Sicilian defense is set up trafficking 5 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 let's see now 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.190
 coccolotti 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.130

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 d4 change 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.280
 digging for 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.750
 br 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.390

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.490
 e4 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.920
 and now 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.330
 foul city 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.250
 to defend 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.330
 e4 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 where we are in the Sicilian defense 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.670
 labrador photo but if you believe it 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 after he asks the pedestrian to be pushed 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.940
 7 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.450
 a6 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 that still see 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.119
 pure protection program let's say 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.410
 and this push 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.710
 two main functions 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.270
 the first 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.260
 it's the one to prevent 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.390
 nightmare horse jumps 5 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.660
 also m entrance gabfire 11 detachment manifold 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.390
 but most of all 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.720
 for the purpose that also the main one of this torture of these fair of 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.080
 primiero 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.410
 d feed update the e7 thrust 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.410
 e5 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.180
 if there was no such push 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.890
 this year you have to be much more difficult because the horses could 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.119
 go to v5 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.269
 and do a lot of pressure 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.269
 on the weak point of 6 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.489
 tax 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.799
 it is very important 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.419
 now you understand only with the main continuation for the white we see 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.339
 some 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.959
 the first 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 you bishop g5 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.729
 keyboards 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.729
 free place for long castling 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.779
 and at the same time threatened 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 dc create I don't see nature 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.579
 tutorial mounts let this happen to be able to play 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.199
 still with more decision 5 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.379
 and future film 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.769
 f5 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.279
 Traviata I don't think she thinks it's a better day either 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.499
 how is it going away? 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.849
 I prefer to play and if you are 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.279
 in this way 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.849
 solution to your heart, nature 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.829
 and you make space too 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.019
 land 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.459
 get you alfieri me 7 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.419
 so I had seen 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.379
 bishop g5 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.119
 bishop e2 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.119
 bishop 7 sun 22 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.609
 rocco has arrived 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.149
 short attack 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.389
 via colombo 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.999
 kelkoo note that here is belluno 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.999
 worth the light white quickie advantage 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.459
 after for example 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.589
 in exchange 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.479
 white can create 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.290
 some menacing of 6 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.749
 even if it remains 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.749
 engraved horse india c3 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:57.699
 now instead we examine that other almost absent 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.269
 I call my prices 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.269
 I have proposed 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.389
 now not here 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.400
 instead of tar fvg five we now see the continuation with bishop in 22 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 convert to eat 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.189
 quiet motivation that is always deleterious 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.309
 how can he answer now 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.840
 now you can very well respond with you 5 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.419
 because I did not notice the redemption by the group is 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.439
 too dark 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.420
 the horse with nothing left here must go where 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.919
 some recommend i'm f5 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.189
 my marzial I don't sincerely prefer unimesse3 but in f3 the 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.819
 horse blocks the exit of the web 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.319
 pedestrian f2f 4 so the best in my opinion 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.379
 horse p3 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.069
 which also imposes good foundations for morocco I didn't want to get you 3 positioned 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:07.840
 in b1 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.620
 with these the grasshoppers 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.620
 it's really in an iron barrel of salt 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.159
 Now 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.930
 main continuation 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.969
 according to freaks the kal fire e7 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.740
 yes, rocco 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.719
 however the den think 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.899
 that aleeee black satin fur and alfierenero is not really the best of 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.259
 expectations 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.319
 therefore 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.300
 EUR 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.980
 I prefer the second move recommended by the series to later 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:42.439
 bishop 7 that foreign fairs 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.550
 in this way on the 16th a primera place, at home 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.550
 on this point arc 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:51.430
 Now 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.990
 f4 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.659
 looking for 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.259
 create difficulties, because the spaces are receptive 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.370
 nokia c7 and the woman puts herself in a very active position 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.650
 and at the same time claims that you are looking forward to 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.860
 after some changes 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.339
 f5 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.309
 taking away space 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:16.619
 alghero 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.449
 performed by 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.529
 bishops c4 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.179
 which is a very good one and after a while I change them 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.610
 the woman prevents 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.990
 the short castling we have 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.940
 what offers different last sex
