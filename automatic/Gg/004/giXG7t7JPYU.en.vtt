00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.550
 have revealed some new things that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.410
 the truth they have quite credibility and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 if you want to know everything 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
 this in the description of this video them 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 I'm going to leave the link of this forum to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 that you enter and can give 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.860
 account of everything there is for your 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 own eyes in the same way I'm going to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.690
 start saying everything you are going to have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.149
 this new grand theft auto 5 in the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.789
 playstation 4 platform the bar 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 light will flash red and blue when you 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.329
 are following the cops as 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 you can know in playstation 4 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 in control the dual shock then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.070
 just when you need loaded everything 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.109
 this changes between the colors blue and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.030
 red but now when we chase the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.280
 police this is going to become like 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.660
 a kind of siren and this is going to define 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.790
 that the police are following us 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.120
 this is playstation 4 exclusive like 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.920
 several 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.900
 I am going to tell you that as you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.630
 they will know rockstar well they have true 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.280
 contract or has some exclusivity with 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.800
 what the platform of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.260
 playstation also on playstation 4 it 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.180
 you can touch the touchpad to change 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 the modes between first person and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.410
 third person there will be a couple of options 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 to control when and when it is changed 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.200
 back to the third person of the game in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.090
 first person you can have the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.010
 shot will be for the first person 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 but when it fits the third person 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.910
 is when you're in covered mode when 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.850
 you reload you will know that for 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.980
 recharge you simply give r1 r &amp; b and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.390
 the character will recharge then is 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.830
 something that is pretty good when you're 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.510
 as a cover to see the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.490
 enemies because you are simply going to be able to 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.010
 change the third person and that will give you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.510
 a better panorama but to aim for 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.850
 the first mode will always be better 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.370
 person no other thing than he's going to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 have is that version 100 for pc will be 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.800
 compatible with the 4k and the version of 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.650
 playstation 4 and xbox one in versions 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.170
 will work at 1080p with 30 frames 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.880
 This is something that is going to be seen 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.810
 beautiful because honestly like you 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.180
 will know 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.590
 we do not have it at such a high quality and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.510
 in fact you will have seen the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.430
 comparison of graphics and the truth that 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.840
 it is something that is appreciated was going to be super 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.849
 well in the same way I will follow 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.739
 saying some details and now they 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.810
 I'm going to say all the vehicles have 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.819
 had its interiors totally 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.800
 renewed why because now we're going to 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.390
 have the first person mode 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.790
 then all the vehicles have been 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.519
 modified internally to be able to 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.319
 offer better visibility and much 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.989
 better things are going to have because 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.459
 have the first person something else that 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.230
 will have exclusivity with 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.540
 playstation 4 is that calls from 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.569
 police radio will be broadcasted by 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.069
 the speaker of the duel 4 as they see it is 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.780
 something that will be pretty good because 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.819
 is going to give what I know as if it were 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.280
 some kind of flyer all this about that 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.980
 on the screen it will light up and all those 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.110
 things and another thing that you will see is that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.330
 by sliding the touchpad now 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.190
 you will change weapons and stations 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.230
 radio will now know that what 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.700
 we do with a button and we choose them but 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.790
 now we can do it with the panel 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.459
 touch only on playstation 4 saints 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.650
 work is full of different animals 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.989
 those monsters in cvg 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.090
 they discovered the data is not smooth to 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.920
 the bullet tests then as what 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.659
 there are going to be many animals but 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.400
 Anyway, I'm going to make them a 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.170
 video in which I talk about all the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.150
 that you can see and some things that 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.400
 I want to tell you but in this video only 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.010
 I come to tell you the details too 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.530
 there will be thousands of new animations in 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.510
 first person how to load the weapons the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.890
 skydiving and other activities not 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.019
 It can also be like our 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.000
 character smokes a cigar or any 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.340
 thing again more than the truth we're going 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.829
 to need a lot and now the phone 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.260
 it's an object totally in 3d and in the 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.930
 Selfie mode that is to take some 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.060
 elvis is going to look a lot more realistic already 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.470
 that we will see in a first person as 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.239
 if we were holding it in 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.340
 our hand and it will give a touch 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.590
 quite realistic and now also 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.599
 we can create the missions for the first 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.489
 person and that is something that will be 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.379
 quite well let's not assume that we 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.569
 we want to create an activity and works 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.370
 activity we can put it to be only 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.560
 for the first person and all the people 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.419
 will have to use aiming not something that 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.180
 I do not know is that if the aim 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.700
 automatic to apply for the mode 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.350
 first person 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.570
 they will know and we will have the aim 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.510
 automatic but I really do not know and true 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.430
 will allow us only to point or 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.230
 we will have to point us with 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.210
 our sensitivity or this thing is 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.190
 will point in automatic that will be thing of 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.470
 let's go checking later and if 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.850
 some new information comes up 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.370
 just be attentive to the channel and I 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.380
 I'll tell them calmly and another thing that's going 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.690
 to see is there is going to be a new 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.580
 pedestrian talk to see get the 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.350
 100 new songs and shows 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.880
 radio then as they see them 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.470
 characters are going to change something that is 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.870
 something that I think is pretty good 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.420
 and now everyone loves the 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.670
 new weapon is not the electric weapon 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.830
 but now we can see the 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.020
 bullet holes in the bodies 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.060
 these is something much more realistic like this 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.590
 what I hope you liked these are 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.060

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.860
