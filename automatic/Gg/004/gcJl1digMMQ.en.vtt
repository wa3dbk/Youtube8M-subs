00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.230 
yellow guys this is collector Chris um
you<00:00:07.230> know<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> thought<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.340> would<00:00:08.880> make

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
you know I thought that I would make

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.839 
you know I thought that I would make
this<00:00:09.480> video<00:00:09.750> um<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:11.550> something

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
this video um because it's something

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.240 
this video um because it's something
that<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.929> know<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> picked<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.500> over<00:00:13.799> time<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250

ahead and you're going to look at the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760 
ahead and you're going to look at the
creases<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.840> see<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.079> very<00:00:58.410> tight

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
creases here see how they're very tight

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
creases here see how they're very tight
together<00:00:59.899> follows<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.530> tight<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:03.359> know

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
together follows up very tight you know

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.020 
together follows up very tight you know
they're<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> little<00:01:03.840> bit<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.110> spread<00:01:04.619> apart

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030

give it a rub you know rub it good if

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.340 
give it a rub you know rub it good if
you<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.729> dusty<00:01:57.200> rusty<00:01:58.200> stuff<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.490> hands

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
you get dusty rusty stuff on your hands

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
you get dusty rusty stuff on your hands
you<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.979> that's<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you know that that's that's that's a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.789 
you know that that's that's that's a
sign<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.780> newer<00:02:04.020> metal<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
sign that it's a newer metal it's the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.920 
sign that it's a newer metal it's the
oxidation<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.060> natural<00:02:06.509> occurrence

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
oxidation it's it's a natural occurrence

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.660 
oxidation it's it's a natural occurrence
but<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.469> probably<00:02:07.649> newer<00:02:08.099> metal<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.550> it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
but that's probably newer metal if it's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
but that's probably newer metal if it's
rubbing<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.420> hands<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.319> the

rubbing off on your hands you know the
older<00:02:10.709> pieces<00:02:10.890> probably<00:02:11.310> won't<00:02:11.459> rub<00:02:11.640> off<00:02:11.760> as

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
older pieces probably won't rub off as

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.980 
older pieces probably won't rub off as
much<00:02:12.690> on

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
much on

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
much on
as<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.280> gave<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> pretty
