00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.139
 of the competition 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.779
 broke out the key th contest lasted two 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.849
 month and during that time was sent 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.820
 a lot of work 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.240

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.140
 more work 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.189
 all those of course looked 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.630

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.400
 novation than send 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.360
 I don't understand 10 works 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 total will be awarded the contest was only 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.590
 One more and more smart I would be the most 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.460
 bad work most good work 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.130
 which is not sent 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.290
 in this way 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.510
 man will raise the starlings romance was 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.540
 sent a lot of interesting and beautiful 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.980
 of works 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.080
 for example this 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.540
 there was also such a job 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.030
 they are all very beautiful drawing 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.380
 a pencil 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.990
 but I do not understand why to sleep a lot more 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.510
 work here if he sent one job 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 bargain 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 I can tell right away he would have won 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.470
 I'll take another man 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.650
 I won't tell you his name yet 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.380
 show what he did 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.860
 but for now let's see other pictures 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.220
 which I also really liked 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.520
 if i can answer say drawing 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.580
 I can note 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 Here is a picture he did not like 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.690
 very much made all the fashion 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.380
 but definitely like the picture 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 another man grew up 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130
 there were also very nice drawings 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.720
 here is such here do not understand with 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.860
 what did the guests to such a picture 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.660
 create in general it is not even drawing athene 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.370
 open 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.390
 no shame said the man who 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 did it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.140
 these are the drawings 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 Well, it's generally exactly this is exactly nonsense 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.840
 so up to date 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.140
 Of course, itâ€™s not for me to judge the day this rubbish 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.419
 I do not understand what and teach or someone else 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.249
 but still 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.479
 I would lay out such work for the competition 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.319
 didn't become 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.789
 I am me 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.689
 but okay 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.349
 all the work of lotion can see 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.419
 themselves covered VKontakte 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.419
 Especially album for this I long ago 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.199
 created called fans 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.069
 legs laid out working themselves there 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.030
 they will be very interesting if they 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.189
 will be beautiful 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.909
 or just not going to like me 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.559
 put them in a group maybe 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.489
 some of them will get pictures and 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.839
 video and let's move on to the winner 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.089
 it is with us 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.289
 person 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.169
 individual sergey eagles 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.600
 where would he draw 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.400
 your picture to photoshop 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.250
 what do you have stories of the floor forward 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.709
 very difficult so 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.709
 don't say there 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.449
 of course they wrote to the bottom too hard but 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.079
 in photoshop with mouse 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.079
 yes he drew with the mouse to draw even harder 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.029
 and here is his drawing 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.889
 painted 4 hours we will play photoshop 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.419
 I said 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.249
 and higher behind him we would be very 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.290
 not bad 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.409
 I liked this job 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.839
 as I already said 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.769
 But this work is a political scientist daughter 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.029
 beautiful none of them even liked me 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.659
 more than that anonymous drawing 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.159
 a pencil 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.159
 which is easier for you to understand 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.349
 In general, this is all in particular 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.319
