know<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.360> probably<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> stop

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
know what that was for probably to stop

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
know what that was for probably to stop
people<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:52.860> doing<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> didn't<00:00:53.850> work

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
people from doing it but it didn't work

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.880 
people from doing it but it didn't work
as<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.289> fridge<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.829> last

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
as we know this is my fridge from last

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
as we know this is my fridge from last
I'd<00:00:56.340> matter<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.149> doing<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
I'd matter where I was actually doing it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.420 
I'd matter where I was actually doing it
so<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.079> fairly<00:00:58.289> simple<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.800> didn't<00:00:59.070> wait<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so it's fairly simple I didn't wait in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.910 
so it's fairly simple I didn't wait in
orbit<00:00:59.820> while<00:01:00.270> reset<00:01:00.870> happened<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.469> didn't<00:01:01.680> wait

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920

day did all my reset stuff and I just
waited<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> orbit<00:01:10.049> 10<00:01:10.409> minutes<00:01:10.680> before<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
