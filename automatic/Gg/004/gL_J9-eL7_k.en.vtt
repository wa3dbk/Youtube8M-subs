00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
enjoying using it now I do think because

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.630 
enjoying using it now I do think because
the<00:02:38.960> size<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.320> screen<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.650> probably<00:02:40.100> quickly

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
the size of screen is probably quickly

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.780 
the size of screen is probably quickly
just<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.970> type<00:02:41.300> however<00:02:41.900> i<00:02:42.200> do<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:43.280> writing

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
just the type however i do like writing

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.060 
just the type however i do like writing
and<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:44.330> very<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.470> handwriting

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
and it's very that the handwriting

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
and it's very that the handwriting
recognition<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:47.150> fantastic<00:02:48.250> my<00:02:49.250> only<00:02:49.520> slight

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
recognition is fantastic my only slight

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.260 
recognition is fantastic my only slight
gripe<00:02:50.630> with<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.730> because<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.970> size

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
gripe with this is because of the size

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.470 
gripe with this is because of the size
of<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.690> screen<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.800> pen<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.580> little<00:02:56.209> bit

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
of the screen the pen is a little bit

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.410 
of the screen the pen is a little bit
short<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.350> know<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.650> not<00:02:57.739> tiny<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:59.270> the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
short and I know it's not tiny but the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.580 
short and I know it's not tiny but the
problem<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.900> you've<00:03:00.050> got<00:03:00.170> these<00:03:00.260> touch

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.460 
concert as well um last week and maybe
it's<00:04:16.459> because<00:04:16.580> i<00:04:16.790> was<00:04:16.940> quite<00:04:17.420> near<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.110> front

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
it's because i was quite near the front

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.310 
it's because i was quite near the front
i<00:04:18.650> think<00:04:18.830> we<00:04:18.980> were<00:04:19.160> only<00:04:19.310> about<00:04:19.520> four<00:04:20.320> maybe

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
i think we were only about four maybe

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.440 
i think we were only about four maybe
four<00:04:21.739> rows<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.190> most<00:04:22.400> away<00:04:22.730> from<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.030> state<00:04:23.270> it

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
four rows of most away from the state it

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.230 
four rows of most away from the state it
will<00:04:23.570> really<00:04:23.780> fit<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.230> stage<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:25.240> my

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
will really fit this stage and my

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.110 
will really fit this stage and my
recording<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.230> video<00:04:27.350> was<00:04:27.770> fantastic<00:04:28.460> but

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
recording the video was fantastic but

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.690 
recording the video was fantastic but
the<00:04:29.300> mic<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:30.260> couldn't<00:04:30.800> handle<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.460> amount

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
the mic just couldn't handle the amount

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.970 
the mic just couldn't handle the amount
of<00:04:31.850> noise<00:04:32.060> coming<00:04:32.930> from<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.140> speakers<00:04:33.740> so

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
of noise coming from the speakers so

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.860 
of noise coming from the speakers so
realizing<00:04:34.730> that's<00:04:35.000> probably<00:04:35.330> more<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.720> do

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
realizing that's probably more to do

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.340 
realizing that's probably more to do
with<00:04:36.220> like<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.310> limitations<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.510> portable

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
with like the limitations of a portable

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.790 
with like the limitations of a portable
device<00:04:39.380> then<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.190> note<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.640> itself<00:04:41.800> but

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
device then of the note to itself but

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.680 
device then of the note to itself but

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
yeah of course they haven't used it

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.580
