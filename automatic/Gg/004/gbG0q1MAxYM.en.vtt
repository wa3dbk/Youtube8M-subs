00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.110
 Half an onion first in long 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:48.600
 already enough to talk about it so that's what you know 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 Theatrical visit heavy so the little one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.270
 wÃ¶rtchen now you go to the shoots 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.289
 camel and still distributes little mother 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.969
 flakes on the earth not in june 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.969
 sits the whole thing with 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.770
 now there is so much paprika 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.220
 noble so really a lot and then 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.960
 it tastes really cool 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.810
 So neat what we cut yet 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.660
 an onion or muti because 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:52.840
 the other does not tell her one 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:56.580
 quarter under the title you mean 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.580
 just a lot more chili therefore 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.730
 more 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.340
 the paprika to it 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:38.440
 and there we are already exactly that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.440
 whole in an attractive glass top 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.060
 and finished that really looks 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.129
 not so tasty but that tastes good 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.569
 just really good and you have to 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.629
 give it a try because otherwise you can 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.049
 Do not imagine you tasted again 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.049
 that came
