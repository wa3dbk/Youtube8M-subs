 year again this year in october 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 last remember we were at 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.520
 dubai in the united arab emirates 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.379
 so what were we doing there eh 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.620
 well we actually discovered the biggest 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.270
 high tech souk of the world and dubai and in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 october every year the hub 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.980
 technology in fact with 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.570
 thousands of devices that boast that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.370
 snapped up at prices defying any 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.670
 competition and we went to visit this 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.980
 living room 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.090
 that was the jai tex and the jai text 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.770
 chopper ie the part 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 exhibition and then the shopping party 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.930
 it's a real institution there eh 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.930
 well, let's go back 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.490
 and then dubai it's for example seven 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.439
 gigantic towers the biggest of the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.659
 world burj khalifa that we could see in 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.130
 mission impossible 4 for example 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.689
 and then it's here that stands every 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.580
 years so this salon called jaiteh 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.380
 xv to the loggia and eksi is a bit of the c 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 if you want from near east a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.350
 large living room where all the big 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.270
 brands are present and what is 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.939
 interesting is that before the beginning of 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.729
 this text there is the jai shopper text and 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.380
 so here is the tech garlic fair 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.180
 since everyone is coming here for 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.740
 buy high tech products at 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.479
 very interesting prices and yes it's 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.830
 really unique in the world since this 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.690
 living room is open to the general public 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.130
 and we come here really to make 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.799
 business then we buy we buy 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.340
 buy TVs sometimes computers 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.340
 even without thinking 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.840
 we had seen for example a seat of 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.670
 videos we also had a pretty product 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.229
 interesting it was one of the all 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.660
 first hybrid products at a time 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 keyboard and computers and tablets 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.620
 it was hp coming out this stuff because 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.850
 that it does not have other words we do not have 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.890
 found the exact name 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.530
 well it's a seat you are 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.050
 super well installed with more pc 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.600
 alienware hyperpowers so agree 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 it's impressive but 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.200
 you have to be a rich winner for this 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.790
 to afford that because in fact the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.670
 total configuration that is to say the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.920
 seat plus are more computer 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.570
 hyper powerful one is practically at 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.130
 15000 dollars so it will take when 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.480
 even start saving and that's 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.570
 so a hybrid product 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.270
 the x2 a real tablet over 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.670
 10 inches 5 which is fixed on a 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.830
 real mechanical keyboard so that's 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.780
 the hpc of the American is hard 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.250
 is to sion it's a little bit heavy and 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.880
 he has in his stomach this little kz2 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.040
 it's both 100% a computer 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.180
 portable and 100% a tablet and that's 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.590
 a product that is really sinking 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.240
 hp we can separate the keyboard from the screen 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 and when we're on the screen alone we have a 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.190
 tablet running under windows 8 and 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.200
 which offers all the features 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.790
 of a traditional tablet but it's 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.550
 a product that allows users 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.050
 to have total mobility can be 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.120
 used as a traditional computer 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.840
 good taste like a tablet from Nantes 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.910
 will prevail 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.660
 he loves 100% tablets what we see 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.030
 today it's a new 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.849
 generation of products that are a lot 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.980
 more versatile that respond to 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.110
 needs of customers who are mobility 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.290
 I think the nerv will see a lot 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.349
 of products that will be hybrid 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.019
 tablet computers or sometimes the 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.780
 two actually it's a slab with 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.180
 multiple screens that has touchpad 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.830
 that is, it is a touch screen 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.629
 which is usable especially for 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.190
 all that is digital display of which 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.540
 you see behind you the area 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.280
 it's about two meters fifty 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.010
 long on 1 meter fifty in height 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.239
 and in particular we can think of 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.099
 uses in the field of 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.760
 digital signage marketing 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.530
 digital 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.989
 so we are testing this 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.790
 concept with several big brands 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.230
 right now we have some applications 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.599
 you see everyone that there is around 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.950
 after 1,2 playing people 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.630
 are completely attracted completely 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.700
 completely excited by this news 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.410
 the new giant tablet one could 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.120
 almost say it's a product like I 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.979
 tell it coming out of the enchiladas of 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.440
 hp labs it's a prototype 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.729
 is we looking at how we 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.780
 can bring this to the market is this 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.700
 that there is a market for this type of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.900
 product where its share in a market 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.700
 for the general public where it's really 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.800
 reserved for professionals think that 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.810
 the first deal we are going to send will be 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.979
 rather for professional use as and when 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.340
 as the technology goes 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.830
 develop 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.990
 it can be the next generation of 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.050
 game consoles much more scale 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.050
 great
