00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.319 
let's get me give us a little bit of
salt<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.560> what<00:02:57.370> I'm<00:02:57.459> going<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.640> do<00:02:57.760> next<00:02:57.970> is

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
salt and what I'm going to do next is

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.690 
salt and what I'm going to do next is
I'm<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.660> put<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.930> into<00:02:59.200> my<00:02:59.440> little

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
I'm going to put this into my little

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.390 
I'm going to put this into my little
food<00:03:00.700> grinder<00:03:00.970> here<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.629> we'll<00:03:02.440> blend<00:03:03.250> this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
food grinder here and we'll blend this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:33.180 
food grinder here and we'll blend this
up<00:03:05.639> alright<00:03:06.639> so<00:03:06.940> I've<00:03:07.030> got<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.750> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.610 

probably<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.540> right<00:03:34.750> utensil<00:03:35.320> for<00:03:35.470> this

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
probably not the right utensil for this

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.320 
probably not the right utensil for this
but<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.100> certainly<00:03:36.310> served<00:03:36.730> its<00:03:36.940> purpose

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
but it certainly served its purpose

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.410 
but it certainly served its purpose
we'll<00:03:38.290> take<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.650> out<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.070> take<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.430> file<00:03:40.030> shot

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
we'll take this out and take a file shot

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.280 
we'll take this out and take a file shot
of<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:41.640> right<00:03:42.640> there's<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.120> finished<00:03:43.840> product

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
of it right there's the finished product

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.460 
of it right there's the finished product
here<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.240> all<00:03:46.330> mixed<00:03:46.690> up<00:03:46.810> we'll<00:03:47.080> put<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.350> in

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
here and it all mixed up we'll put it in

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.590 
here and it all mixed up we'll put it in
a<00:03:47.650> jar<00:03:47.920> for<00:03:48.220> storage<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.730> course<00:03:49.060> let's<00:03:49.390> just

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
a jar for storage of course let's just

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.840 
a jar for storage of course let's just
give<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.960> a<00:03:49.990> little<00:03:50.190> taste<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:51.460> and<00:03:51.610> see<00:03:51.760> how

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
give it a little taste here and see how

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:00.690 
give it a little taste here and see how
it<00:03:55.980> mmm<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.630> lot<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.780> flavor<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.700> little

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
it mmm a lot of flavor to it a little

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.440 
it mmm a lot of flavor to it a little
bit<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.880> kick

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
bit of kick

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.780 
bit of kick
there's<00:04:02.110> certainly<00:04:02.560> missing<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.310> little<00:04:03.520> bit

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there's certainly missing a little bit

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.060 
there's certainly missing a little bit
of<00:04:04.140> salt<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.380> I'll<00:04:05.500> put<00:04:05.710> a<00:04:05.740> little<00:04:05.860> bit<00:04:05.980> more

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
of salt and I'll put a little bit more

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.720 
of salt and I'll put a little bit more
in<00:04:06.400> there<00:04:06.550> I'll<00:04:06.640> probably<00:04:06.940> have<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.390> total<00:04:07.960> of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
in there I'll probably have a total of

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.970 
in there I'll probably have a total of
about<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> half<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.720> tablespoon<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:14.320> this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
about a half of a tablespoon of this

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.949 
about a half of a tablespoon of this
Himalayan<00:04:15.820> salt<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.299> here<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.940> should<00:04:19.209> not

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
Himalayan salt in here this should not

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.690 
Himalayan salt in here this should not
make<00:04:20.109> it<00:04:20.290> too<00:04:20.470> salty<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.370> wasn't

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
make it too salty but it just wasn't

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.270 
make it too salty but it just wasn't
enough<00:04:21.730> in<00:04:22.120> there<00:04:24.990> let's<00:04:25.990> try<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.290> again<00:04:26.380> here

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.900 

that's<00:04:30.280> perfect

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
that's perfect

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.690 
that's perfect
not<00:04:31.360> too<00:04:31.540> salty<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:32.080> any<00:04:32.260> level<00:04:32.620> no<00:04:33.280> we<00:04:33.430> salt

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
not too salty on any level no we salt

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.150 
not too salty on any level no we salt
this<00:04:33.820> up<00:04:34.060> more<00:04:34.240> if<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.480> want<00:04:34.860> but<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:35.920> think

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
this up more if you want but I think

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.150 
this up more if you want but I think
this<00:04:36.280> will<00:04:36.400> work<00:04:36.580> perfect<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.360> any<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:38.160> your

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
this will work perfect on any of your

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.190 
this will work perfect on any of your
black<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.580> recipes<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.720> easy<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.050> put

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
black and recipes it's easy to put

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.600 
black and recipes it's easy to put
together

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
together

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.830 
together
and<00:04:43.980> like<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.130> give<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.490> try<00:04:45.640> I'm<00:04:46.630> going<00:04:46.780> to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
we'll give this a try on that recipe

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.450 
we'll give this a try on that recipe
