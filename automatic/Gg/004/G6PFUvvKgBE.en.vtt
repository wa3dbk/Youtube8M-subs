00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
holding and there we go a little bit of

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.580 
holding and there we go a little bit of
delay<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.390> small<00:04:03.630> now<00:04:03.840> let's<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:04.470> we

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
delay on the small now let's see if we

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.170 
delay on the small now let's see if we
could<00:04:04.739> get<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.010> block<00:04:05.280> real<00:04:05.579> quick<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.000> kill

okay so let's kill ourselves some derpy

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.010 
okay so let's kill ourselves some derpy
creepers<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:44.910> as<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.180> can<00:04:45.300> see<00:04:45.360> they<00:04:45.690> drop

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
creepers and as you can see they drop

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.200 
creepers and as you can see they drop
bones<00:04:46.440> instead<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.280> gunpowder<00:04:47.760> so<00:04:48.060> that's

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
bones instead of gunpowder so that's

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.580 
bones instead of gunpowder so that's
kind<00:04:48.419> of<00:04:48.539> cool<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.750> know<00:04:48.840> get<00:04:49.080> yourself<00:04:49.200> some

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
kind of cool you know get yourself some

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.339 
kind of cool you know get yourself some
bones<00:04:49.830> for<00:04:50.039> bone<00:04:50.370> meal<00:04:50.610> pretty<00:04:51.360> useful<00:04:51.870> but

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
bones for bone meal pretty useful but

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.320 
bones for bone meal pretty useful but
yeah<00:04:52.470> at<00:04:52.560> least<00:04:52.650> they<00:04:52.770> don't<00:04:52.890> explode<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.909> don't

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
yeah at least they don't explode I don't

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.230 
yeah at least they don't explode I don't
think<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.570> runs<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.900> path

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
think it runs the path

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.610 
think it runs the path
so<00:04:55.330> them<00:04:55.449> like<00:04:55.630> that<00:04:55.840> either<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.440> they're

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
so them like that either so they're

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.559 
so them like that either so they're
pretty<00:04:56.770> easy<00:04:56.949> to<00:04:57.220> take<00:04:57.370> on<00:04:57.639> better<00:04:58.210> than<00:04:58.449> your

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
pretty easy to take on better than your

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.930 
pretty easy to take on better than your
regular<00:04:58.690> creepers<00:04:59.319> and<00:04:59.560> the<00:05:00.130> last<00:05:00.340> mod<00:05:00.669> that

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
regular creepers and the last mod that

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.510 
regular creepers and the last mod that
we<00:05:01.060> have<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.810> dirt<00:05:02.020> Dom<00:05:02.350> B<00:05:02.560> just<00:05:03.190> to<00:05:03.220> kill

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
we have is the dirt Dom B just to kill

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.059 
we have is the dirt Dom B just to kill
him<00:05:03.669> he<00:05:04.360> will<00:05:04.539> give<00:05:04.720> us<00:05:04.900> bread<00:05:05.289> so<00:05:05.590> he's<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.770> lot

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
him he will give us bread so he's a lot

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.740 
him he will give us bread so he's a lot
more<00:05:06.310> useful<00:05:06.639> than<00:05:07.120> your<00:05:07.270> regular<00:05:07.389> zombies

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
more useful than your regular zombies

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.150 
more useful than your regular zombies
and<00:05:08.110> somebody<00:05:08.349> giving<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.620> rotten<00:05:08.919> flesh

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
and somebody giving you rotten flesh

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400 
and somebody giving you rotten flesh
will<00:05:09.400> actually<00:05:09.729> get<00:05:09.880> something<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.360> can<00:05:10.410> rely

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
will actually get something you can rely

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.080 
will actually get something you can rely
