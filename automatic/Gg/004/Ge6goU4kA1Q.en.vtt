went on his way
and<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.529> came<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.070> later<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.460> ride<00:00:29.670> it

and I came a little bit later to ride it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.269 
and I came a little bit later to ride it
and<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.359> couldn't<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.900> us<00:00:30.990> started<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.099> was

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
and I couldn't get us started and I was

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.889 
and I couldn't get us started and I was
at<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.820> ages<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.690> kind<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
at this for ages and I was kind of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
at this for ages and I was kind of
feeling<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.320> maybe<00:00:35.190> I'd<00:00:35.430> been<00:00:35.610> taken<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
feeling like maybe I'd been taken and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
feeling like maybe I'd been taken and
then<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.630> finally<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> hang<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.530> using<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
then I finally got the hang of using the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.369 
then I finally got the hang of using the
primer<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:39.899> running<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
primer to get the thing running so I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.690 
primer to get the thing running so I
thought<00:00:40.649> I'd<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> video<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> save<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> some

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
thought I'd do a video and save you some

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
thought I'd do a video and save you some
of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> frustration<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.540> had<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of the frustration that I had now this

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.170 
of the frustration that I had now this
is<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> perfect<00:00:44.160> day<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> video<00:00:45.059> on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
is a perfect day to do a video on

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
is a perfect day to do a video on
starting<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.809> sled<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.399> last<00:00:47.399> night<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
starting this sled because last night it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.900 
starting this sled because last night it
went<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.180> minus<00:00:48.750> 32<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.640> today

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
went down to minus 32 so I think today

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.170 
went down to minus 32 so I think today
we're<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.210> doing<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.539> -<00:00:52.399> 28<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.760> really

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
we're up doing what - 28 but it's really

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
we're up doing what - 28 but it's really
cold<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> started<00:00:55.469> today

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
cold so if we can get it started today

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.599 
cold so if we can get it started today
we<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> start<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.090> top<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:59.250> never<00:00:59.399> over

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
we can get a start on top you never over

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
we can get a start on top you never over
when<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.239> cold<00:01:00.510> anything<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.469> any

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
when it's this cold anything with any

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.200 
when it's this cold anything with any
moisture<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.039> who's<00:01:02.250> gonna<00:01:02.340> freeze<00:01:02.699> solid<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
moisture on who's gonna freeze solid so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.240 
moisture on who's gonna freeze solid so
that<00:01:03.619> includes<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> cable<00:01:05.070> from<00:01:05.189> your

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that includes the cable from your

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
that includes the cable from your
throttle<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.060> before<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.540> start<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.869> slide

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
throttle so before you start your slide

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
throttle so before you start your slide
is<00:01:07.110> always<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> good<00:01:07.650> idea<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.189> move<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is always a good idea just to move it a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.649 
is always a good idea just to move it a
couple<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> times<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> make<00:01:09.240> sure<00:01:09.360> they'll<00:01:09.510> get

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
couple of times to make sure they'll get

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
couple of times to make sure they'll get
back<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.140> its<00:01:11.100> original<00:01:11.610> position<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.479> then

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
back to its original position and then

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
back to its original position and then
when<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> start<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.280> not

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
when you start it you know it's not

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
when you start it you know it's not
gonna<00:01:14.549> stick<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.900> off<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.439> basic

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
is up thank you manual for how many

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840 
is up thank you manual for how many
times<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.110> operate<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> primer<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.610> sled

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
times to operate the primer on this sled

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.450 
times to operate the primer on this sled
it's<00:01:36.030> three<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.320> three<00:01:37.500> full<00:01:37.920> Prime's<00:01:40.130> okay<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's three so three full Prime's okay so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.429 
it's three so three full Prime's okay so
when<00:01:41.610> an<00:01:41.700> engine<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> cold<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.750> needs<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.020> richer

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
when an engine is cold it needs a richer

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.749 
when an engine is cold it needs a richer
mixture<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.610> running

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
mixture to start then when it's running

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
mixture to start then when it's running
at<00:01:45.420> operating<00:01:45.780> temperature<00:01:45.899> they're<00:01:46.409> two

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
at operating temperature they're two

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
at operating temperature they're two
ways<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> choke<00:01:47.670> ok<00:01:48.630> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
ways to do that one is a choke ok I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.330 
ways to do that one is a choke ok I
choked<00:01:48.960> does<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.350> by<00:01:49.500> restricting<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.130> air

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
choked does that by restricting the air

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
choked does that by restricting the air
flow<00:01:50.579> into<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> carburetor<00:01:51.210> right<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
flow into the carburetor right so you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.580 
flow into the carburetor right so you
have<00:01:52.380> lower<00:01:53.130> air<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.299> fuel<00:01:54.479> mixture<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.470> other

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
have lower air to fuel mixture the other

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.929 
have lower air to fuel mixture the other
way<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.799> using<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> primer<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.640> actually

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
way is using a primer that's actually

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730 
way is using a primer that's actually
putting<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.540> gasoline<00:01:58.110> into<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
putting more gasoline into the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.389 
putting more gasoline into the
carburetor<00:01:59.450> so

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
carburetor so

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.880 
carburetor so
I'll<00:02:02.119> show<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> little<00:02:02.570> trick<00:02:02.929> once<00:02:03.710> I

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
I'll show you a little trick once I

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.529 
I'll show you a little trick once I
learned<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.310> saved<00:02:04.520> me<00:02:04.609> a<00:02:04.640> lot<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.969> frustration

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
learned it saved me a lot of frustration

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.149 
learned it saved me a lot of frustration
these<00:02:05.719> are<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.200> fuel<00:02:06.409> lines<00:02:06.649> you'll<00:02:06.829> see<00:02:06.979> that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
these are the fuel lines you'll see that

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.949 
these are the fuel lines you'll see that
we<00:02:07.250> go<00:02:07.369> from<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.670> primer<00:02:07.939> down<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
we go from the primer down to the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.509 
we go from the primer down to the
carburetor<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.830> they<00:02:09.979> shoot<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.369> bit

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
carburetor and they shoot a little bit

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.540 
carburetor and they shoot a little bit
of<00:02:10.580> gas<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.379> so<00:02:12.379> we're<00:02:12.800> gonna<00:02:12.860> turn<00:02:13.160> our<00:02:13.340> fuel

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
of gas in so we're gonna turn our fuel

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.910 
of gas in so we're gonna turn our fuel
line<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:14.620> now

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
line on now

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.890 
line on now
this<00:02:16.580> led<00:02:16.819> when<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.120> cold<00:02:17.390> needs<00:02:17.690> about

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
this led when it's cold needs about

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.949 
this led when it's cold needs about
three<00:02:18.230> Prime's<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.610> started<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
three Prime's to get it started but the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.720 
three Prime's to get it started but the
three<00:02:21.200> Prime's<00:02:21.470> need<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:21.920> after<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.489> fuel

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
three Prime's need to be after this fuel

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.910 
three Prime's need to be after this fuel
line<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.090> full<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.290> there's<00:02:24.440> two<00:02:24.530> ways<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.799> can

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
line is full so there's two ways you can

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.350 
line is full so there's two ways you can
tell<00:02:25.040> one<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.549> just<00:02:25.670> tell<00:02:25.879> by<00:02:25.910> feel

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
tell one is you can just tell by feel

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
tell one is you can just tell by feel
there's<00:02:27.319> not<00:02:27.470> as<00:02:27.620> much<00:02:27.769> resistance<00:02:28.160> when<00:02:28.489> this

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
there's not as much resistance when this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.820 
there's not as much resistance when this
fuel<00:02:28.819> line<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.120> empty<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.989> what<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.379> finally

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
fuel line is empty but what I finally

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.500 
fuel line is empty but what I finally
did<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.670> helped<00:02:31.849> me<00:02:31.970> again<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.209> hang<00:02:32.360> up

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
did that just helped me again to hang up

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.390 
did that just helped me again to hang up
as<00:02:32.629> I<00:02:32.750> open<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:32.989> hood<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.950> watched<00:02:34.190> this

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
as I open the hood and I watched this

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.520 
as I open the hood and I watched this
fuel<00:02:34.670> line<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.239> as<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.599> moved<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.440> primer<00:02:38.530> and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
fuel line here as I moved the primer and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.900 
fuel line here as I moved the primer and
you<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.769> see<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.069> field<00:02:40.310> going<00:02:40.519> through<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
you can see the field going through the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.660 
you can see the field going through the
lines<00:02:41.120> there

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
lines there

00:02:42.670 --> 00:03:19.710 
lines there
now<00:02:43.670> it's<00:02:43.849> full

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.960 

okay<00:03:20.720> there<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.350> go<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.890> other<00:03:21.950> thing<00:03:22.310> to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
okay there you go the other thing to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.540 
okay there you go the other thing to
keep<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.300> mind<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.720> once<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.950> snowmobile<00:03:25.430> is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
keep in mind is once the snowmobile is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.160 
keep in mind is once the snowmobile is
warmed<00:03:25.850> up<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.120> it's<00:03:26.240> up<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.450> temperature

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
warmed up and it's up to temperature

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.200 
warmed up and it's up to temperature
don't<00:03:27.590> prime<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.130> when<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.640> go<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.790> start<00:03:29.120> it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
don't prime it when you go to start it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.970 
don't prime it when you go to start it
again<00:03:29.900> actually<00:03:30.320> even<00:03:30.410> if<00:03:30.530> there's<00:03:30.710> nobody

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
else it's for a little while you didn't

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:40.960 
else it's for a little while you didn't
need<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.420> primer<00:03:39.580> Bank<00:03:40.580> is<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.850> do

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
need the primer Bank is if you do

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.760 
need the primer Bank is if you do
private<00:03:41.150> when<00:03:41.480> it's<00:03:41.600> warm<00:03:41.840> then<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.500> putting

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
private when it's warm then you putting

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.140 
private when it's warm then you putting
too<00:03:42.860> much<00:03:43.070> gas<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.490> you're<00:03:43.670> gonna<00:03:43.760> flood<00:03:44.000> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
too much gas in you're gonna flood the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.080 
too much gas in you're gonna flood the
engine<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:46.040> that's<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.310> whole<00:03:46.430> other<00:03:46.700> kind<00:03:46.970> of

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.210 
engine and that's a whole other kind of
fun<00:03:47.270> I<00:03:47.840> did<00:03:48.080> another<00:03:48.260> video<00:03:48.440> about<00:03:48.710> starting<00:03:49.130> a

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
fun I did another video about starting a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.850 
fun I did another video about starting a
flooded<00:03:49.820> engine<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.650> hopefully<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.740> found

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
flooded engine so hopefully you found

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.260 
flooded engine so hopefully you found
