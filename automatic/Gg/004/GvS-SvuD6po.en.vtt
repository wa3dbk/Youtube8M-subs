that's that might happen today most
likely<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.619> won't<00:01:42.830> because<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.300> vast<00:01:44.479> amount

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
likely you won't because the vast amount

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.290 
likely you won't because the vast amount
of<00:01:44.900> water<00:01:45.140> were<00:01:45.320> putting<00:01:45.650> in<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.910> basement

submerged in water so investigators

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.100 
submerged in water so investigators

the case here

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.650 
the case here
but<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.220> completely<00:02:34.400> engulfed<00:02:35.150> from<00:02:35.390> again

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660

but it is completely engulfed from again
the<00:02:35.780> basement<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.380> up<00:02:36.560> through<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.890> roof

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the basement right up through the roof

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.090 
the basement right up through the roof
still<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> very<00:02:38.480> active<00:02:38.630> scene<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.800> probably

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
still a very active scene it's probably

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.320 
still a very active scene it's probably
going<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.250> be<00:02:40.310> several<00:02:40.910> hours<00:02:41.209> before

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
going to be several hours before

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.000 
going to be several hours before
firefighters<00:02:41.750> can<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.350> inside<00:02:42.709> to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
firefighters can get inside to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.970 
firefighters can get inside to
completely<00:02:43.670> extinguish<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.650> know<00:02:45.740> main

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
completely extinguish it you know main

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.199 
completely extinguish it you know main
concern<00:02:46.310> right<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.850> keep<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.120> from

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
concern right now is to keep it from

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.330 
concern right now is to keep it from
spreading<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.810> extinguish<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.010> most

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
spreading to extinguish it and most

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.070 
spreading to extinguish it and most
importantly<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:50.000> do<00:02:50.120> an<00:02:50.209> accountability<00:02:50.630> to

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
importantly to do an accountability to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.130 
importantly to do an accountability to
make<00:02:51.260> sure<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:51.710> everyone
