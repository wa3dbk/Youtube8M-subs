00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
stage of any game and I felt we should

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.389 
stage of any game and I felt we should
have<00:00:34.350> been<00:00:34.469> three<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:34.739> fall<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.130> love<00:00:35.250> we

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
should have been out of sight and that's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.670 
should have been out of sight and that's
the<00:00:37.950> thing<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.370> were<00:00:38.460> rooting<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.940> sure

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
the thing that we were rooting I'm sure

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.830 
the thing that we were rooting I'm sure
still<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:41.610> two<00:00:41.850> goals<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.570> your

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
still about their two goals all your

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
still about their two goals all your
faults<00:00:43.170> will<00:00:43.290> disappoint<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.399> both<00:00:44.520> goals

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
faults will disappoint with both goals

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.510 
faults will disappoint with both goals

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and one's a free-kick and it's just one

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.709 
and one's a free-kick and it's just one
of<00:00:47.550> those<00:00:47.640> things<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.030> football<00:00:48.300> units<00:00:48.539> got<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
of those things in football units got to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.029 
of those things in football units got to
head<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> clear<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.350> went<00:00:49.559> straight<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
head it clear we went straight to the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.650 
head it clear we went straight to the
camps<00:00:50.340> arms<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.730> that's<00:00:50.879> football<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.480> found

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
camps arms but that's football we found

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.040 
camps arms but that's football we found
anything<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.370> that's<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.460> unlucky

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
anything about that that's an unlucky

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.360 
anything about that that's an unlucky
thing<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.379> happen<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.039> course<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thing that can happen and of course that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
thing that can happen and of course that
gave<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.090> belief<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.870> then

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
gave them a bit of belief and and then

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.299 
gave them a bit of belief and and then
the<00:00:58.140> second<00:00:58.469> goal<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:58.980> should<00:00:59.129> stop

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the second goal but we should stop

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.049 
the second goal but we should stop
across<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:01.469> we've<00:01:02.280> conceded<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.789> part<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
across and we've conceded back part of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.429 
across and we've conceded back part of
so<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> disappointing<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.290> two

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
so that's the disappointing the two

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.859 
so that's the disappointing the two
goals<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> can't<00:01:06.270> pick<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.689> those

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
goals but you know I can't pick on those

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.240 
goals but you know I can't pick on those
negatives<00:01:07.350> why<00:01:07.500> pick<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> negatives

but they together win a cable cord keep

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.860 
but they together win a cable cord keep
ahead<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.340> making<00:02:03.729> three<00:02:04.180> or<00:02:04.240> four<00:02:04.390> sites<00:02:04.630> as

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
ahead of making three or four sites as

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.070 
ahead of making three or four sites as
well<00:02:05.020> yeah<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:06.250> was<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.490> close<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.900> done<00:02:07.900> better

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
well yeah it was it close to done better

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.240 
well yeah it was it close to done better
I<00:02:08.260> think<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.619> could<00:02:08.710> have<00:02:08.830> done<00:02:08.920> better<00:02:09.070> i

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I think we could have done better i

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.469 
I think we could have done better i
think<00:02:09.550> from<00:02:09.640> our<00:02:09.760> perspective<00:02:09.820> year<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
think from our perspective year the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.240 
think from our perspective year the
goalkeepers<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.080> right<00:02:11.230> place<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:11.830> i

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
goalkeepers in the right place but i

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.220 
goalkeepers in the right place but i
think<00:02:12.940> was<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> couple<00:02:13.690> times<00:02:13.840> i<00:02:13.959> can<00:02:14.110> just

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
think was a couple times i can just

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.960 
think was a couple times i can just
think<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.470> our<00:02:14.590> first<00:02:14.740> touch<00:02:15.010> not<00:02:15.310> quite<00:02:15.670> being

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
think of our first touch not quite being

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.820 
think of our first touch not quite being
taken<00:02:16.780> us<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.020> centre<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> goal<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
taken us to the centre of the goal to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.560 
taken us to the centre of the goal to
make<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.070> finishes<00:02:18.370> easier<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:19.420> things

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
make the finishes easier little things

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.120 
make the finishes easier little things
like<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.810> we've<00:02:20.620> got<00:02:20.740> some<00:02:20.890> very<00:02:20.920> good

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
like that we've got some very good

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.120 
like that we've got some very good
finishes<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.640> football<00:02:21.910> club<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.980> glad

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
finishes of the football club I'm glad

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.860 
finishes of the football club I'm glad

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
you know the goal is so it's unlike us

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.320

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
but you know that's stuff to work on

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.240 
but you know that's stuff to work on
what<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.170> say<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.410> them<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.620> half<00:02:29.800> time<00:02:30.100> off

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
for a first off like that or we will

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.990 
for a first off like that or we will
watch<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.620> 11<00:02:32.920> callers<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.790> ten

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
watch you have 11 callers to one in ten

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.030 
watch you have 11 callers to one in ten
shots<00:02:34.269> turn<00:02:34.480> arm<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.930> stuff<00:02:35.110> like<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.320> well

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
shots turn arm and stuff like that well

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.940 
shots turn arm and stuff like that well
the<00:02:36.280> focus<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.030> very<00:02:37.060> much<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.480> maintain<00:02:37.950> how

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the focus is very much to maintain how

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920 
the focus is very much to maintain how
will<00:02:39.130> we<00:02:39.160> played<00:02:39.820> could<00:02:40.150> be<00:02:40.239> felt<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.570> we<00:02:40.690> hit

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
will we played could be felt if we hit

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.729 
will we played could be felt if we hit
those<00:02:41.080> levels<00:02:41.470> again<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.800> would<00:02:41.890> win<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.160> game

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
those levels again we would win the game

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.960 
those levels again we would win the game
to<00:02:44.739> make<00:02:44.920> sure<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.280> player<00:02:45.519> can<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.880> an

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
to make sure the player can have an

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.910 
to make sure the player can have an
adverse<00:02:46.090> reaction<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.930> break<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.650> I

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
adverse reaction to the break and I

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.650 
adverse reaction to the break and I
don't<00:02:48.070> think<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.370> did<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:49.090> kicked<00:02:49.510> off

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
don't think we did that we kicked off

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.509 
don't think we did that we kicked off
and<00:02:49.959> we<00:02:50.260> scored<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> goal<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.100> thinking

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
and we scored the goal and you thinking

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.000 
and we scored the goal and you thinking
great<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.690> players<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:55.620> not<00:02:56.620> drop<00:02:56.860> them

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
great the players of not drop them

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.259 
great the players of not drop them
intensity<00:02:57.489> levels<00:02:57.760> because<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.000> thought<00:02:58.150> we

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
intensity levels because I thought we

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.990 
intensity levels because I thought we
worked<00:02:58.420> extremely<00:02:58.750> hard<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.730> think<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.790> first

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
worked extremely hard I think the first

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.759 
worked extremely hard I think the first
goal<00:03:01.239> just<00:03:01.540> changes<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.019> complexion<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
goal just changes the complexion of the

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:03.960 
goal just changes the complexion of the
game<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.070> although<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:03.310> chased<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.850> game

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
game and although we chased the game

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.910 
game and although we chased the game
well<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.180> thought<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.870> late<00:03:05.380> stage<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.680> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
well I thought that late stage of the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.830 
well I thought that late stage of the
game<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.390> wasn't<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.690> be<00:03:09.600> sublime<00:03:10.600> on

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
game it just wasn't to be sublime on

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140 
game it just wasn't to be sublime on
adam<00:03:11.170> smith<00:03:11.470> tonight<00:03:11.680> book<00:03:12.250> brought<00:03:12.760> him<00:03:12.970> in

for Simon Francis's right hamstring you

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.479 
for Simon Francis's right hamstring you
so<00:03:16.480> many<00:03:16.720> pivotal<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.650> goal<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.100> useful

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
so many pivotal in that goal that useful

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.400 
so many pivotal in that goal that useful

yeah it's very
I<00:03:20.440> mean<00:03:21.960> compliment<00:03:22.960> around<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.290> won't<00:03:23.410> be

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
I mean compliment around it won't be
