across<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.949> whole<00:00:20.070> country<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:21.529> it's<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
across the whole country and it's a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.870 
across the whole country and it's a
little<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.580> mad<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:25.369> I've<00:00:26.369> got<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.760> go

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
little bit mad out there I've got to go

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.400 
little bit mad out there I've got to go
and<00:00:27.029> check<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> polytunnel<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> make

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
and check the polytunnel just to make

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.900 
and check the polytunnel just to make
sure<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> hasn't<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> load<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> snow<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
sure it hasn't got a load of snow on it

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
sure it hasn't got a load of snow on it
obviously<00:00:30.269> if<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> has<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> off

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
obviously if it has I need to get it off

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
obviously if it has I need to get it off
as<00:00:32.430> quickly<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.969> can

as quickly as I can

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.830 
as quickly as I can
this<00:00:35.190> literally<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.090> fell<00:00:36.360> overnight

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this literally is what fell overnight

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.310

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and it's it's rather deep so I'm going

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
and it's it's rather deep so I'm going
to<00:00:43.379> drive<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.739> everywhere<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> 5

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to drive around everywhere to the 5

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.240 
to drive around everywhere to the 5
miles<00:00:45.149> an<00:00:45.329> hour<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.690> 3rd<00:00:45.930> gear<00:00:46.289> 10<00:00:46.890> miles<00:00:47.100> an

miles an hour in 3rd gear 10 miles an
hour<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:48.379> pushing<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> boat<00:00:49.620> out

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
hour if I'm really pushing the boat out

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.160 
hour if I'm really pushing the boat out
I'm<00:00:51.030> hoping<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.750> onto<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> main

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I'm hoping what to get onto the main

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.660 
I'm hoping what to get onto the main
road<00:00:52.199> who<00:00:52.800> should<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.160> should<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.850> fine<00:00:54.149> now

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
road who should be should be fine now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
road who should be should be fine now

and<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:59.640> started<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> allotment

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and get started on the allotment

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.450 
and get started on the allotment
I<00:01:01.140> bought<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.829> obviously<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> weather's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I bought it obviously the weather's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.870 
I bought it obviously the weather's
against<00:01:02.730> me<00:01:02.940> today<00:01:03.140> but<00:01:04.140> I've<00:01:04.799> also<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
against me today but I've also got the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.370 
against me today but I've also got the
the<00:01:06.180> coal<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.600> contend<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.110> low<00:01:07.229> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

the coal to contend it was low it's
extremely<00:01:08.159> cold<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> moment<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
extremely cold at the moment so I think

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420 
extremely cold at the moment so I think
I'm<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> sit<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.340> my

I'm just gonna have to kind of sit on my

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.270 
I'm just gonna have to kind of sit on my
hands<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> wait<00:01:12.119> until<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> slightly<00:01:14.040> better

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
hands and wait until the slightly better

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
hands and wait until the slightly better
way<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.049> honest<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.350> don't

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
way to get here to be honest I don't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
way to get here to be honest I don't
really<00:01:16.950> need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> hit<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> ground<00:01:17.880> running

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
really need to hit the ground running

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.649 
really need to hit the ground running
until<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.630> sort<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> early<00:01:19.439> March<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.659> we're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

until all sort of early March and we're
only<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
only in

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.289 
only in
Micke<00:01:23.659> January<00:01:24.080> at<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.170> moment<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:25.150> it's<00:01:26.150> not

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
Micke January at the moment so it's not

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.620 
Micke January at the moment so it's not
too<00:01:26.479> much<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.810> panic<00:01:29.950> now<00:01:30.950> I'm<00:01:31.130> I'm<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.240> sure

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
too much of a panic now I'm I'm not sure

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.550 
too much of a panic now I'm I'm not sure
what<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.979> expect<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:35.360> far<00:01:35.509> as<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.990> polytunnel

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
what to expect as far as the polytunnel

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.060 
what to expect as far as the polytunnel
goes<00:01:37.630> whether<00:01:38.630> or<00:01:39.020> not<00:01:39.170> all<00:01:39.440> done<00:01:39.740> wanna<00:01:39.860> touch

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
goes whether or not all done wanna touch

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.770 
goes whether or not all done wanna touch
the<00:01:40.220> brakes<00:01:41.200> whether<00:01:42.200> or<00:01:42.409> not<00:01:43.570> there's<00:01:44.570> snow

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
the brakes whether or not there's snow

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.910 
the brakes whether or not there's snow
on<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.020> because<00:01:45.200> obviously<00:01:45.289> with<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.710> being<00:01:45.860> a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
on it because obviously with it being a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.499 
on it because obviously with it being a
poly<00:01:46.100> ton<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.520> gonna<00:01:46.610> be<00:01:46.759> slightly<00:01:46.970> warmer

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
poly ton it's gonna be slightly warmer

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.800 
poly ton it's gonna be slightly warmer
inside<00:01:48.080> than<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.490> outside<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.299> I'm<00:01:50.420> hoping

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
inside than the outside so I'm hoping

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.570 
inside than the outside so I'm hoping
the<00:01:50.930> snow<00:01:51.430> won't<00:01:52.430> settle<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:54.399> as<00:01:55.399> you<00:01:55.490> can

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
the snow won't settle on it as you can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.370 
the snow won't settle on it as you can
see<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.850> snow<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.119> still<00:01:56.509> falling<00:01:56.569> I<00:01:57.200> think

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
see the snow is still falling I think

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.510 
see the snow is still falling I think
there's<00:01:57.530> more<00:01:57.679> snow<00:01:58.069> forecast<00:01:59.080> so<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.520> don't

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
there's more snow forecast so I don't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.550 
there's more snow forecast so I don't
know<00:02:01.789> how<00:02:02.300> bad<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.659> weather's<00:02:02.990> gonna<00:02:03.140> get<00:02:03.380> or

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
know how bad this weather's gonna get or

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.109 
know how bad this weather's gonna get or
whether<00:02:03.740> we've<00:02:04.039> kind<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.520> got<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.759> worst<00:02:04.940> of

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
whether we've kind of got the worst of

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.650 
whether we've kind of got the worst of
it<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:06.550> kind<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.610> like<00:02:07.670> weather<00:02:08.239> like<00:02:08.479> this

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
it now I kind of like weather like this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.359 
it now I kind of like weather like this
when<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.929> can<00:02:09.050> get<00:02:09.170> out<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.619> film<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.220> and

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
when you can get out and film it and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.490 
when you can get out and film it and
look<00:02:10.519> at<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.910> everything<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.500> obviously

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
look at it and everything but obviously

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.750 
look at it and everything but obviously
when<00:02:12.709> you're<00:02:17.920> trying<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.010> use<00:02:19.130> engine<00:02:19.459> braking

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
when you're trying to use engine braking

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.510 
when you're trying to use engine braking
instead<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.360> touching<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.780> brakes

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.830 

yeah<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:24.880> nice<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.390> able<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.570> go<00:02:25.690> out

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
yeah it's nice to be able to go out

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.210 
yeah it's nice to be able to go out
there<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.260> look<00:02:26.350> at<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.650> stuff<00:02:26.920> but

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
there and look at this stuff but

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.430 
there and look at this stuff but
obviously<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:28.390> these<00:02:28.990> kinds<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.320> conditions

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
obviously in these kinds of conditions

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.340 
obviously in these kinds of conditions
you<00:02:30.070> really<00:02:30.880> don't<00:02:31.030> want<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.210> be<00:02:31.300> going<00:02:31.450> out<00:02:31.660> I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
you really don't want to be going out I

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.170 
you really don't want to be going out I
mean<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.220> certainly<00:02:33.400> couldn't<00:02:33.700> get<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
mean I certainly couldn't get out in the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.630 
mean I certainly couldn't get out in the
countryside<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.560> know<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.160> really<00:02:36.400> get<00:02:36.580> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
countryside you know we can really get a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180 
countryside you know we can really get a
good<00:02:36.700> look<00:02:36.940> at<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.180> snow<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.010> roads

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
good look at the snow and so the roads

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.110 
good look at the snow and so the roads
have<00:02:39.370> all<00:02:39.520> been<00:02:39.670> thoroughly<00:02:39.970> gritted<00:02:42.120> right

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
have all been thoroughly gritted right

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.970 
have all been thoroughly gritted right
and<00:02:43.360> as<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:43.960> can<00:02:44.320> see<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.560> from<00:02:44.650> here

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
and as I can see it from here

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.610 
and as I can see it from here
the<00:02:45.250> polytunnel<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:46.030> clean<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:46.900> fine<00:02:47.230> that's

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the polytunnel is clean it's fine that's

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.440 
the polytunnel is clean it's fine that's
great<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.670> don't<00:02:48.820> even<00:02:48.940> need<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> go<00:02:49.300> in

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
great so I don't even need to go in

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.630 
great so I don't even need to go in
there<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.680> if<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.280> probably<00:02:51.520> won't

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
there and if you can you probably won't

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.740 
there and if you can you probably won't
be<00:02:51.730> out<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.880> see<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.210> this<00:02:52.300> camera<00:02:52.540> but

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
be out to see that in this camera but

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.570 
be out to see that in this camera but
yeah<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.320> it's<00:02:53.560> got<00:02:53.770> is<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.130> very<00:02:54.340> very

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
yeah all it's got is just a very very

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.370 
yeah all it's got is just a very very
light<00:02:54.820> dusting<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.390> snow<00:02:55.540> in<00:02:55.900> some<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
light dusting of snow in some of the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.200 
light dusting of snow in some of the
little<00:02:56.800> creases<00:02:57.220> where<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.820> bit<00:02:57.970> creased

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
little creases where it's a bit creased

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.000 
little creases where it's a bit creased
up<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:59.590> think<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:01.510> fine<00:03:02.320> although<00:03:02.680> maybe<00:03:02.860> I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
up I think it's fine although maybe I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.850 
up I think it's fine although maybe I
should<00:03:03.220> go<00:03:03.310> another<00:03:03.490> look<00:03:04.710> now<00:03:05.710> I<00:03:05.740> think

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
should go another look now I think

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.540 
should go another look now I think
that's<00:03:06.130> fine

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
that's fine

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.140 
that's fine
Noby<00:03:06.700> right<00:03:06.970> that's<00:03:07.900> nowhere<00:03:08.530> near<00:03:08.890> as<00:03:09.150> deep

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
Noby right that's nowhere near as deep

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.810 
Noby right that's nowhere near as deep
as<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.600> here<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:11.410> yeah<00:03:12.130> it's<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.460> a<00:03:12.610> little

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
as it is here so yeah it's just a little

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.370 
as it is here so yeah it's just a little
dusting<00:03:13.210> it's<00:03:13.390> got<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> think<00:03:13.990> they'll<00:03:14.260> be

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
dusting it's got so I think they'll be

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.290 
dusting it's got so I think they'll be
fine

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
fine

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.080 
fine
brilliant<00:03:16.300> okay<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.920> that's<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.280> sorted

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.630 

obviously<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> bit<00:03:23.230> bit<00:03:23.980> nerve-racking

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
obviously it's a bit bit nerve-racking

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.610 
obviously it's a bit bit nerve-racking
driving<00:03:25.000> around<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.360> Maynooth<00:03:25.660> maneuver<00:03:26.319> on

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
driving around in Maynooth maneuver on

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.620 
driving around in Maynooth maneuver on
this<00:03:26.800> sort<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.220> ice<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.060> these<00:03:28.660> conditions

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
this sort of ice and these conditions

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.809 
this sort of ice and these conditions
but<00:03:31.630> ultimately<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.590> my<00:03:32.770> little<00:03:33.250> workhorse

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
but ultimately it is my little workhorse

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.070 
but ultimately it is my little workhorse
so<00:03:34.120> I've<00:03:34.240> just<00:03:34.270> kind<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.630> got<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:34.959> on<00:03:35.050> with

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
so I've just kind of got to get on with

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.390 
so I've just kind of got to get on with
it<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:36.430> what<00:03:36.459> got<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.850> do

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.320 

right<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.840> roads<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.319> go

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.330 

it's<00:03:48.330> not<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.599> bad

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.010 

Oh<00:03:55.599> God<00:03:56.630> 20<00:03:57.170> miles<00:03:57.319> an<00:03:57.500> hour

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.620 

so<00:04:02.650> there<00:04:02.980> we<00:04:03.100> go<00:04:03.130> that's<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.760> Rick<00:04:04.030> weld<00:04:04.330> at<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
so there we go that's a Rick weld at the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.960 
so there we go that's a Rick weld at the
moment<00:04:04.960> this<00:04:05.110> rather<00:04:05.740> snowy<00:04:06.490> winter

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
moment this rather snowy winter

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.030 
moment this rather snowy winter
wonderland<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.530> said<00:04:08.680> I'm<00:04:08.740> not<00:04:08.800> sure<00:04:08.950> how

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
wonderland like I said I'm not sure how

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.080 
wonderland like I said I'm not sure how
long<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:09.340> gonna<00:04:09.430> last

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
long it's gonna last

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.230 
long it's gonna last
obviously<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.100> well<00:04:12.100> it's<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:13.000> can't

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
obviously I well it's like this I can't

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.670 
obviously I well it's like this I can't
really<00:04:13.390> get<00:04:13.630> out<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.930> about<00:04:14.020> well<00:04:14.410> there<00:04:14.500> was

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
really get out and about well there was

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.290 
really get out and about well there was
I<00:04:14.890> wasn't<00:04:15.100> planning<00:04:15.370> on<00:04:15.700> going<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.060> having<00:04:16.180> a

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
I wasn't planning on going and having a
