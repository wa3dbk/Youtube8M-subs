Nokia's new PureView technology comes
into<00:01:34.479> play<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:35.290> phone<00:01:35.530> uses<00:01:35.770> all<00:01:36.070> those<00:01:36.220> extra

into play the phone uses all those extra

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.240 
into play the phone uses all those extra
pixels<00:01:37.119> for<00:01:37.479> over<00:01:37.780> sampling<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.409> combines

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
pixels for over sampling and combines

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.280 
pixels for over sampling and combines
them<00:01:39.399> into<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.759> very<00:01:40.060> sharp<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.720> clean<00:01:40.930> image

them into a very sharp and clean image

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.710 
them into a very sharp and clean image
it<00:01:42.220> also<00:01:42.520> means<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.000> 808<00:01:43.509> can

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
it also means that the 808 can

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.810 
it also means that the 808 can
effectively<00:01:44.200> emulate<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:45.009> lossless<00:01:45.310> three

effectively emulate a lossless three
times<00:01:46.060> optical<00:01:46.270> zoom<00:01:46.540> because<00:01:47.350> it<00:01:47.469> simply<00:01:47.950> has

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
times optical zoom because it simply has

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.300 
times optical zoom because it simply has
so<00:01:48.399> many<00:01:48.549> pixels<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.360> sensor

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so many pixels on the sensor

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.920 
so many pixels on the sensor
alternatively<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:52.000> change<00:01:52.270> resolutions

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
alternatively you can change resolutions

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.200 
alternatively you can change resolutions
and<00:01:53.140> use<00:01:53.320> up<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.740> thirty<00:01:54.040> eight<00:01:54.310> megapixels<00:01:55.060> at
