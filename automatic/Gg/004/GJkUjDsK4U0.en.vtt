00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
half this way i guess i don't know that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.870 
half this way i guess i don't know that
matters<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.190> i'm<00:02:23.730> actually

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880

matters or not but and i'm actually
scared<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.600> because<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.290> to

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
scared to do this because it's going to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.960 
scared to do this because it's going to
be<00:02:25.500> juicy<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.070> then<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:26.460> go<00:02:26.490> all<00:02:26.670> over<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
be juicy and then they go all over the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.120 
be juicy and then they go all over the
place<00:02:31.160> yeah<00:02:32.160> juice<00:02:32.670> coming<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.440> ok<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
place yeah juice coming out ok and it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.370 
place yeah juice coming out ok and it
looks<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.550> murdered<00:02:35.940> somebody<00:02:36.120> okay<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.350> I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
looks like I murdered somebody okay so I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.690 
looks like I murdered somebody okay so I
guess<00:02:37.710> what<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.580> two<00:02:38.880> halves<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
guess what you have with two halves and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:50.000 
guess what you have with two halves and
need<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.730> wipe<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.340> okay<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.980> next

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
need to wipe this do so okay so the next

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.850 
need to wipe this do so okay so the next
step<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:51.450> put<00:02:52.160> one<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.310> halves<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:55.560> top

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
step is to put one of the halves on top

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.130 
step is to put one of the halves on top
of<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.160> guy<00:02:56.510> face<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.150> says<00:03:00.330> firmly
