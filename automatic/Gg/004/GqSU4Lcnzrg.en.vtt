00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello again to everyone just as 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.839
 indicates in the video where we gave 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.750
 solution to a tank with loss of 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.520
 water let's see now how to solve 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.430
 the problem of an input mechanism 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.310
 this one that you have here that is blocked 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.110
 because of the lime we will do it in a way 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 very simple and very economic you will see that 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.760
 only spending a few cents or 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.520
 we even have to change the piece the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 We can leave in perfect condition 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.359
 if you have seen the video before 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.910
 which showed how to solve the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.860
 problem of the discharge mechanism 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.989
 you already know how to get to this point 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.600
 in which we find ourselves in case we 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.660
 you have not seen it I leave the link below and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.940
 so you can see it once the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.239
 water inlet stopcock and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.380
 having emptied deposit totally what 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.000
 what we now have to do is remove 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.500
 all the water that is below you see that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.400
 there is still water down, nothing 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.430
 we take a sponge 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.470
 a cloth that soaks well and what we have 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 what to do is to remove all the water that 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.030
 there inside 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.950
 taking it out and we can throw it out 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.040
 so until we have everything 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.570
 absolutely dry well once we 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.580
 we have ensured that we no longer have 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.110
 no water in the tank as 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.450
 we can calmly dismantle the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.490
 water input mechanism so we 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.610
 We make sure that when we remove it, 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.229
 No water is left on the ground, although 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.830
 every way I recommend that you have 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.860
 by hand a scrubbing bucket and a mop 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.110
 in case there is still some water to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.670
 clean it quickly and easily what 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.350
 we have to do now is to dismantle the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.789
 mechanism to disassemble the mechanism 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.070
 we have in the bottom right 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.460
 under the mechanism where the water enters 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.050
 two nuts one that is the sleeve or 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.450
 the tube that is the supply of 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.009
 water and another the nut that holds the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.640
 same mechanism so with a key 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.240
 English we will access these nuts that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.890
 we have below 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 and remember to loosen by pushing towards 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.789
 in front of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 clockwise 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.410
 to the right and to tighten the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.300
 back to oneself to the left 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.350
 well, nothing, we're going to remove the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.920
 nuts and disassemble the mechanism 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.170
 we have disassembled the doors now 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.100
 what we have to do is take out the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.190
 mechanism easily as you can see 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.500
 it's full of lime on all sides 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.690
 and that's what makes sometimes not 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.150
 between the water in the tank that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.530
 is blocked by what we have to 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.840
 do now with this is what we did 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.690
 if you remember with the mechanism of 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.840
 download give you a good cleaning only 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.280
 a detail that when you do not know this 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.530
 you will see that you have left the rubber of the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.560
 black tip down or sometimes it stays 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.520
 hooked on the same mechanism or which 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.530
 touch it because it messes bad thing leaves 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.290
 the hands completely black like this 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.810
 take it carefully and the bar right away 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.780
 with clean water because if not dirty 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.300
 everything that sounds good because we take 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.490
 now the mechanism we are looking for a 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 container in which the mechanism we 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.680
 fit reasonably well 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 I have found this and what we have 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.070
 what to do next then it is with 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.080
 vinegar that a little bottle of these 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.380
 vinegar does not reach even 50 cents what 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.050
 ok we filled the container with vinegar and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.910
 we leave it for a while until you see 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.190
 who has eaten the vinegar all the lime 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.190
 and it would have been clean if it was not in 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.080
 the container in the container 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.490
 mechanism so you leave it for a while in a 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.320
 side then you turn to another 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.000
 until but everything has to be fine 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.310
 soaked dominate for a long time 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.260
 so that it stays completely clean 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 so that 's what I'm going to do now 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.970
 I'm going to open the bottle of vinegar and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.920
 I will leave everything well filled after 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.650
 a couple of hours as you see I've been 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.120
 turning to and fro 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.150
 so that vinegars are now well soaked 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.340
 has been completely clean with this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.520
 we already make sure once it has fallen 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.320
 all the waste all the lime that had the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.480
 water inlet system mechanism 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.560
 Well, we can say that it will not give us 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.390
 no problem 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.680
 a couple of reminders is well appointment 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.660
 what do you see here 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.539
 It has the shape for flat screwdriver 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.190
 its usefulness is to regulate the entry of 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.889
 water we can adjust the buoy so that 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.500
 rise or lower more and more water will enter 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.479
 in our warehouse now at the time of 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.610
 mount it a very important reminder 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.030
 Do not forget to put the board of 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.000
 black rubber this rubber gasket serves to 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.650
 that the water does not escape and there is no more 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.639
 much more to do we put in your 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.639
 due place 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.719
 the water inlet mechanism already 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.870
 then we put the thread underneath 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:58.339
 and we will also tighten the cuff 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.800
 Water supply water inlet 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:02.990
 for placement of the lid and 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.210
 buttons or refer to the video that you 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.979
 I mentioned before and nothing else I hope that 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.800
 these explanations have served you 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.210
 to have it repaired properly you have the key 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.219
 in passing we check that there is no 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.279
 flight of any kind that you have been 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.110
 simple economic repair if it has 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.759
 liked and it has been practical for you to leave 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.009
 I like it and also your 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.729
 comments until another next video 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.729
 goodbye friends
