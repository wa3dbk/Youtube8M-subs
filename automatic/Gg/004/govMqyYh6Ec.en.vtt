00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
it horizontally along there and I'm

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.800 
it horizontally along there and I'm
holding<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:41.759> other<00:03:42.759> half<00:03:43.090> that's<00:03:43.299> peeled<00:03:43.569> off

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
holding the other half that's peeled off

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.649 
holding the other half that's peeled off
along<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.199> back<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.829> here<00:03:45.519> we<00:03:45.609> go<00:03:45.639> I'm<00:03:46.449> going

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
along the back so here we go I'm going

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.869 
along the back so here we go I'm going
to<00:03:46.720> line<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.169> up<00:03:47.229> see<00:03:48.129> how<00:03:48.220> well<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.459> can<00:03:48.579> do

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
to line that up see how well I can do

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.199 
to line that up see how well I can do
this<00:03:49.079> because<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.470> don't<00:03:50.739> really<00:03:50.829> like<00:03:51.209> dry

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
this because I don't really like dry

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.330 
this because I don't really like dry
installations<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.049> be<00:03:53.169> fair<00:03:53.409> because<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.099> wet

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
installations to be fair because a wet

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.360 
installations to be fair because a wet
ones<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.699> can<00:03:54.849> at<00:03:55.329> least<00:03:55.359> easily<00:03:56.250> move<00:03:57.250> it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
ones you can at least easily move it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:07.059 
ones you can at least easily move it
around<00:03:57.459> while<00:03:57.849> it's<00:03:57.969> wet

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.720 

I<00:04:07.129> think<00:04:07.879> I've<00:04:08.090> got<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.769> so<00:04:09.769> I'm<00:04:10.249> just<00:04:10.430> going<00:04:10.640> to

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
I think I've got it so I'm just going to

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.690 
I think I've got it so I'm just going to
use<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.450> squeegee<00:04:11.870> as<00:04:12.349> I've<00:04:13.010> still<00:04:13.280> got<00:04:13.430> half

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
use the squeegee as I've still got half

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.560 
use the squeegee as I've still got half
of<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:13.909> still<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.850> work<00:04:20.030> out<00:04:20.269> some<00:04:20.299> of

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
of it still on just to work out some of

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.570 
of it still on just to work out some of
the<00:04:20.840> bubbles<00:04:21.289> on<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.680> one<00:04:21.859> side<00:04:26.289> okay<00:04:27.289> so

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the bubbles on the one side okay so

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.650 
the bubbles on the one side okay so
essentially<00:04:28.580> all<00:04:28.729> i'm<00:04:28.849> doing<00:04:28.910> is<00:04:29.180> peel<00:04:29.509> off

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
essentially all i'm doing is peel off

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.279 
essentially all i'm doing is peel off
the<00:04:29.690> other<00:04:29.960> side<00:04:31.360> there<00:04:32.360> we<00:04:32.479> go<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:33.050> just

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
the other side there we go that just

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.980 
the other side there we go that just
peels<00:04:33.530> off<00:04:33.849> so<00:04:35.380> just<00:04:36.380> using<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.830> squeegee<00:04:37.990> get

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
peels off so just using the squeegee get

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.540 
peels off so just using the squeegee get
out<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.530> bubbles<00:04:39.830> are<00:04:39.949> left<00:04:40.250> in<00:04:40.400> there

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
out the the bubbles are left in there

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.990 
out the the bubbles are left in there
don't<00:04:41.449> worry<00:04:41.599> about<00:04:41.780> pressing<00:04:42.199> too<00:04:42.380> hard

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
don't worry about pressing too hard

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.939 
don't worry about pressing too hard
that's<00:04:44.000> why<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.270> made<00:04:44.419> out<00:04:44.599> of<00:04:44.630> rubber

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
that's why it's made out of rubber

00:04:44.949 --> 00:05:05.760 
that's why it's made out of rubber
you're<00:04:45.949> not<00:04:46.070> doing<00:04:46.250> any<00:04:46.400> damage<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.789> it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.080 

all<00:05:06.770> right<00:05:06.889> that's<00:05:07.010> as<00:05:07.250> best<00:05:07.490> as<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.729> can<00:05:07.790> get<00:05:08.030> it

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
all right that's as best as I can get it

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.610 
all right that's as best as I can get it
and<00:05:08.300> you<00:05:08.360> can<00:05:08.750> see<00:05:08.870> I've<00:05:08.960> still<00:05:09.169> got<00:05:09.290> the<00:05:09.380> front

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
and you can see I've still got the front

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.950 
and you can see I've still got the front
tab<00:05:10.220> still<00:05:10.520> on<00:05:10.669> there<00:05:10.850> so<00:05:11.090> I'll<00:05:11.389> just<00:05:11.570> peel

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
tab still on there so I'll just peel

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.010 
tab still on there so I'll just peel
that<00:05:12.110> off<00:05:16.090> just<00:05:17.090> leave<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.510> away<00:05:17.780> for<00:05:17.960> a
