00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
use alleged virus for this game because
I<00:01:40.799> didn't<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> chance<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.119> case

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I didn't really have a chance to in case

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
I didn't really have a chance to in case
you<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.689> he<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.979> he

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you if he was going to go off then he

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.530 
you if he was going to go off then he
would<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> play<00:01:44.759> food<00:01:45.000> maxx<00:01:45.180> c<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.479> i

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
would have to play food maxx c so i

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.850 
would have to play food maxx c so i
think<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> fact<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.049> i<00:01:46.170> sided<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.680> allergic

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
think the fact that i sided in allergic

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
think the fact that i sided in allergic
virus<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.579> Maxie<00:01:48.119> probably<00:01:48.869> wasn't<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> good

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
virus and Maxie probably wasn't a good

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990 
virus and Maxie probably wasn't a good
idea<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.220> never<00:01:50.340> anything<00:01:50.700> worth

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
idea because it was never anything worth

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
idea because it was never anything worth
taking<00:01:51.090> because<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.560> really<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> wait

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
taking because you really have to wait

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
taking because you really have to wait
for<00:01:53.189> brewery<00:01:53.610> Bureau<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.860> make

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
for brewery Bureau so then you can make

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.090 
for brewery Bureau so then you can make
a<00:01:55.890> jackass<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> dragon<00:01:57.119> ruler<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
a jackass out with a dragon ruler so I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010 
a jackass out with a dragon ruler so I
saw<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.909> 10<00:02:00.090> knew<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.540> tried<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.840> play

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
through his back row I wasn't too sure

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
through his back row I wasn't too sure
what<00:02:02.820> he<00:02:02.909> had<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> knew<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.350> whatever

it<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.340> was<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> stop<00:02:05.909> something<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it was it was going to stop something so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.430 
it was it was going to stop something so
i<00:02:07.590> make<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.399> drunk<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.239> sec<00:02:09.420> any<00:02:09.629> black<00:02:10.050> corn<00:02:10.289> of

charger

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
charger

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.580 
charger
so<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.610> was<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.850> whatever<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.050> he<00:02:16.260> does

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so I was like whatever so he does

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.960 
so I was like whatever so he does
tornadoes<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.160> Emma<00:02:17.310> steez<00:02:17.550> basically

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
tornadoes and Emma steez basically

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.820 
tornadoes and Emma steez basically
clears<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.360> path<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> book<00:02:19.320> could<00:02:19.410> move<00:02:19.620> my

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
clears the path so I book could move my

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.100 
clears the path so I book could move my
my<00:02:20.190> monster<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.750> prevent

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
my monster just to you know prevent

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.790 
my monster just to you know prevent
taking<00:02:22.440> damage<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.950> guess<00:02:23.990> mkay<00:02:24.990> tues<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.740> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
taking damage I guess mkay tues and I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.170 
taking damage I guess mkay tues and I
Maxie<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.460> probably<00:02:26.670> shouldn't<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.090> done

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
Maxie I probably shouldn't have done

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.610 
Maxie I probably shouldn't have done
that<00:02:27.360> because<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.810> should<00:02:27.990> let<00:02:28.200> him<00:02:28.320> go<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
that because I should let him go off a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.560 
that because I should let him go off a
bit<00:02:28.860> more<00:02:28.980> because<00:02:29.790> he<00:02:30.000> might<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.240> still<00:02:30.420> to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
bit more because he might have still to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.900 
bit more because he might have still to
stun<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.900> flavor<00:02:31.140> gardless<00:02:31.560> he<00:02:32.520> drew<00:02:32.700> into
