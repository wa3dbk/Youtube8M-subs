 while waiting opened the box with another 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.090
 hand on the right and found just such 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.790
 piece we 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.540
 It is written that it is made by hand, that is 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.940

 good apple 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:52.730
 but not to say that as much as ice 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.709
 probably blow all the same heat transfer more precisely 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.250
 cold recoil higher 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.629
 but acceptable in general and provided that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.959
 they don't really melt away anything 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:10.650

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.660
 you if you more than once colic 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.590
