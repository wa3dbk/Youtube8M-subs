tried<00:01:27.299> doing<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.659> earlier<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.350> character

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890

air smashing into the ground and all
around<00:01:58.200> him<00:01:58.409> they'll<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.619> popping<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.280> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
around him they'll be popping up you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.590

ground before they pop up in an area
this<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> best<00:02:03.420> times<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
this is one of the best times to go and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.200 
this is one of the best times to go and
get<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> few<00:02:04.590> hits<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> him<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.060> can

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
get a few hits in on him because you can

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.999 
get a few hits in on him because you can
usually<00:02:06.329> run<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.840> before<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.350> attack<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.770> over

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
usually run in before the attack is over

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.749 
usually run in before the attack is over
because<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.520> where<00:02:08.640> they're

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
because you can see where they're

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.479 
because you can see where they're
popping<00:02:09.060> up<00:02:09.179> third<00:02:10.080> attack<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.890> pretty<00:02:11.160> easy

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
popping up third attack is pretty easy

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.150 
popping up third attack is pretty easy

last attack will be he will have four

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.770 
last attack will be he will have four
fireballs<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.610> air<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.360> easiest<00:02:37.630> way

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
fireballs in the air and the easiest way

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.120 
fireballs in the air and the easiest way
to<00:02:37.810> dodge<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.710> first<00:02:38.770> one

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
to dodge this is when that first one

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.160 
to dodge this is when that first one
comes<00:02:39.340> at<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:39.610> just<00:02:39.820> keep<00:02:39.970> running<00:02:40.150> then<00:02:40.750> two

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
comes at you just keep running then two

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.170 
comes at you just keep running then two
of<00:02:41.320> them<00:02:41.440> will<00:02:41.620> fire<00:02:41.770> at<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.010> same<00:02:42.160> time<00:02:42.460> roll

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
of them will fire at the same time roll

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.580 
of them will fire at the same time roll
dodge<00:02:43.420> out<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> way<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:44.020> those<00:02:44.170> two<00:02:44.410> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
dodge out of the way of those two and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.170 
dodge out of the way of those two and
then<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.070> fourth<00:02:45.310> one<00:02:45.370> will<00:02:45.580> be<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:45.850> close

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
then the fourth one will be really close

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.490 
then the fourth one will be really close
by<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.480> time<00:02:46.690> you're<00:02:46.840> done<00:02:47.020> with<00:02:47.080> your<00:02:47.290> roll
