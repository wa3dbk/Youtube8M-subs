00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
because you very cleverly devised the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.890 
because you very cleverly devised the
plan<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.760> how<00:02:37.940> we're<00:02:38.000> going<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.390> go<00:02:38.630> under

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
plan of how we're going to go under

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.860

worshipping no no you fooled us because

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.310 
worshipping no no you fooled us because
we<00:02:48.260> took<00:02:48.530> literally<00:02:49.239> another<00:02:50.239> model<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
we took literally another model the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.830 
we took literally another model the
point<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.459> had<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.640> very<00:02:52.910> clear<00:02:53.209> intention

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
point is you had a very clear intention

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.620 
point is you had a very clear intention
you<00:02:54.590> thought<00:02:54.920> about<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.970> plotted<00:02:56.420> how

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
you thought about and you plotted how

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.540 
you thought about and you plotted how
you<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.200> get<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.310> knew

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
you are going to get it and you knew

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.910 
you are going to get it and you knew
that<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:59.000> literal<00:02:59.420> way<00:02:59.630> you<00:03:00.440> mean<00:03:00.650> shopping

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
that the literal way you mean shopping

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.180 
that the literal way you mean shopping
this<00:03:01.820> way<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.330> not<00:03:02.480> going<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.750> work<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.290> you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
this way is not going to work so you

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.000 
this way is not going to work so you
have<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.519> devise<00:03:04.880> another<00:03:05.030> plan<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:06.590> plan<00:03:06.800> was

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
have to devise another plan the plan was

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.040

blah<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:29.370> know<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.850> end<00:03:30.030> product<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.500> know

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
blah we know the end product and we know

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.350 
blah we know the end product and we know
the<00:03:31.860> way<00:03:32.010> how<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:32.610> get<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:32.970> okay

the way how you have to get there okay

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.520 
the way how you have to get there okay
take<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> lot<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.890> end<00:03:35.100> product<00:03:35.520> is<00:03:35.670> clear

so the point is whenever you have
anything<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.600> do<00:03:39.690> with<00:03:39.720> body<00:03:39.930> language<00:03:40.080> you

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
have a very clear thought process on how

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.160 
have a very clear thought process on how
to<00:03:42.570> achieve<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:43.020> I<00:03:43.350> art<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:45.060> decides<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.140> want

with that after of course you can make

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
with that after of course you can make
different<00:03:52.680> decisions<00:03:52.800> as<00:03:53.220> well<00:03:53.520> during<00:03:53.820> the
