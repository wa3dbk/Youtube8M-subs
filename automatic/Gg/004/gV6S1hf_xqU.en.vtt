00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
all right so we want you to tell us why

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.860 
all right so we want you to tell us why
there<00:00:06.590> are<00:00:06.650> two<00:00:06.800> sphinxes<00:00:07.600> one<00:00:08.600> in<00:00:08.720> the

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
there are two sphinxes one in the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.000 
there are two sphinxes one in the
beginning<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:09.469> a<00:00:09.559> big<00:00:09.830> one<00:00:10.010> here<00:00:10.570> so<00:00:11.570> um<00:00:12.020> so

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
beginning and a big one here so um so

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.029 
beginning and a big one here so um so
originally<00:00:13.459> when<00:00:14.030> you<00:00:14.379> when<00:00:15.379> we<00:00:15.500> first<00:00:15.650> SPECT

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
originally when you when we first SPECT

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.840 
originally when you when we first SPECT
out<00:00:16.219> the<00:00:16.460> Egypt<00:00:17.390> area<00:00:17.750> it<00:00:17.990> was<00:00:18.110> actually<00:00:18.850> once

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
out the Egypt area it was actually once

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.019 
out the Egypt area it was actually once
you<00:00:19.970> put<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.420> pieces<00:00:21.039> into<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.070> obelisk<00:00:22.490> the

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
you put the pieces into the obelisk the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.370 
you put the pieces into the obelisk the
doors<00:00:23.240> open<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.689> it<00:00:23.779> literally<00:00:24.349> just

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
doors open and it literally just

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.579 
doors open and it literally just
revealed<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.250> room<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:26.060> had<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.449> ski<00:00:27.320> on<00:00:27.439> in

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
revealed a room that had the ski on in

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.710 
revealed a room that had the ski on in
it<00:00:27.710> but<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.189> was<00:00:28.580> really<00:00:28.759> disappointed<00:00:28.970> with

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
it but I was really disappointed with

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.350 
it but I was really disappointed with
the<00:00:30.019> way<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.589> Sphinx<00:00:31.339> had<00:00:31.609> looked<00:00:31.789> so

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
the way that the Sphinx had looked so

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.000 
the way that the Sphinx had looked so
edgy<00:00:33.079> on<00:00:33.790> one<00:00:34.790> weekend<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.660> came<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:36.500> built

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
edgy on one weekend I came in and built

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.729 
edgy on one weekend I came in and built
like<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:37.670> largest<00:00:38.090> Sphinx<00:00:38.840> I<00:00:38.989> could<00:00:39.260> possibly

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
like the largest Sphinx I could possibly

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.220 
like the largest Sphinx I could possibly
build<00:00:40.570> and<00:00:42.039> it<00:00:43.039> was<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:44.090> was<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.780> cool-looking

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
build and it was it was so cool-looking

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.490 
build and it was it was so cool-looking
basically<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.219> just<00:00:46.850> added<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:48.109> added<00:00:48.260> it

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
basically we just added this we added it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.160 
basically we just added this we added it
in<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.129> turned<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:49.670> into<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.420> Badger<00:00:50.690> final

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
in and turned it into the Badger final

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.479 
in and turned it into the Badger final
part<00:00:51.379> of<00:00:51.590> their<00:00:51.829> of<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.239> Egypt<00:00:53.539> area<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.489> part

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
part of their of the Egypt area and part

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.270 
part of their of the Egypt area and part
of<00:00:55.670> what<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.120> think<00:00:56.809> what<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.679> liked<00:00:57.980> about<00:00:58.100> it

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
of what I think what I liked about it

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.729 
of what I think what I liked about it
was<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:59.719> was<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.989> way<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:00.350> approached

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
was it was the way that you approached

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.970 
was it was the way that you approached
it<00:01:00.980> because<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:02.059> would<00:01:02.210> be<00:01:02.300> very<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:02.780> guess<00:01:03.289> the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
it because it would be very I guess the

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.290 
it because it would be very I guess the
obvious<00:01:04.280> thing<00:01:04.460> would<00:01:04.550> be<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.940> approach

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
obvious thing would be that you approach

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.330 
obvious thing would be that you approach
it<00:01:05.330> from<00:01:05.720> an<00:01:05.780> angle<00:01:05.930> whereby<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.830> can<00:01:07.100> sort<00:01:07.310> of

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
it from an angle whereby you can sort of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.040 
it from an angle whereby you can sort of
see<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.670> from<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.940> front<00:01:07.970> or<00:01:08.390> see<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:08.900> from

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
see it from the front or see it from

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.410 
see it from the front or see it from
below<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.860> get<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.460> really<00:01:10.700> good<00:01:10.910> sense<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
below and get a really good sense of the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.940 
below and get a really good sense of the
scale<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.200> wanted<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.770> actually

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
scale of it but I wanted to actually

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.480 
scale of it but I wanted to actually
come<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.030> onto<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.010> didn't

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
come up onto it so that you didn't

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.160 
come up onto it so that you didn't
understand<00:01:16.910> what<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.090> were<00:01:17.300> standing<00:01:17.690> on<00:01:17.840> so

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
understand what you were standing on so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.040 
understand what you were standing on so
that<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:19.100> kind<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.730> took<00:01:20.090> your<00:01:20.420> mind<00:01:20.780> a

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
that you you kind of it took your mind a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.720 
that you you kind of it took your mind a
while<00:01:21.260> as<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.860> walked<00:01:22.070> around<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.580> to

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
while as you walked around it to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.390 
while as you walked around it to
appreciate<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:23.810> what<00:01:24.740> you're<00:01:24.890> actually<00:01:25.130> that

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
appreciate so what you're actually that

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.770 
appreciate so what you're actually that
you're<00:01:25.520> actually<00:01:25.670> standing<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.600> of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
you're actually standing on the back of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.070 
you're actually standing on the back of
the<00:01:26.870> Sphinx<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.880> got<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.420> moment<00:01:29.960> would

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
the Sphinx so you got that moment would

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.530 
the Sphinx so you got that moment would
happen<00:01:30.500> when<00:01:30.760> essentially<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:31.970> hidden<00:01:32.180> it's

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
happen when essentially it's hidden it's

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.810 
happen when essentially it's hidden it's
hidden<00:01:32.930> from<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.770> its<00:01:34.010> scale<00:01:34.130> and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
hidden from you because of its scale and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.660 
hidden from you because of its scale and
the<00:01:35.360> fog

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.940 

so<00:01:42.670> after<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.000> model<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.570> gigantic<00:01:44.050> Sphinx<00:01:44.710> I

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
so after a model this gigantic Sphinx I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.060 
so after a model this gigantic Sphinx I
am<00:01:45.820> trying<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.780> turn<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.110> into<00:01:47.230> a<00:01:47.350> real<00:01:47.770> level

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
am trying to turn it into a real level

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.860 
am trying to turn it into a real level
because<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.700> haven't<00:01:48.940> actually<00:01:49.090> been<00:01:49.360> sort<00:01:49.810> of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
because I haven't actually been sort of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.420 
because I haven't actually been sort of
like<00:01:50.110> laid<00:01:50.350> out<00:01:50.560> originally<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.280> was<00:01:51.400> just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
like laid out originally it was just

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.380 
like laid out originally it was just
self<00:01:51.960> built<00:01:52.960> as<00:01:53.140> he<00:01:53.230> went<00:01:53.380> along<00:01:53.440> ended<00:01:54.040> up

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
self built as he went along ended up

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.420 
self built as he went along ended up
just<00:01:55.390> essentially<00:01:56.350> taking<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.770> bunch<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.130> smoke

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
just essentially taking a bunch of smoke

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.150 
just essentially taking a bunch of smoke
a<00:01:57.730> bunch<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.300> my<00:01:58.480> test<00:01:58.840> rooms<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.500> really

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
a bunch of my test rooms that really

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.730 
a bunch of my test rooms that really
pushed<00:02:00.430> Lara's<00:02:01.330> movement<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.530> max

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
pushed Lara's movement to to the max

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.400 
pushed Lara's movement to to the max
that<00:02:03.040> were<00:02:03.190> basically<00:02:03.640> exploited<00:02:04.510> more

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
that were basically exploited more

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.620 
that were basically exploited more
interesting<00:02:06.310> combinations<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:07.060> moves<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
interesting combinations of moves and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.180 
interesting combinations of moves and
whack<00:02:07.870> them<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.170> as<00:02:08.320> these<00:02:08.500> side<00:02:08.740> rooms<00:02:09.009> around

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
whack them in as these side rooms around

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.180 
whack them in as these side rooms around
the<00:02:09.399> outside<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.290> really<00:02:11.890> make<00:02:12.070> an

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
the outside so it really make an

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.750 
the outside so it really make an
enormous<00:02:12.430> amount<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.000> fictional<00:02:13.450> sense<00:02:13.750> but

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
enormous amount of fictional sense but

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.760 
enormous amount of fictional sense but
they<00:02:15.760> were<00:02:15.940> some<00:02:16.630> more<00:02:16.959> interesting<00:02:17.290> sort<00:02:17.709> of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
they were some more interesting sort of

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.250 
they were some more interesting sort of
movement<00:02:17.920> poles<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:19.540> when<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.959> went<00:02:20.170> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
movement poles and when we went to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.370 
movement poles and when we went to
recreate<00:02:20.920> them<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.220> mean<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.610> original<00:02:22.000> one

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
recreate them I mean the original one

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.370 
recreate them I mean the original one
essentially<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:24.790> side<00:02:25.090> was<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:26.170> sort<00:02:26.320> of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
essentially one side was just sort of

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.560 
essentially one side was just sort of
pushing<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.950> block<00:02:27.270> through<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> wall<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
pushing the block through a wall and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.090 
pushing the block through a wall and
sort<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.440> had<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.620> figure<00:02:29.740> out<00:02:29.830> which<00:02:29.950> way

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
sort of you had to figure out which way

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.920 
sort of you had to figure out which way
to<00:02:30.160> push<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> block<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.780> other

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
to push the block and then the other

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.410 
to push the block and then the other
room<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.520> themed<00:02:33.520> around<00:02:33.670> sort<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.120> sliding

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
room was themed around sort of sliding

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.150 
room was themed around sort of sliding
down<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.930> jumping<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.350> right<00:02:35.560> time<00:02:35.800> onto

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
down and jumping at the right time onto

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
down and jumping at the right time onto
this<00:02:36.310> bridge<00:02:36.670> yeah<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:37.840> sliding

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
this bridge yeah it was sliding

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.080 
this bridge yeah it was sliding
direction<00:02:39.310> yeah

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
direction yeah

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.080 
direction yeah
which<00:02:40.890> worked<00:02:41.890> really<00:02:42.130> well<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.400> two<00:02:42.790> minute

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
which worked really well for two minute

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.449 
which worked really well for two minute
one<00:02:43.270> but<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.750> very<00:02:44.170> easy<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.739> do<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.160> Tomb

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
one but it's very easy to do in the Tomb

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.979 
one but it's very easy to do in the Tomb
Raider<00:02:45.489> anniversary<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:46.660> sort<00:02:46.840> of

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
Raider anniversary so we sort of

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.620 
Raider anniversary so we sort of
completely<00:02:47.739> changed<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.220> rooms<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.700> came<00:02:49.510> up

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
completely changed the rooms and came up

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.990 
completely changed the rooms and came up

with an a brand new puzzle involving the
obelisks<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> light<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.590> sort<00:02:54.100> of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
obelisks and the light and sort of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.160 
obelisks and the light and sort of
themed<00:02:54.580> both<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.000> rooms<00:02:55.180> similarly<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.959> sort

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
themed both the rooms similarly to sort

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.530 
themed both the rooms similarly to sort
of<00:02:56.230> try<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.250> give<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.820> area<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.209> sort<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
of try to give the area a sort of a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.699 
of try to give the area a sort of a
theme<00:03:00.810> originally<00:03:01.810> while<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:01.989> was<00:03:02.230> trying<00:03:02.650> to

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
theme originally while I was trying to

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.610 
theme originally while I was trying to
do<00:03:02.860> with<00:03:03.100> with<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.150> room<00:03:04.420> was<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.900> after

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
do with with this room was that after

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.949 
do with with this room was that after
having<00:03:05.739> built<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.280> gigantic<00:03:06.790> Sphinx

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
having built a gigantic Sphinx

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.430 
having built a gigantic Sphinx
I<00:03:07.989> couldn't<00:03:08.680> come<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:08.980> another<00:03:09.220> weekend<00:03:09.850> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
I couldn't come in another weekend and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.910 
I couldn't come in another weekend and
built<00:03:11.440> even<00:03:11.590> larger<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.610> sitting<00:03:13.090> down<00:03:13.120> dudes

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
built even larger and sitting down dudes

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.940 
built even larger and sitting down dudes
basically<00:03:14.920> our<00:03:15.160> Horace<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.640> Osiris<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.950> I

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
basically our Horace and Osiris and I

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.380 
basically our Horace and Osiris and I
thought<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.430> would<00:03:18.549> be<00:03:18.670> really<00:03:18.910> cool<00:03:19.120> if

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
thought it would be really cool if

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.449 
thought it would be really cool if
because<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.440> know<00:03:20.560> there's<00:03:20.950> supposed<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.400> be

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
because you know there's supposed to be

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.820 
because you know there's supposed to be
actually<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.180> chamber<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.110> LED<00:03:23.410> light<00:03:23.620> there

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
actually a chamber or LED light there

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.020 
actually a chamber or LED light there
was<00:03:23.920> rumors<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.519> there's<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.790> chamber

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
was rumors that there's a chamber

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.539 
was rumors that there's a chamber
between<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.810> actual<00:03:26.080> front<00:03:27.010> paws<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.519> the

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
between the actual front paws of the

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.729 
between the actual front paws of the
Sphinx<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:28.060> Egypt<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.110> thought<00:03:29.260> it'd<00:03:29.590> be

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
Sphinx in Egypt and I thought it'd be

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.289 
Sphinx in Egypt and I thought it'd be
pretty<00:03:29.830> cool<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.370> go<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.209> know

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
pretty cool to go and that you know

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.280 
pretty cool to go and that you know
that's<00:03:31.510> where<00:03:31.660> that's<00:03:31.959> where<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.200> would

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
that's where that's where you would

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.590 
that's where that's where you would
expect<00:03:32.650> your<00:03:32.739> prize<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.250> be<00:03:33.370> but<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.330> wanted<00:03:34.540> to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
expect your prize to be but I wanted to

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.729 
expect your prize to be but I wanted to
do<00:03:34.750> something<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.049> bit<00:03:35.110> different<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.620> had

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
do something a bit different so I had

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.289 
do something a bit different so I had
this<00:03:35.890> really<00:03:36.519> tiny<00:03:36.760> little<00:03:37.000> hole<00:03:37.269> that

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
this really tiny little hole that

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.990 
this really tiny little hole that
appears<00:03:37.840> after<00:03:38.230> you've<00:03:38.799> after<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.640> finally

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
appears after you've after you finally

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.780 
appears after you've after you finally
opened<00:03:40.330> up<00:03:40.769> down<00:03:41.769> all<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> side<00:03:42.220> rooms<00:03:42.519> in<00:03:42.700> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
opened up down all the side rooms in the

opened up down all the side rooms in the
big<00:03:42.940> Sphinx<00:03:43.269> room<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.630> then<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.110> just<00:03:44.320> sort

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
big Sphinx room and then you just sort

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.350 
big Sphinx room and then you just sort
of<00:03:45.070> go<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.280> wonder<00:03:45.850> what's<00:03:45.970> gonna<00:03:46.090> be<00:03:46.209> down

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
of go I wonder what's gonna be down

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.420 
of go I wonder what's gonna be down
there<00:03:46.570> but<00:03:47.049> it's<00:03:47.200> such<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> tiny<00:03:47.920> hole<00:03:48.160> not

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.670 
nothing much and then you drop down it
and<00:03:53.109> he's<00:03:53.470> literally<00:03:53.950> dropped<00:03:54.220> into

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
and he's literally dropped into

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.580 
and he's literally dropped into
into<00:03:55.159> a<00:03:55.189> room<00:03:55.459> with<00:03:55.730> two<00:03:56.239> statutes<00:03:56.689> even<00:03:57.349> more

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
into a room with two statutes even more

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.550 
into a room with two statutes even more
vast<00:03:57.920> than<00:03:58.400> where<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.299> came<00:03:59.510> from<00:03:59.569> and<00:04:00.049> that

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
vast than where you came from and that

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.920 
vast than where you came from and that
sort<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:01.010> reveal<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.610> actually<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.239> because

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
sort of reveal of actually and because

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.660 
sort of reveal of actually and because
it<00:04:03.049> was<00:04:03.200> water<00:04:03.560> filled<00:04:03.950> when<00:04:04.189> he<00:04:04.280> dropped<00:04:04.519> in

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
it was water filled when he dropped in

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.009 
it was water filled when he dropped in
there<00:04:04.909> you<00:04:05.090> kind<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.329> only<00:04:05.450> race<00:04:05.720> all<00:04:05.900> them

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
there you kind of only race all them

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.630 
there you kind of only race all them
when<00:04:06.140> he<00:04:06.200> dived<00:04:06.439> underwater<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.310> he

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
when he dived underwater and he

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.600 
when he dived underwater and he
essentially<00:04:07.970> were<00:04:08.510> flying<00:04:08.870> around<00:04:09.610> these

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
essentially were flying around these

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.030 
essentially were flying around these
these<00:04:11.060> massive<00:04:11.659> statues<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.230> thought<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:12.890> was<00:04:13.010> a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
these massive statues I thought it was a

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.590 
these massive statues I thought it was a
pretty<00:04:13.280> cool<00:04:13.700> way<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.349> introduced<00:04:15.349> him<00:04:16.600> so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
pretty cool way to introduced him so

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.539 
pretty cool way to introduced him so
this<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.870> one<00:04:18.289> of<00:04:18.320> sort<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.100> more

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
this is one of sort of the more

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.740 
this is one of sort of the more
interesting<00:04:19.759> changes<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.359> we<00:04:20.449> made<00:04:20.630> to

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
interesting changes that we made to

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.050 
interesting changes that we made to
Egypt<00:04:21.079> was<00:04:21.229> moving<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.250> sanctuary<00:04:22.910> of<00:04:22.970> the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
Egypt was moving the sanctuary of the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.629 
Egypt was moving the sanctuary of the
ski<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.449> to<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.110> bottom<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.190> level<00:04:25.460> and

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
ski on to the bottom of the level and

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.150 
ski on to the bottom of the level and
the<00:04:26.090> original<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:26.509> sort<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.810> came<00:04:27.620> down<00:04:27.860> and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
the original you sort of came down and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.210 
the original you sort of came down and
got<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:30.320> one<00:04:30.500> key<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.860> then<00:04:30.979> you<00:04:31.130> were

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
got this this one key and then you were

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.590 
got this this one key and then you were
able<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.550> go<00:04:31.789> all<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.030> way<00:04:32.090> back<00:04:32.270> up<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.449> the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
able to go all the way back up to the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.930 
able to go all the way back up to the
top<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.530> stairs<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.280> then<00:04:34.520> go<00:04:34.699> into<00:04:34.910> a

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
top of the stairs and then go into a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.180 
top of the stairs and then go into a
little<00:04:35.180> side<00:04:35.360> room<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.930> then<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.680> skin<00:04:36.919> was

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
little side room and then the skin was

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.590 
little side room and then the skin was
way<00:04:37.340> up<00:04:37.490> there<00:04:37.699> but<00:04:37.880> we<00:04:38.000> really<00:04:38.240> wanted<00:04:38.479> to

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
way up there but we really wanted to

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.980 
way up there but we really wanted to
sort<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.900> recreate<00:04:39.880> this<00:04:40.880> area<00:04:41.240> as<00:04:41.510> sort<00:04:41.810> of<00:04:41.870> a

sort of recreate this area as sort of a

sort of recreate this area as sort of a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600

fault at the bottom of the entire sort
of<00:04:44.690> Egypt<00:04:45.080> level<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:46.030> part<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.180> was<00:04:47.510> sort

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.300 
of making access into the very back
where<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.110> actually<00:04:51.260> can<00:04:51.590> get<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.099> third

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
where you actually can get the third

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.749

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
two pieces of ski on almost like they

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.730 
two pieces of ski on almost like they
were<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.770> key<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.729> that<00:04:59.599> you<00:04:59.750> needed<00:04:59.960> before<00:05:00.650> you

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
were a key to that you needed before you

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.100 
were a key to that you needed before you
could<00:05:00.889> gain<00:05:01.070> access<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.720> which

could gain access to it and this which

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.080 
could gain access to it and this which
makes<00:05:03.320> more<00:05:03.530> sense<00:05:03.889> from<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.340> story<00:05:04.699> point<00:05:04.880> of

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
makes more sense from a story point of
