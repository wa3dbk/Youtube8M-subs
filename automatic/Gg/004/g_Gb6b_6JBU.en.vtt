formatting<00:02:45.030> buttons<00:02:46.670> ok<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.910> learned

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
formatting buttons ok so we learned

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.400 
formatting buttons ok so we learned
about<00:02:48.120> dominant<00:02:48.630> visual<00:02:48.930> element<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
about dominant visual element and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.860 
about dominant visual element and
creating<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.769> visual<00:02:49.920> hierarchy<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:51.690> learned

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
creating a visual hierarchy we learned

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.190 
creating a visual hierarchy we learned
about<00:02:51.900> contrast<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:53.209> learned<00:02:54.209> about<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
about contrast we learned about the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.250 
about contrast we learned about the
direction<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.190> eye<00:02:56.220> goes<00:02:57.260> reading

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
direction that the eye goes reading

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.870 
direction that the eye goes reading
gravity<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.829> now<00:02:59.400> we've<00:02:59.549> learned<00:02:59.670> about

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
gravity and now we've learned about

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.800 
gravity and now we've learned about
alignment<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:02.459> write<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.120> down<00:03:03.329> as<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> rule

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
alignment so write this down as a rule

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.470 
alignment so write this down as a rule
