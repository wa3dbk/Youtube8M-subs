this one's a 70 95 70 and it's got you

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.850 
this one's a 70 95 70 and it's got you
know<00:05:09.520> it's<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.690> real<00:05:10.930> stiff<00:05:11.260> real<00:05:11.620> hard

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
know it's it it's real stiff real hard

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
know it's it it's real stiff real hard
this<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.729> little<00:05:13.000> softer<00:05:13.479> but<00:05:13.660> still<00:05:13.840> hard

them we'll just put them here and the

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:32.670 
them we'll just put them here and the
screens

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.860 

now<00:05:33.680> we're<00:05:33.860> ready<00:05:33.980> for<00:05:34.100> a<00:05:34.340> test<00:05:34.550> print<00:05:34.910> all

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
now we're ready for a test print all

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.120 
now we're ready for a test print all
right<00:05:35.990> next<00:05:36.380> we're<00:05:36.470> going<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.680> do<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.800> test

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
right next we're going to do a test

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.300 
right next we're going to do a test
print<00:05:37.450> make<00:05:38.450> sure<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.860> looks<00:05:40.100> alright
