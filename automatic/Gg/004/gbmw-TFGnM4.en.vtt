00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.839
 the chemists have their periodic table of the elements 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.979
 but here in the supermarket there could be a periodic table of the 

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.069
 foods 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.349
 many interesting substances that are the fruits and vegetables the cause 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.740
 continues for example is very rich in fibers 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.479
 and also in vitamin p 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.060
 the deficiency this vitamin k a disease called derive 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.670
 but also in the cause it is very rich 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.170
 among other things because it has a substance called china li na 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.180
 that modifies the perception of the bus 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.760
 a glass of water taken after eating the next one tastes different 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.350
 and if we talk about tastes we can not forget what they are 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 five are surely the most primitive foods we eat 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.390
 in its cell walls 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.450
 the same substance that is in the exoskeleton of insects 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 but they are also high in glutamic acid 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.240
 is the prototype of the so-called fifth hoffmann flavor and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.320
 discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century in japan 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 salty bitter has been publicized 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.950
 because of the brutal bullies 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.530
 after so many store syrup as a reserve substance the potatoes are very 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.010
 rich in starch thanks to these reserves can generate the process to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.790
 from the eyes 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.729
 these buds 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.979
 they are rich in substances called alkaloids that are potentially 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.920
 they also have protein vitamins and minerals like iron 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.470
 when we cook dads sometimes they change color by reactions that happens 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 just with the iron 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 but if we talk about iron we have to refer to other vegetables 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.940
 at the beginning of the 20th century a doctor calculated 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.380
 that for every 100 grams of spinach there were three milligrams of iron 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.770
 Element 26 of the periodic table 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 but someone was wrong to copy the data and wrote 30 milligrams or 100 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.209
 more times 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.139
 in 1937 the error was corrected 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.880
 about seven years ago 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.350
 he had already appeared on scene popeye the sailor 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.290
 with his enormous intake of tilapia that made him strong and so the fame grew 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.319
 celestina cta as the source of iron by the organism 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.210
 this has two errors the first 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.579
 that does not have that much iron 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.160
 and second that this iron present spinach 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.480
 and in other foods 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 it is not easily assimilated by the body and therefore does not have a high value 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.309
 nutritional 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.440
 besides iron 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.590
 Spinach has substances that were recently discovered 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.790
 which are very useful for the retina and for the vision for example the lutein and it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.090
 is being used as a preventive treatment with serious diseases 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.739
 coming out of tinelli arc 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.230
 and that has lutein to fulfill the mission one can wonder how it is 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.099
 what role is Libyan still saying
