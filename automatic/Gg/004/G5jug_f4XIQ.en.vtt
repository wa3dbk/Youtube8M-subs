00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.560
 I hope you are super mega jobs 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.110
 welcome once again to the channel and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 I come bringing another video of gilo 4 well 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 I already have all the specializations 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.850
 completed of turn 4 and I wanted to talk a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.080
 little quickly about how is not the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.240
 truth is that I thought it was very good that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.970
 put them on ice 4 gives a touch 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 different to the franchise to the game and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 well many people ask me which 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 is the best and which is the worst and so on 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.260
 no or which one to choose first without doubt 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.669
 you have limited edition 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.960
 the first one that has this record manager 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.780
 of pioneer since it will allow you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.000
 move a little faster but the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.399
 that I liked the most based on which 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.920
 more you notice the change is the road 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.350
 because the road has an improvement of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.360
 support call sword forgiveness stability 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 which is what we saw in his analysis and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.920
 the truth is that of all the improvements and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.199
 I think that's the most 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.219
 the one that works the most can be said the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.429
 best of all 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.739
 for me it would be road since this skill 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.530
 it helps a lot the truth does not move 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.140
 almost nothing looks at it with delete good if 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.549
 moves with eliminate but I got confused 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.979
 with eliminate almost does not move with the 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.600
 bear if you move a little and the truth 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 I think it would be that and before 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.360
 continue I want to tell you that down here 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.890
 the description I leave the analysis of 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.390
 all the specializations so that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.189
 go see it if you have not lost 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.360
 some are all ready 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.210
 so below in the description are the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.450
 I leave and well the truth is that they do not affect 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.009
 much the improvements is something very balanced 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.330
 I really liked something very very 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.970
 balanced there are no improvements you say 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.340
 are past and more of you are you are or not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.920
 you're super past no no no no the truth 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.729
 is that the truth is that they all offer 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.380
 something but but not but it does not affect 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.750
 it affects that is what is great and good 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.039
