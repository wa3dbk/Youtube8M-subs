00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.549
 at the beginning of plastic wood the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.560
 application of the plastic wood 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.219
 performed for the first time in the usa 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.129
 during the 60s for applications in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.890
 window frames and doors types of 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.310
 plastic wood there are two types of wood 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.169
 100% plastic which is obtained from 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 recycle polyethylenes and others 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.550
 thermoplastic materials the advantage of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 this type of plastic wood is that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.160
 It has all the properties of plastic 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.930
 and excellent mechanical properties 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 practical way with wood filling and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.239
 natural fibers is the combination of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.699
 natural wood or natural fibers with 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 recycled plastic does not have the same 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.620
 shelf life that the product made with 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.840
 100% recycled plastic that also 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 mixture degrades as do the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.370
 products the natural way this type 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.579
 of wood is also called the double 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.949
 ups what composite composite plastic 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.190
 wood plastic which is formed 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.740
 of 50 percent in vegetable fiber and 50% 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.550
 in plastic as wood is made 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.040
 plastic 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.150
 This way is installed by thermos 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.880
 thermal compression extrusion 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.920
 Thermo thermal compression is a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.620
 process that involves placing in a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.170
 hot mold a quantity of material 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.930
 which assumes the shape of said mold 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.420
 after a certain time to then be 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.960
 cooled to get its rigidity and 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.390
 solidify the extrusion is the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.030
 continuous process by which 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.190
 classifies transports and doses the dough 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.650
 of the polymer melted through a 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 nozzle or mold where it takes the shape of 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.970
 final product and upon its exit receives a 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.850
 sudden temperature change to be 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.190
 water cooled in Canada qualities and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.410
 advantages of the plastic way within 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.600
 the advantages of plastic wood this 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.310
 not only avoided deforestation also 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.240
 helps to decontaminate the environment 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.100
 ambient 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.040
 when collecting plastics and giving them a new 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.630
 life and use with recycling waste 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.940
 plastics products are made 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.710
 substitutes for other materials with the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.090
 that the ecological footprint of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.800
 carbon 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.440
 for each ton of plastic waste 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.989
 it is possible to avoid the felling of 10 trees 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.300
 and reduce the use of 18 tons 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.060

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.519
 other materials has a durability 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.370
 of more than 50 years in conditions 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.780
 extreme weather is economic and more 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.750
 lightweight than concrete and wood 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.269
 vegetable is safe as it does not splinter 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.599
