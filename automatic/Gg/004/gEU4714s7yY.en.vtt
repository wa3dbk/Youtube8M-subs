00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.070
 Hello dear friends with you for a long time 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.370
 steve today i want to share with you 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 your video recording experience in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 several video tutorials I will tell you how 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.330
 how I set up sound today 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.880
 his what is the best microphone you need 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 then use that sort of thing 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.130
 I will show you the following video tutorials. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 programs I use to record video 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 and mounting what with on advice for example like 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.879
 better to work in adobe rights came 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.950
 to see studio which is better to use 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 fraps or bandicam or komatsu again 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 studios so on like video 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 lessons will not be quite a lot but 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.809
 quite a lot but today we will stop 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.840
 specifically on the sounds first when buying 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.750
 microphone consider the cost of it not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.120
 need to buy some cheap for 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.910
 90 rubles sticks that are put on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.270
 the table and the type there will be supposedly good 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.189
 the sound is not a good shelf cost 1500 but for 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 such money, in principle, I also do not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.880
 I advise you to buy for the money you can 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.240
 buy a good normal capacitor 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.100
 microphone buy pop filter to him and a little 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.490
 whether not to have on his desk 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.909
 small small 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 recording studio I personally bought my 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.189
 a microphone somewhere for 650 700 rubles together 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.090
 with headphones he walked and I ran into 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.860
 One problem is when I think many 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.619
 know when you say pt sounds 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.170
 they fly into the microphone like the wind 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.479
 and therefore it does not reflect very well 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.909
 then play these sounds and 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.179
 for this there are pop filter and but by 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.860
 the filter is big no way not to put on 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.479
 my was a microphone so i did 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.380
 actually manually your little 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.509
 small as he did here please 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 a reference to the annotations in the annotations on 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.490
 this video later I encountered another 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.830
 with a few problems but a little later 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.830
 further in order to customize 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.950
 somehow your microphone and see 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.899
 does it work for that you need well 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.759
 in general there will be two ways right now 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.620
 consider the standard one that is 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.420
 all right click on this 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.310
 dynamics 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.230
 a recording device opens up 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.940
 the sound explosion tab has closed here and here 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.579
 we look we have a few 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.560
 different connected devices can 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.810
 to be a few microphones is like that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.880
 I may be externally connected 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.930
 you will not be allowed if you 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.480
 laptop or have a candy bar then you will have 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.540
 still u like an internal microphone then 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.519
 here one of them can not 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.829
 they disable or somehow but do 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.489
 to record it here or on a microphone 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.469
 already your nuggets zamorochki more precisely so 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.900
 Here if you connected you can 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:56.530
 see if it works with the button 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.180
 click on it properties in levels put 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.950
 here you can definitely 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 set up here with lazy microphone 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.220
 Gain customize because here 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.950
 This ability to record sound from different 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.319
 microphones are different and let's say if I 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.480
 would put on too kind of little on 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.489
 20 it seems a bit much but at 2 she herself 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.909
 never put on 30 because 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.939
 sound begins not sound itself your voice 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:25.030
 comer katsa and plus increase noise on 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.549
 background and they unrealistically begin 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.000
 cuts ears in the truest sense of the word 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.590
 so do not advise in improving in any way 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.989
 the case does not need to put anything because 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.060
 which is cruelly very deteriorating sound about 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.700
 I will also talk this far and in 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.189
 I don’t know the extra 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.729
 on studio recording I'm using it in 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:49.840
 principle and the sound is amplified a little 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:53.319
 and the record is good after all 96 is obtained 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.940
 gigahertz is great than simple 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.979
 burn a cd but in principle if 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.040
 honest to shoot letplay 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:04.030
 Enough to comment and disk 9 348 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.909
 GHz 16 2 channels if you really 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.090
 cool condenser mic you 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.190
 I advise you to put a studio recording 192 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.510
 gigahertz or 192 thousand herz 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.090
 but with this it is better not to bother 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.099
 if you have a driver like this 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.979
 realtek hd 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.710
 you don't need to ask for links 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.960
 I have no looking for myself to find it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.930
 easy just write realtek driver 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.720
 realtek not downloading here in tab 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.250
 microphone and adjust the volume 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.370
 recording playback volume and 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.800
 gain 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.710
 here in the effects 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.229
 we all turn off because not like i already 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.050
 spoke unrealistically spoils the microphone about not 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.270
 microphone your voice if you have 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.889
 there really is a very strong noise 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.080
 noise reduction is possible but not more 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.280
 echo cancellation 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.729
 do not need anything because it is not cruel 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.800
 invite microphone recording standard 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.500
 it's the same format again form a 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.949
 the format you use is basically everything 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.530
 and I also want to show you more 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.300
 see one thing in standard format 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.009
 we have studio quality and 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.520
 studio quality for a few two 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.919
 different frequency channels and let's 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.810
 let's see I recorded specifically in two 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.430
 different channels and look show how 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.650
 affected by these frequencies 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.250
 let's say now basically hear 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.110
 studio quality of 96 gigahertz and but 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.669
 I will demonstrate it to you very much 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.360
 ripper this is not this 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.090
 records 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.550
 Hello dear friends and today we 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.310
 we will play in minecraft here 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.740
 more or less pure a sound sound 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.270
 good nothing like not heard on 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.279
 external plan of course there are noises but their i 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.710
 I will not say that the voice is very audible 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:58.849
 principle pretty hear and 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.969
 distinctly 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.509
 perceived here is the second entry this 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:09.499
 will be 192 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:11.119
 gigahertz let's listen to everyone hello 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.149
 dear friends and today we will play 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:16.849
 in minecraft 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:19.879
 firstly the voice itself changes immediately 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.639
 I don’t argue for the better 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.459
 the fact that my microphone is still recording 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.039
 external noise in the room in general he has 

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:30.619
 some noise I don't know why it is connected 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.269
 apparently from that by the computer itself 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:33.860
 In short, we have problems in short 

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:37.429
 need an external sound card 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.409
 so because of this myself this noise 

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:41.629
 becomes downright metal he 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.399
 really gnash too and it is very 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.639
 very bad i don't want you to 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:48.169
 heard at all so but here I am to you 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.869
 demonstrated and it seems to me that 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.789
 all you need to know about audio 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.619
 in general, to be honest, if really 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.559
 to do it then you need different 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.330
 microphone amplifiers mixer and so on 

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:00.830
 something like that to achieve really 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.439
 cool sound but if you don't want 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.619
 spend the extra 25 thousand rubles as 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:08.110
 at least that's basically all you need 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:11.139
 need something more 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.639
 ordinary driver a little bit of knowledge 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.309
 experiment time and just 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.869
 roughly thousands of rubles on the microphone itself was 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:19.129
