00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.209
 I 'm coming to the Matsudo Gakuen Women's Judo Club's judo ground aiming for Nagano Prefecture championship victory 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.340
 now 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.870
 While sweating 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.870
 The driving is taking place 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.250
 It is Ito Naruse 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.310
 Captain Ito Thank you in advance 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.860
 Please give me a quick analysis of the present 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.980
 After all team than usual 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.340
 In a small circle 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.230
 On top of that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.520
 City pillow and 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 After all I firmly decide whether to buy and agree with a large partner 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.380
 The other today with a purpose in everyday practice 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 Buy will buy the wind that 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.920
 The people who went to the US practice 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.410
 After entering 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.360
 But 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.829
 And power 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.149
 After all, small minute 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.200
 I always try to put on weights after doing training etc. 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.930
 Even training to run 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.980
 To take care of elephant scissors 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:23.260
 I'm running hard now and I'm running out of strength 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.580
 It's such to say when compared to the money Lee and body might be a little small, but still tournament 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.659
 The goal of 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.700
 Move 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:34.230
 Firmly against big opponents 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.980
 Fail Date second child where you say I win 10 slaves 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.220
 Pigeon 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.220
 road 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.450
 Network of now-ku, 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:53.760
 Firmly in the 4th power convention in the previous battle 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:58.800
 I want to make sure that I can do it even if I enter that whole country or small . 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:04.020
 One way that leads to the whole country I want to do my best, but I'm sorry Sho Gakuen Judo Club is the beginning 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.670
 Although there is a word that it aims at the world's best, there is a thing to do its best with a big goal 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.760
 Is not it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.200
 It is good today 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.009
 Still high 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.569
 Wait 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.519
 m I want to aim 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.560
 Last but not give me a word to everyone of you and the radio equipment of a look at this video 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:27.709
 I will 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.709
 Since I will do my best in Tojocho Judo club space , I would like support by all means 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:40.640
 I am the director of Matsusho Gakuen Judo Club General Manager Keigo Yamaguchi Thank you. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.650
 Although the word "World No. 1" shines with the aim of directing 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:54.709
 Before about how that word did it listed in this dojo 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:56.090
 School's before you or I that marker I heard from now about 10 years is the word in Japan 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.520
 Because we raise 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.030
 What 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.300
 Think about going on that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.900
 Well what 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.900
 Without a thought 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:13.430
 I thought about it, but it is about 10 years ago 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:19.520
 There are players who are truly connected to the world already born from Konno Judo in Imonaga . 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.080
 To me really sitting in the players I that true to say so in that Thanks 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.010
 That great thing 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.690
 We can also teach with confidence 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.250
 Yes 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:37.750
 There are players who are connected to the world, but each such player 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:39.370
 Now there are to say the site where the aim of the martial arts hall of tatami are fighting the Nagano tournament literally 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.670
 The convention is approaching 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.680
 Zubari's only Matsusho now 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.680
 Team analysis please yes 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.990
 For example it is very painful and I said Well honest 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:04:01.440
 With a very small team compared to the national chain 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:03.810
 There is a big problem how to make this a big player fight 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.520
 I think I'm supposed to be 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.150
 Well What story from buying the still of the specimen But that 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.680
 Well small in the prefecture 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.300
 So a 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.959
 Don't make any mistakes 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.460
 Yes, I have thought that I would like to not beaten 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.580
 It means that there is no mistake, but after all the player who passes is passing 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.840
 This will be the one country where you win 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.220
 Well that in order to still win the other way 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.129
 Because there is no loss 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.870
 And the fact that Well not first defeated 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.220
 ANYTHING 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:50.370
 Not we have things like that going to take the point will become important Kana course of 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.490
 It is no mistake in the place went Anomaso Though the goal that takes a single 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.360
 Yeah 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.460
 I think it means to fight 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.669
 Last but not least everyone who listens to this radio and is watching this video 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.550
 Well everyone of ob who is expecting from Sho Gakuen may also have a look 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.050
 Yes by all means give me a few words 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.320
 Let's school judo 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:20.680
 While supported by many people 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.730
 Also everyone while leaving you doing in the future we have, such as those responding to everyone of your expected results 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.900
 It is cheering 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.900
 I would like to aim for a club, thank you in the future
