00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.149 

it's<00:00:00.179> really<00:00:00.510> easy<00:00:00.659> to<00:00:00.750> make<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.439> square<00:00:01.800> from<00:00:02.100> a

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
it's really easy to make a square from a

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.760 
it's really easy to make a square from a
rectangular<00:00:02.879> piece<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.360> paper<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:04.319> just<00:00:04.350> have

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
rectangular piece of paper you just have

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.169 
rectangular piece of paper you just have
to<00:00:05.040> fold<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:05.940> like<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:07.580> make<00:00:08.580> sure<00:00:08.820> that

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
to fold it like this and make sure that

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:22.010 
to fold it like this and make sure that
this<00:00:09.690> edges<00:00:10.200> are<00:00:10.440> aligned<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:20.330> then<00:00:21.330> fold<00:00:21.750> it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
this edges are aligned and then fold it

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:33.980 
this edges are aligned and then fold it
along<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.100> line

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.080 

and<00:00:34.990> then<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.350> can<00:00:35.560> take<00:00:35.830> scissors<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.820> cut

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
and then you can take scissors and cut

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.200 
and then you can take scissors and cut
along<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:38.560> crease<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:39.160> just<00:00:39.370> made<00:00:39.580> you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
along the crease that you just made you

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.290 
along the crease that you just made you
can<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:42.160> fold<00:00:42.790> it<00:00:43.030> once<00:00:43.360> again<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:44.020> run<00:00:44.830> your

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
can just fold it once again and run your

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:57.630 
can just fold it once again and run your
finger<00:00:46.300> around<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.520> then<00:00:48.940> fold<00:00:49.240> it<00:00:49.390> backwards

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.390 

and<00:00:58.640> now<00:00:58.970> you<00:00:59.030> can<00:00:59.540> just<00:00:59.570> reap<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.320> paper

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:14.359 

you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.679 

and<00:01:14.630> as<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.310> square<00:01:17.689> with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and as you can see we have a square with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
and as you can see we have a square with
a<00:01:19.020> fold<00:01:19.679> on<00:01:19.829> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
a fold on it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.120 
a fold on it
but<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.609> want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.060> make<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:22.069> square<00:01:23.069> with

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but if you want to make a square with

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.849 
but if you want to make a square with
our<00:01:23.579> Falls<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.079> take<00:01:25.319> two

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
our Falls you can just take two

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.429 
our Falls you can just take two
rectangular<00:01:26.069> sheets<00:01:26.819> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.539> put<00:01:27.869> them

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
rectangular sheets and then put them

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.899 
rectangular sheets and then put them
like<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.329> one<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.600> top<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.049> other<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
like this one on top of the other and

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
like this one on top of the other and
align<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.179> edges<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.709> then<00:01:37.709> you<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.009> have

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
align the edges and then you just have

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
align the edges and then you just have
to<00:01:38.490> fold<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:40.069> excess<00:01:41.069> paper<00:01:41.850> along<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.659> line

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.760 

and<00:01:57.079> then<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.409> can<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> same<00:01:58.220> thing<00:01:58.579> just

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and then you can do the same thing just

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.869 
and then you can do the same thing just
cut<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.979> with<00:02:01.460> scissors<00:02:01.729> or<00:02:02.210> rip<00:02:02.689> it
