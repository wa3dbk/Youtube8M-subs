to<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.560> better<00:02:04.890> integrated<00:02:05.460> ice

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
to be a little better integrated ice

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.270 
to be a little better integrated ice
cream<00:02:05.850> sandwich<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.750> usually<00:02:07.380> Android<00:02:07.979> skin

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
cream sandwich so usually Android skin

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400 
cream sandwich so usually Android skin
is<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> integrated<00:02:09.720> into<00:02:10.259> ice

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
is not really that integrated into ice

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.030 
is not really that integrated into ice
cream<00:02:10.679> sounds<00:02:11.009> you're<00:02:11.129> really<00:02:11.459> mess<00:02:11.700> up

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
cream sounds you're really mess up

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.970

the<00:02:12.129> whole<00:02:12.430> thing<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.719> energy<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.530> hopefully

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
the whole thing of energy so hopefully

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.069 
the whole thing of energy so hopefully
this<00:02:15.489> won't<00:02:15.760> really<00:02:16.180> take<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.719> the<00:02:16.870> good

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
three minutes against i think is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.259 
three minutes against i think is
incredible<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:53.019> will<00:02:53.200> help<00:02:53.290> pop<00:02:53.560> up<00:02:53.739> play<00:02:54.579> that

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
incredible it will help pop up play that

lets users watching video integral on

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.030 
lets users watching video integral on
the<00:02:58.150> screen<00:02:58.450> while<00:02:58.659> continue<00:02:59.139> to<00:02:59.319> use<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.739> lap

the screen while continue to use a lap

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.470 
the screen while continue to use a lap
so<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:00.639> just<00:03:00.939> going<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.180> be<00:03:01.239> pitching

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
so this really just going to be pitching

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.449 
so this really just going to be pitching
in<00:03:01.750> picture<00:03:02.139> and<00:03:02.560> they<00:03:02.650> say<00:03:02.829> it'd<00:03:03.069> be<00:03:03.220> good<00:03:03.400> for

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
in picture and they say it'd be good for

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.490 
in picture and they say it'd be good for
watching<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.939> video<00:03:04.120> attaching<00:03:05.019> without

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
watching the video attaching without

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.229 
watching the video attaching without
leaving<00:03:05.739> an<00:03:05.919> email<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:07.060> would

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
leaving an email so I think that would

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.490 
leaving an email so I think that would
be<00:03:07.359> really<00:03:07.389> cool<00:03:07.629> but<00:03:07.930> hopefully<00:03:08.290> they<00:03:08.379> don't

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
be really cool but hopefully they don't

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.949 
be really cool but hopefully they don't
block<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:08.889> for<00:03:09.099> me<00:03:09.189> too<00:03:09.400> much<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.930> is

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
block this for me too much so it is

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.960 
block this for me too much so it is
gonna<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.409> it<00:03:11.530> done<00:03:11.889> hopefully<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.669> huge

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
gonna have it done hopefully the huge

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.469 
gonna have it done hopefully the huge

how<00:03:16.780> they<00:03:16.930> take<00:03:17.109> an<00:03:17.199> attack<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.859> this<00:03:18.190> kind<00:03:18.430> of

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
how they take an attack on this kind of

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.770 
how they take an attack on this kind of
multitasking<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:20.650> they<00:03:21.220> say<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.940> no<00:03:22.299> word<00:03:22.540> on

guess<00:03:26.049> that'd<00:03:26.409> be<00:03:26.440> about<00:03:26.620> 199<00:03:27.400> could<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.669> gives

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
guess that'd be about 199 could I gives

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.580 
guess that'd be about 199 could I gives
