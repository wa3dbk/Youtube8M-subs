00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really want to mix a little bit of time

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.660 
really want to mix a little bit of time
here<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.969> mix<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.670> just

here to mix this up really well and just
using<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> fork<00:00:44.149> incidentally<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
using a fork incidentally you know this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.520 
using a fork incidentally you know this
is<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> more<00:00:47.579> fun<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.530> than

seem to be sold out a lot especially

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
seem to be sold out a lot especially
right<00:00:54.660> around<00:00:54.690> Christmas<00:00:55.230> time<00:00:55.260> which<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
right around Christmas time which is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
right around Christmas time which is
when<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> usually<00:00:56.129> want<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.670> things<00:00:56.960> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
when you usually want these things so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
when you usually want these things so
once<00:00:58.350> you've<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.680> the<00:01:31.250> critical<00:01:32.250> step<00:01:32.490> here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
once you've got the critical step here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.700 
once you've got the critical step here
I'm<00:01:32.909> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> take<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> fork<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.560> going

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
I'm going to take the fork and I'm going

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.749 
I'm going to take the fork and I'm going
to<00:01:34.740> rough<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.430> again

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to rough it back up again

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.969 
to rough it back up again
because<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.710> break

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
because if you don't it will break

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.179 
because if you don't it will break
rather<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.619> place<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.920> packed

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
rather one that place where you packed

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.460 
rather one that place where you packed
it<00:01:41.340> down<00:01:41.579> okay<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it down okay so I'm going to do this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:58.760 
it down okay so I'm going to do this
again<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> put<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.600> some<00:01:45.600> more

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.770 

quite<00:01:59.770> a<00:02:00.039> bit<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.250> force<00:02:00.429> here<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.450> set<00:02:01.659> it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
quite a bit of force here you set it

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.070 
quite a bit of force here you set it
down<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.109> use<00:02:02.890> your<00:02:02.950> body<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.399> lean<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.880> to
