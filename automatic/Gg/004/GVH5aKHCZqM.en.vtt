guy to this game and I found Raul's
house<00:00:15.630> i<00:00:16.080> believe<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.560> around<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.400> somewhere

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
house i believe is around here somewhere

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
house i believe is around here somewhere
let's<00:00:18.180> say<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.779> Nellis<00:00:19.260> Air<00:00:19.470> Force

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
let's say this is the Nellis Air Force

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.660 
let's say this is the Nellis Air Force
Base<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.779> is<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.109> Raul<00:00:22.590> shaft<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:24.109> south<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
Base this is that Raul shaft is south of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.519 
Base this is that Raul shaft is south of
the<00:00:26.670> Air<00:00:26.820> Force<00:00:27.240> Base<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.810> probably<00:00:28.199> right

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the Air Force Base it's probably right

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.259 
the Air Force Base it's probably right
next<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.160> brotherhood<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.730> steel<00:00:29.880> bunker

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
next to this brotherhood of steel bunker

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:46.840 
next to this brotherhood of steel bunker
actually<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> guess<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.280> closest<00:00:38.969> area

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.970 

will<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.940> vault<00:00:48.239> 34<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.440> walk<00:00:49.649> across

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
will be vault 34 and then we walk across

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.970 
will be vault 34 and then we walk across
or<00:00:51.050> now<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> Air<00:00:52.649> Force<00:00:52.920> Base

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
where I'm I like Jimmy's well and then

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.799 
where I'm I like Jimmy's well and then
we'll<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:56.270> let's<00:00:57.270> actually<00:00:57.480> place<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
