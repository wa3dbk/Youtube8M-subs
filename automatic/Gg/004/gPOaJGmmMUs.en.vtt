00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.320 

how<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.859> draw<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.550> tree<00:00:09.860> first<00:00:10.860> part<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.370> most

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
how to draw a tree first part is most

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.610 
how to draw a tree first part is most
people<00:00:12.599> don't<00:00:12.750> think<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.469> if<00:00:13.559> you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
people don't think about this but if you

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.330 
people don't think about this but if you
look<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> tree<00:00:14.190> see<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> trunk<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.630> kind<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
look at a tree see the trunk is kind of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.920 
look at a tree see the trunk is kind of
wavy<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.210> bottom<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.690> trunk

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
wavy like that the bottom of the trunk

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740 
wavy like that the bottom of the trunk
as<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.260> touches<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> ground<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.510> then<00:00:21.510> we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
as it touches the ground and then we

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.310 
as it touches the ground and then we
kind<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> curve<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:23.390> curve<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.960> then<00:00:25.109> out

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
kind of curve out curve in and then out

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.370 
kind of curve out curve in and then out
like<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.939> lot<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> trees<00:00:28.140> get

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
like that because a lot of trees get

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810 
like that because a lot of trees get
thicker<00:00:28.619> right<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> base<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.640> then

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
thicker right at the base and then

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
thicker right at the base and then
thinner<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.599> trunk<00:00:30.840> goes<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.320> then

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
thinner as the trunk goes up and then

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.330 
thinner as the trunk goes up and then
they<00:00:31.500> spread<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.920> again

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
they spread out again

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.209 
they spread out again
now<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.270> beauty<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.780> tree<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:35.010> there's

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
now the beauty of a tree is that there's

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.100 
now the beauty of a tree is that there's
no<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.760> wrong<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> tree's<00:00:36.840> as

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
no right or wrong way to do a tree's as

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
no right or wrong way to do a tree's as
you've<00:00:37.410> seen<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.800> grow<00:00:38.010> any<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.520> way<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> if

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you've seen can grow any which way so if

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
you've seen can grow any which way so if
you<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.170> you're<00:00:40.260> making<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.590> mistake<00:00:40.710> just

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you think you're making a mistake just

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.819 
you think you're making a mistake just
keep<00:00:41.520> adding<00:00:41.879> branches<00:00:42.660> adding<00:00:43.379> things<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
keep adding branches adding things to it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.930 
keep adding branches adding things to it
next<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.460> it'll<00:00:44.610> look<00:00:44.730> better

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
next thing you know it'll look better

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.450 
next thing you know it'll look better
than<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.360> imagined<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.770> it'll<00:00:47.250> start

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
than you even imagined so it'll start

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.450 
than you even imagined so it'll start
out<00:00:48.020> start<00:00:49.020> sectioning<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:50.039> top<00:00:50.280> with

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
out start sectioning off your top with

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
out start sectioning off your top with
these<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:56.480> that'll<00:00:57.480> section<00:00:57.899> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
these like that and that'll section it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.650 
these like that and that'll section it
off<00:00:58.140> into<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.500> branches<00:00:59.149> now<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> want

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
off into your branches now if you want

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.939 
off into your branches now if you want
to<00:01:00.719> stop<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> top

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
to stop right there you can do the top

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.590 
to stop right there you can do the top
like<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:07.369> like<00:01:08.369> we've<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.700> seen<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.210> when

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
like this like we've all seen when when

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.899 
like this like we've all seen when when
we<00:01:09.689> used<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> draw<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.290> first<00:01:10.560> grade<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.580> kind

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
we used to draw in first grade and kind

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.480 
we used to draw in first grade and kind
of<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.180> come<00:01:13.020> down<00:01:13.200> around<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of make it come down around and then you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.630 
of make it come down around and then you
can<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.689> these<00:01:15.900> little<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:17.310> lines

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
can take more of these little you lines

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
can take more of these little you lines
and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.630> cut<00:01:19.170> off<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.290> branches<00:01:19.799> right

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and you can cut off the branches right

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
and you can cut off the branches right
there<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
there or if you want to make the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.710 
there or if you want to make the
branches<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.590> more<00:01:23.720> branched

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
branches get a little bit more branched

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.890 
branches get a little bit more branched
out<00:01:24.869> before<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.770> hidden<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> leaves

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
out before they get hidden by the leaves

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.350 
out before they get hidden by the leaves
do<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.000> at<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.210> point

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
do a little of that but at some point

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.679 
do a little of that but at some point
you<00:01:33.360> cut<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:33.990> off<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.970> leaves<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.360> hiding

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you cut them off the leaves are hiding

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.310 
you cut them off the leaves are hiding
them<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:38.210> there<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.540> basic<00:01:39.689> tree<00:01:40.140> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
them and there is your basic tree you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.359 
them and there is your basic tree you
want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> put<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.549> bit<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> grass<00:01:43.369> around

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
want to put a little bit of grass around

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
want to put a little bit of grass around
out<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> give<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.439> more

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
out there you want to give a little more

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.410 
out there you want to give a little more
texture<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.340> there's<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:47.970> leaves

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
texture that there's some more leaves

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.740 
texture that there's some more leaves
around<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> close<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
around here and it kind of close that in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.370 
around here and it kind of close that in
and<00:01:53.060> they're<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.329> coolest<00:01:54.810> thing<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> put

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and they're the coolest thing is you put

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319 
and they're the coolest thing is you put
a<00:01:55.439> little<00:01:55.500> hole<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.070> little<00:01:56.399> hole<00:01:57.119> right<00:01:57.149> there

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
a little hole a little hole right there

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.780 
a little hole a little hole right there
and<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.619> make<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.799> look<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.490> cool

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and to make it look like really cool

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.660 
and to make it look like really cool
