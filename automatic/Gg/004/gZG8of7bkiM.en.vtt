we should talk about what it would

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.880 
we should talk about what it would
really<00:00:02.370> like<00:00:02.639> significant<00:00:03.240> relation<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.929> that

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
really like significant relation to that

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.440 
really like significant relation to that

also said anything and there are some
plants<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.870> really<00:00:07.550> talk<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.730> people<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.269> mean

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
plants that really talk to people I mean

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.230 
plants that really talk to people I mean
the<00:00:09.630> older<00:00:10.160> they<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.490> cut<00:00:11.700> lethal<00:00:12.059> has

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the older they have the cut lethal has

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.820 
the older they have the cut lethal has
been<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> very<00:00:12.599> public<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.380> nitrogen

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
been a very public is it's a nitrogen

been a very public is it's a nitrogen
consulate<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:15.260> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> native<00:00:16.859> plant<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.430> us

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
consulate that is a native plant to us

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.040 
consulate that is a native plant to us
and<00:00:18.510> people<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.439> used<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> seeing<00:00:20.160> them<00:00:21.050> and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and people are used to seeing them and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
and people are used to seeing them and
it's<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> first<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.939> goes

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it's you see one of the first that goes

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
it's you see one of the first that goes
in<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.779> building

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.750 

to<00:00:29.939> begin

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
to begin

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.240 
to begin
I<00:00:30.790> think<00:00:30.970> people<00:00:31.180> to<00:00:31.270> find<00:00:31.450> it<00:00:31.570> quite<00:00:32.250> quite

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
I think people to find it quite quite

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.400 
I think people to find it quite quite
easy<00:00:33.490> to<00:00:33.730> grasp<00:00:33.970> this<00:00:34.210> whole<00:00:34.450> concept<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.990> a

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
easy to grasp this whole concept of a

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.920 
easy to grasp this whole concept of a
forest<00:00:36.010> has<00:00:36.250> seven<00:00:36.700> layers<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.330> actually

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
forest has seven layers and actually

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.710 
forest has seven layers and actually
when<00:00:38.500> they're<00:00:38.620> going<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.130> wood<00:00:39.720> their

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
when they're going to a wood their

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.370 
when they're going to a wood their
seniors<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:41.770> action<00:00:42.100> was<00:00:42.760> there<00:00:42.970> for<00:00:43.380> when

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
seniors in action was there for when

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.690 
seniors in action was there for when
they<00:00:44.559> when<00:00:44.860> they<00:00:44.950> start<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.400> look<00:00:45.520> at<00:00:45.640> the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
they when they start to look at the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.060 
they when they start to look at the
plants<00:00:46.059> here<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.500> they<00:00:47.590> begin<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:47.920> realize

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
plants here and they begin to realize

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.799 
plants here and they begin to realize
that<00:00:48.280> actually<00:00:48.550> they're<00:00:48.850> crammed<00:00:49.150> in<00:00:49.390> because

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
that actually they're crammed in because

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.570 
that actually they're crammed in because
that's<00:00:50.050> what<00:00:50.260> would<00:00:50.379> happen<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:51.070> move<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.489> the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
that's what would happen we move in the

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.369 
that's what would happen we move in the
forest<00:00:51.940> then<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.870> begins<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.850> been<00:00:55.379> it's

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
forest then it begins it's been it's

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.500 
forest then it begins it's been it's
always<00:00:56.530> been<00:00:56.830> self-explanatory<00:00:57.370> yeah<00:00:58.360> we

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
always been self-explanatory yeah we

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.450 
always been self-explanatory yeah we
were<00:00:58.660> worried<00:00:59.020> that<00:00:59.050> when<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.590> first<00:00:59.800> started

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
were worried that when you first started

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.549 
were worried that when you first started
doing<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.510> this<00:01:01.900> is<00:01:02.050> quite<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.320> difficult

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
doing that this is quite a difficult

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
doing that this is quite a difficult
concept<00:01:03.159> to<00:01:03.309> get<00:01:03.430> across

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.850 

and<00:01:07.869> also<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:09.280> think<00:01:10.149> it's<00:01:11.079> exciting<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.829> see

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and also I think it's exciting to see

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.459 
and also I think it's exciting to see
loads<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.700> plants<00:01:12.939> together<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.509> are<00:01:13.659> useful

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
loads of plants together that are useful

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.700 
loads of plants together that are useful
edible<00:01:15.460> medicinal<00:01:18.509> forage

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
edible medicinal forage

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.580 
edible medicinal forage
this<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:21.759> know<00:01:21.909> they're<00:01:22.329> strong<00:01:22.689> its

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
this is you know they're strong its

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.870 
this is you know they're strong its
strong<00:01:23.679> relationship<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.220> people<00:01:27.579> don't

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
strong relationship and people don't

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.350 
strong relationship and people don't
realize<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.840> diversity<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.890> plants<00:01:30.399> until

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
realize the diversity of plants until

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.669 
realize the diversity of plants until
often<00:01:33.630> things<00:01:34.630> are<00:01:34.840> just<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.970> things<00:01:39.970> that

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
often things are just the things that

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.469 
often things are just the things that
because<00:01:41.679> they<00:01:41.830> are<00:01:41.979> edible<00:01:42.310> investment<00:01:43.209> we

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
because they are edible investment we

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.990 
because they are edible investment we
useful<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.500> kids<00:01:45.250> away<00:01:45.459> perceived<00:01:45.880> to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
useful is kids away perceived to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.850 
useful is kids away perceived to
actually<00:01:46.270> interact<00:01:46.569> with<00:01:46.869> nature

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
actually interact with nature

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.920 
actually interact with nature
it<00:01:48.250> was<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.760> events<00:01:49.150> or<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.840> be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
it was just all events or you just be

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.270 
it was just all events or you just be
looking<00:01:50.080> at<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:50.680> because<00:01:50.830> they've<00:01:51.130> got

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
looking at it but because they've got

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
looking at it but because they've got
uses<00:01:51.730> that<00:01:51.910> people<00:01:52.240> can<00:01:52.420> relate<00:01:52.630> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
uses that people can relate to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.380 
uses that people can relate to
understand<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.490> think<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:54.970> doesn't<00:01:55.120> make<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.300> bit

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
understand I think it doesn't make a bit

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.350 
understand I think it doesn't make a bit
and<00:01:56.900> in<00:01:57.020> terms<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:58.130> showgirl<00:01:58.520> which<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:58.970> what

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
and in terms of a showgirl which is what

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.090 
and in terms of a showgirl which is what
this<00:01:59.480> is<00:01:59.690> I've<00:01:59.840> been<00:01:59.990> working<00:02:00.320> backwards<00:02:00.770> and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
this is I've been working backwards and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.640 
this is I've been working backwards and
saying<00:02:01.900> when<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:03.020> put<00:02:03.200> all<00:02:03.290> these<00:02:03.440> together

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
saying when you put all these together

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.730 
saying when you put all these together
you<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.730> a<00:02:04.760> forest<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.200> have<00:02:06.440> a

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
you have a forest and then you have a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.080 
you have a forest and then you have a
model<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.760> most<00:02:07.970> sustainable

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
model of the most sustainable

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.240 
model of the most sustainable
environment<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.229> anywhere<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> planet

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
environment and anywhere on the planet

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.710 
environment and anywhere on the planet
which<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.399> what<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.910> forest<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.570> it's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
which is what the forest is because it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.300 
which is what the forest is because it's
self-perpetuating<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.920> if<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> hear<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
self-perpetuating and if you hear the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.860 
self-perpetuating and if you hear the
voice<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.790> live<00:02:13.970> remains<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.420> forests<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
voice of a live remains of forests and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.840

goes<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.300> renewing<00:02:24.300> itself<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.680> almost

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
goes on renewing itself so it's almost

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.040 
goes on renewing itself so it's almost
in<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> case<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.330> card<00:02:27.600> it's<00:02:27.750> almost<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
in the case of this card it's almost a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.480 
in the case of this card it's almost a
case<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.320> working<00:02:28.500> backwards<00:02:28.770> rather<00:02:29.400> than

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
case of working backwards rather than

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.940 
case of working backwards rather than
presenting<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.120> model<00:02:30.420> first<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.740> say

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
presenting the model first as you say

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.530 
presenting the model first as you say
people<00:02:32.310> pick<00:02:32.460> out<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> class<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.210> all<00:02:33.330> that's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
people pick out the class but all that's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.500 
people pick out the class but all that's
great<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.960> works<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.510> you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
great that works with that and then you

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.840 
great that works with that and then you
take<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> step<00:02:36.930> back<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.410> what<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.770> all<00:02:37.950> what

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
take a step back to what it's all what

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.580 
take a step back to what it's all what
his<00:02:38.970> concept<00:02:39.390> was<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> first<00:02:39.990> place<00:02:40.200> so

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
his concept was in the first place so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.160 
his concept was in the first place so
yeah<00:02:41.000> immediate<00:02:42.000> obviously<00:02:42.630> our<00:02:42.750> brief<00:02:43.020> has

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
yeah immediate obviously our brief has

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.910 
yeah immediate obviously our brief has
always<00:02:43.350> been<00:02:43.590> because<00:02:43.800> I've<00:02:44.040> started<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:46.770> get

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
irresponsible to have a go

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.510

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
most many but the fact that the plants

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.800 
most many but the fact that the plants
can<00:03:54.629> take<00:03:54.810> atmospheric<00:03:55.440> nitrogen<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:57.510> hold

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
can take atmospheric nitrogen and hold

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.330 
can take atmospheric nitrogen and hold
it<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.080> bacteria<00:03:58.650> on<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.980> roots<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
it in bacteria on the roots and

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.460 
it in bacteria on the roots and
distribute<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.090> tender<00:04:00.840> plant<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.319> he's

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
distribute it so tender plant so he's

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.100 
distribute it so tender plant so he's
almost<00:04:01.709> up<00:04:01.890> there<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.190> photosynthesis<00:04:03.110> it's

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
almost up there with photosynthesis it's

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.220 
almost up there with photosynthesis it's
astonishing<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.420> good<00:04:06.629> it's<00:04:06.900> good<00:04:07.049> to
