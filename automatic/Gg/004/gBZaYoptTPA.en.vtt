00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
all right here's Kalin kind of hanging

00:00:09.760 --> 00:01:58.110 
all right here's Kalin kind of hanging
around<00:00:09.820> it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:09.630 

cool<00:02:04.660> so<00:02:05.660> this<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.990> probably<00:02:06.350> 19<00:02:06.860> 18<00:02:07.340> 19<00:02:07.970> 20<00:02:08.360> ish

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
cool so this is probably 19 18 19 20 ish

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.840

original

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.160 

got<00:02:51.849> our<00:02:51.969> oil<00:02:52.090> points<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.749> the<00:02:52.870> crankshaft

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
got our oil points on the crankshaft

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:02.849 
got our oil points on the crankshaft
here<00:02:57.540> our<00:02:58.650> grease<00:02:59.650> cap<00:02:59.920> for<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:01.859> connecting

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
here our grease cap for the connecting

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:10.910 
here our grease cap for the connecting
rod<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.519> our<00:03:06.639> oiler<00:03:06.969> shut<00:03:07.719> that<00:03:07.840> off<00:03:07.900> now

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.520 

this<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.219> throttle<00:03:12.719> it<00:03:13.719> just<00:03:13.930> adjusts<00:03:14.379> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
this is the throttle it just adjusts the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.129 
this is the throttle it just adjusts the
spring<00:03:14.799> tension<00:03:15.010> on<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.489> governor<00:03:16.079> so<00:03:17.079> you

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
spring tension on the governor so you

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:35.110 
spring tension on the governor so you
can<00:03:17.290> speed<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.159> or<00:03:18.280> slow<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.459> down

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.759

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
spring here's the carburetor and the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.839 
spring here's the carburetor and the

choke cask in fuel pickup comes from
inside<00:04:09.269> here<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:10.470> got<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> ball<00:04:10.950> check<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.489> it

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
inside here it's got a ball check on it

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.210 
inside here it's got a ball check on it
so<00:04:11.819> when<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.060> sucks<00:04:12.299> up<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:13.380> ball<00:04:13.560> closes<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
so when it sucks up the ball closes and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.460 
so when it sucks up the ball closes and
keeps<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> fuel<00:04:15.209> from<00:04:15.420> running<00:04:15.840> out<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:19.260> is

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
keeps the fuel from running out this is

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.500 
keeps the fuel from running out this is
the<00:04:20.479> timing<00:04:21.479> advance<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.500> retard<00:04:22.650> system

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
the timing advance and retard system

the timing advance and retard system
that<00:04:24.510> retards<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.020> timing<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.530> don't<00:04:25.770> know

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
that retards the timing I don't know

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.810 
that retards the timing I don't know
five<00:04:26.250> degrees<00:04:26.669> or<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.490> once<00:04:29.610> it's

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
five degrees or so and then once it's

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.529 
five degrees or so and then once it's
running<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:32.120> can<00:04:33.290> close<00:04:34.290> that<00:04:34.530> back<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.740> and

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
running you can close that back up and

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.420 
running you can close that back up and
get<00:04:36.539> your<00:04:36.690> regular<00:04:36.870> timing<00:04:37.410> I've<00:04:38.010> set<00:04:38.310> the

get your regular timing I've set the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.550 
get your regular timing I've set the
timing<00:04:38.850> at<00:04:38.940> about<00:04:39.180> oh<00:04:41.000> maybe<00:04:42.380> ten<00:04:43.380> degrees

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.630 
there was some fuel in the tank that was
pretty<00:06:18.650> rancid<00:06:19.160> so<00:06:20.030> we<00:06:20.090> got<00:06:20.210> that<00:06:20.390> cleaned<00:06:20.660> out

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
pretty rancid so we got that cleaned out

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.510 
pretty rancid so we got that cleaned out
the<00:06:22.640> timing<00:06:23.060> was<00:06:23.240> way<00:06:23.570> advanced<00:06:24.490> so<00:06:25.490> I

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
the timing was way advanced so I

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.450 
the timing was way advanced so I
retarded<00:06:26.120> that<00:06:26.270> back<00:06:26.830> from<00:06:27.830> I<00:06:28.100> think<00:06:28.280> it<00:06:28.370> was

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
retarded that back from I think it was

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.810 
retarded that back from I think it was
probably<00:06:28.660> 30<00:06:29.660> degrees<00:06:30.050> past<00:06:30.950> top<00:06:31.280> dead<00:06:31.490> center

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
probably 30 degrees past top dead center

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.070 
probably 30 degrees past top dead center
or<00:06:32.090> before<00:06:32.570> top<00:06:32.750> dead<00:06:32.780> center<00:06:34.690> I've<00:06:35.690> got<00:06:35.960> it

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
or before top dead center I've got it

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.580 
or before top dead center I've got it
maybe<00:06:36.230> now<00:06:36.410> 10-15<00:06:37.070> degrees<00:06:37.160> before<00:06:38.530> but<00:06:39.530> the

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
maybe now 10-15 degrees before but the

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.890 
maybe now 10-15 degrees before but the
big<00:06:39.740> problem<00:06:39.890> was<00:06:40.160> the<00:06:40.310> ignition<00:06:40.640> I'm<00:06:40.820> I'm<00:06:41.600> not

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
big problem was the ignition I'm I'm not

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.430 
big problem was the ignition I'm I'm not
familiar<00:06:42.110> with<00:06:42.380> the<00:06:43.040> magneto<00:06:43.430> ignition<00:06:43.640> and

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
familiar with the magneto ignition and

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.200 
familiar with the magneto ignition and
it<00:06:45.440> turns<00:06:45.650> out<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:45.920> had<00:06:46.160> too<00:06:46.310> much<00:06:46.430> gap<00:06:46.760> on<00:06:47.150> the

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
it turns out I had too much gap on the

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.250 
it turns out I had too much gap on the
spark<00:06:47.630> plug<00:06:47.810> and<00:06:49.210> it<00:06:50.210> really<00:06:50.510> didn't<00:06:50.900> run<00:06:51.020> very

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
spark plug and it really didn't run very

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:57.920 
spark plug and it really didn't run very
well<00:06:52.240> so<00:06:53.410> now<00:06:54.410> I<00:06:54.790> think<00:06:55.790> we're<00:06:55.940> gonna<00:06:56.030> go<00:06:56.120> cheap

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
well so now I think we're gonna go cheap

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.639 
well so now I think we're gonna go cheap
you<00:06:58.830> what<00:06:59.400> say<00:06:59.580> you
