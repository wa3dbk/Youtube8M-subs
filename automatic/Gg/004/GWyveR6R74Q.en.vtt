most Internet images are at 72 so it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.109

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
would look like it was an 8 by 10 72 if

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.850 
would look like it was an 8 by 10 72 if
I<00:01:42.479> wanted<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.170> smaller<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.649> the

I wanted it to be smaller for the
internet<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.880> change<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> 8<00:01:47.100> or

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
internet I would just change it to 8 or

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.719 
internet I would just change it to 8 or
7<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:49.229> long<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.890> constrain

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
I'm going to get my zoom tool and just

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.580 
I'm going to get my zoom tool and just
zoom<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.740> in<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.160> bit<00:02:18.990> okay<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.020> now<00:02:20.530> we

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
zoom this in a little bit okay so now we

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.610 
zoom this in a little bit okay so now we
knew<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> height<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.430> 7<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.170> width<00:02:23.410> is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
knew the height is 7 and the width is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.720 
knew the height is 7 and the width is
5.6<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> we<00:02:26.140> need<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.500> get<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.920> down<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.160> 5<00:02:27.460> so

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
5.6 so we need to get this down to 5 so

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.160 
5.6 so we need to get this down to 5 so
we're<00:02:27.850> going<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.030> come<00:02:28.180> over<00:02:28.210> here<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.870> width

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
we're going to come over here to width

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.420 
we're going to come over here to width
and<00:02:29.620> we're<00:02:30.190> going<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.400> put<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:30.670> 5<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.590> for

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and we're going to put in 5 I in and for

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.890 
and we're going to put in 5 I in and for
height<00:02:33.580> we're<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> put<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.470> 7<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:36.100> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
height we're going to put in 7 I in and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.480 
height we're going to put in 7 I in and
we're<00:02:37.900> going<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.080> leave<00:02:38.200> resolution<00:02:38.950> blank<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
we're going to leave resolution blank so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.580 
we're going to leave resolution blank so
that<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.730> won't<00:02:39.850> change<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.780> I'm<00:02:41.380> going<00:02:41.530> to
