00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 it's him everyone is correct 0.3 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 so let's go for an episode a bit 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.280
 special actually is the episode between the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.230
 12 and 13 to heal himself in the course of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.660
 route only for the little tutorial that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.450
 I will do a moment I invite you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.330
 to go on my channel and see the others 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 episodes know at least you'll be 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.880
 how did I get to the ace you were 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.949
 beyond that factory there and that's the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 true all my mistakes I made and 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.449
 all the good ideas I had 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.239
 also arms also help me to make a 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.010
 African to organize UN to me 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.950
 give some info if you have some 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.829
 or on the contrary pick up info if you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 do not know much about gambling then in 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.039
 this tutorial what we will do is explained 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.570
 quickly done the network circuits finally I 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 not sure there is not really no I 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 think the system network in English so 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.300
 the network theme and then the networks 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.609
 it's useful it's for already how 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 to climb into the vaults some objects 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.530
 and then say smart arm has 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 spent here 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.549
 if they will work or not we can 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.799
 have to parameterize them and suddenly here this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.780
 what I have is a production of a stop 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.590
 of steel plates and I would have 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.390
 stopped I could have put very well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 my smart arms here so once 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.290
 that I will have a number of plates 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.330
 steel in my trunk and ben my 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 armband is the problem is that the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 ovens they will continue to build 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.150
 to finally melt anyway and that's 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.740
 not my goal so on the other hand if I put to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.930
 arm here that we would arrange that in the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.430
 other episodes because it was not 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 all my goal to make a system like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.630
 that especially to feed a worthy of 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.360
 ovens for making steel 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.360
 already there I do not need so much 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:04.710
 treadmills also need a 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.020
 need this one and I'm going to put my 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.929
 smart arm so so that's the arm 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.370
 to here she is smart beautiful 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.020
 it works a little like the arms 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.230
 fast where the what filters these 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.060
 enthusiasts available that's it 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700
 works identically as the arm 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.160
 robotic sorting the only difference 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.400
 it is that we can set them of course 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.680
 you have to connect the arm with wires 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.360
 red where queues to gold here I 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.650
 already made I think that day yeah 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.580
 here I have the green wire that are 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.340
 available here 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.190
 they are found in the electricity part 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.720
 green cable and advance has already passed my 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.790
 chest so use the only way 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.940
 to count the objects that in a safe 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.150
 it's with smart chests 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.150
 6 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.209
 do not know if I stay so 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:06.400
 stack one two three four five races and 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.010
 presto take it off I have all my plates 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.719
 who are in my inventory and I'm going 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.420
 put a smart chest 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.329
 so normally 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.650
 the brave to fill everything i'll put 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.280
 my steel plates in my trunk 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.139
 smart here and he is able to 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:33.870
 counting how much I have 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:37.930
 so falls do not tell this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.609
 way there then we have here this arm this 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.629
 smart arm that works stupidly 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.290
 prone moment he's not so smart 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:47.310
 that it does its normal arm role 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.260
 and will pass the plates on one side 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.969
 me it works Sixes pack a 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.159
 side to side and I want to do in 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.349
 kind of stop this will be there once 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.060
 I have a number in in my 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.430
 chest 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.879
 so I have to connect all that so 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.840
 I take my cables to take a 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.370
 electric pole 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.650
 his loved ones because it's on the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.790
 post we will start the collection I 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.489
 go click on this one 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.319
 right critical hop and we see I pass 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.260
 I can see that I have a son to whom 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.349
 walk and games connected to the trunk and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.699
 click on it to say l connected to 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.620
 smart brown so here I will be able to 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.360
 directly connect I do not 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.460
 right now I could show this 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.400
 we can do is that here we see 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.169
 further we can connect two 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.169
 poles not everything and everything 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:43.060
 you show here and I connect my 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.759
 son to my arm so basically this chest 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.550
 is networked to montbray 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.349
 intelligent by the way if we pass on 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.479
 an electric pole whose boot passed 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:58.000
 on this one is connected to my cable 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:02.110
 green and we see here we see the sign 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.680
 we see that I have 1.1 cases so more 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.039
 or less than 1100 steel plates in my 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.129
 safe and I'll tell my arm here if 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:16.270
 you have more than 500 late is 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.949
 to feed into production so 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.690
 I click here and here I have a 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.770
 condition that appeared so I click 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.479
 to say what are we going to filter to 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.330
 look for the iron plates so basically 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:32.289
 the arm here he'll say as much as I've 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.419
 more forgiveness iron iron plate so much 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.219
 that there is more than one steel plate and 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.830
 well we continue and see that there is more 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.199
 from a canam steel plate they know 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.580
 that's right and the arm continue to 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.250
 operate so we will change the 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.349
 condition and we put smaller so 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.330
 tries the number of steel plates is 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.729
 smaller than the name I will tell him 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.199
 stop harmful as in a thousand cent and that 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.969
 in the condition we have a skillful 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.240
 stop and work more back if 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.310
 I 'm going here and I'm going to put some 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.990
 two thousand hospitals revive and as soon as 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.490
 I will have two cities three thousand, 3000 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.490
 is that I would have 3000 m 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.920
 but 3000 steel plates it goes 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:17.760
 stop good rhythm it really since 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:19.770
 so I put it in May 2500 and this 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.710
 So we have a cuff and that's why I 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.910
 I will not consume to build 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.730
 steel plates unnecessarily then 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.540
 but now it's over for this little tutorial 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.770
 I hope you understand 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.960
 you understood everything 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.370
 and here is hi everyone I you 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.170
 also invite you to subscribe to my channel 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.070
 and to see the other let's play 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:44.360
 all the other episodes 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.360
 Here it everyone
