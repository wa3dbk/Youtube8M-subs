00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.460
 cobo today has almost everyone but a 1.2 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 liter petrol engine with compressor 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.110
 Support is a rarity 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.250
 So far, there was the nissan micra with one 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.109
 normal 1.2 liter motor with 80 ps the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.380
 same three-cylinder also has the new one 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.989
 model but with gasoline direct injection 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.529
 and compressor support therefore also 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.960
 the name 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.110
 dig s stands for direct injection 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.000
 gasoline supercharged purely optical 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.710
 the charged micra differs 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.350
 from the sucker by the extended one 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.810
 striking rear spoiler and a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.090
 sportier front bumper at the 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.180
 driving performance promises nissan 18 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.710
 additional ps more driving fun and before 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.230
 all about one liter 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.830
 lower standard consumption and significantly 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.400
 lower emissions more power and 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:01.210
 less consumption 98 ps and 4.1 liters 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.210
 Gasoline only 95 grams CO2 per kilometer 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.610
 how is the compressor going only 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.909
 switched on when more power is needed 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.490
 becomes 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.920
 at lower speed switches 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.020
 a clutch in from to save fuel 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.340
 when accelerating are high 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.499
 speeds avoided 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.990
 more power at the compressor early 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:22.479
 There is also a standard 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.420
 start automatically stops the engine when 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.990
 stop the traffic lights off as far as the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.119
 theory 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.700
 who, however, the promised 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.280
 driving pleasure also wants to feel saves 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.829
 significantly less gas is used 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.270
 the traffic lights and high speeds are driving 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.909
 the consumption in the height 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.530
 the start stop system waives 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.780
 Turn off the engine if it is 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.679
 outside is too cold or the air conditioning 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.090
 Energy does not need ours 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.369
 Representative exits was the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.380
 Consumption far away and it 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.689
 was often a seven before the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.219
 comma also we would have one 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.569
 sixth course wanted the the 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.249
 consumption and especially the 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.340
 noise level at faster speeds 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:05.499
 could additionally lower, however 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.119
 we have to admit that we are in one 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.190
 micra dig-s in the highest 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.640
 equipment variant tekna on the way 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.770
 were 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 this is harder than the basic version 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.860
 and accordingly, the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.910
 Manufacturer information for consumption 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.340
 4 3 liters for co2 emissions on 99 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.650
 there is a gram in micra teschner 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.920
 standard a panorama glass roof and 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.200
 the navigation audio and 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.090
 communication system nissan connect the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.790
 on-board computer shows next to small 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.500
 trees symbolize that through the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.100
 start-stop system saved co2 quantity 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.320
 and thus ensures a green conscience 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.470
 for the nissan micra dig-s need 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.100
 at least 17,000 40 euros to be paid 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.700
 the basic equipment costs 13 1440 euro 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.470
 the compressor costs 1600 euro more than 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.560
 the normal suction motor 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.720
 who is economical and worth little 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.180
 on a sporty driving style lays down for 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.140
 that is the charged micra certainly 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.959
 an option 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.090
 but what remains is the question of whether nissan 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.380
 not just the micra as 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.380
 should offer diesel
