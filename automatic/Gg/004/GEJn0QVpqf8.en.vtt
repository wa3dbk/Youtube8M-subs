harder<00:00:58.829> than<00:00:58.980> sin<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.030> only<00:01:00.180> use

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
harder than sin but really we only use

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
harder than sin but really we only use
like<00:01:00.780> whereas<00:01:01.109> sin<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.770> five<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> these

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like whereas sin had about five of these

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189

we<00:01:02.699> only<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.359> five<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
we only use about five of them so the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.359 
we only use about five of them so the
rest<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.250> look

rest of them are just to make it look

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
rest of them are just to make it look
more<00:01:05.790> expensive<00:01:06.260> it's<00:01:07.260> pretty<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> same
