minimal it tangles in the nape of her

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.240 
minimal it tangles in the nape of her
neck<00:05:41.340> where<00:05:42.120> most<00:05:42.420> hair<00:05:42.840> does<00:05:43.050> tangle<00:05:43.590> but<00:05:43.980> it

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
neck where most hair does tangle but it

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.950 
neck where most hair does tangle but it
also<00:05:44.430> comes<00:05:44.730> with<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:45.000> link<00:05:45.240> this<00:05:45.630> hair<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.900> very

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
also comes with a link this hair is very

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.740 
also comes with a link this hair is very
long<00:05:46.230> so<00:05:46.880> um<00:05:48.140> my<00:05:49.140> friend<00:05:49.350> had<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.500> 14<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:51.390> 12

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
long so um my friend had a 14 and a 12

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.890 
long so um my friend had a 14 and a 12
and<00:05:51.960> her<00:05:52.080> hair<00:05:52.380> never<00:05:53.060> tangled<00:05:54.060> so<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.330> think<00:05:54.810> it

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
and her hair never tangled so I think it

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.780 
and her hair never tangled so I think it
has<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.140> do<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.470> lot<00:05:55.710> with<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.040> length<00:05:56.400> of<00:05:56.610> this

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790
