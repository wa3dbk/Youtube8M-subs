00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
got it was something inside when it

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.680 
got it was something inside when it
stood<00:02:31.720> out<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:32.019> probably<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.560> charger<00:02:33.040> here

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.180 

USB<00:02:37.690> based<00:02:37.900> charger<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.680> they're<00:02:38.799> probably<00:02:39.010> a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
USB based charger so they're probably a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.970 
USB based charger so they're probably a
USB<00:02:39.700> cable<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.690> there<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
USB cable here and there it is not a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.979 
USB cable here and there it is not a
standard<00:02:45.519> connector<00:02:46.239> on<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> though<00:02:46.690> it's

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
standard connector on it though it's

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.270 
standard connector on it though it's
some<00:02:47.200> sort<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.560> very<00:02:47.920> small<00:02:48.630> USB<00:02:49.630> connector

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
some sort of very small USB connector

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.590 
some sort of very small USB connector
but<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.489> standard<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.150> side<00:02:52.359> so<00:02:52.540> you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
but it is standard on this side so you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.960 
but it is standard on this side so you
can<00:02:52.750> plug<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.049> into<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.560> wall<00:02:54.340> charger<00:02:54.370> here

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
can plug it into the wall charger here

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.270

the<00:03:30.190> physical<00:03:30.910> design<00:03:31.209> appears<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.019> know

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
the physical design appears you know

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.319 
the physical design appears you know
we've<00:03:32.260> got<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.560> course<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.950> aunt<00:03:33.370> button<00:03:34.150> here

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
we've got of course the aunt button here

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.140 
we've got of course the aunt button here
for<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.569> call<00:03:34.840> send<00:03:35.140> end<00:03:35.970> appears<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.120> have

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
for a call send end appears we have

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.559 
for a call send end appears we have
volume<00:03:37.660> control<00:03:38.049> on<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.290> left<00:03:38.590> edge<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.569> no

volume control on this left edge and no
other<00:03:40.720> obvious<00:03:40.989> controls<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:43.180> likely<00:03:43.510> that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
other obvious controls it's likely that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.210 
other obvious controls it's likely that
this<00:03:43.780> button<00:03:44.049> here<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.410> used<00:03:44.590> for<00:03:44.680> power<00:03:44.920> we'll

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
this button here is used for power we'll

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.860 
this button here is used for power we'll
have<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.489> confirm<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.450> there<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.720> course

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
have to confirm that and there of course

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.620 
have to confirm that and there of course
is<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.109> non-standard<00:03:48.040> USB<00:03:48.940> type<00:03:49.180> connector

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
is that non-standard USB type connector

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.970 
is that non-standard USB type connector
for<00:03:49.780> charging<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:52.239> can<00:03:52.359> see<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.840> ear<00:03:53.739> loop

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
for charging you can see the ear loop

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.030 
for charging you can see the ear loop
swivels<00:03:54.760> around<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.420> also<00:03:55.659> has<00:03:55.959> some<00:03:56.040> leeway

in<00:03:57.280> terms<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.640> forward<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.060> back<00:03:58.269> motion

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
in terms of forward and back motion

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.350 
in terms of forward and back motion
can<00:04:00.610> pull<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.180> out<00:04:01.269> easily<00:04:01.510> enough<00:04:03.360> reinsert

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
can pull it out easily enough reinsert

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.130 
can pull it out easily enough reinsert
it<00:04:04.540> for<00:04:04.840> left<00:04:05.470> or<00:04:05.620> right<00:04:05.950> ear<00:04:06.129> use<00:04:07.140> overall

it for left or right ear use overall

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.259 
it for left or right ear use overall
seems<00:04:08.349> like<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.500> pretty<00:04:08.680> decent<00:04:08.799> design<00:04:09.269> nice

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
seems like a pretty decent design nice

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.479 
seems like a pretty decent design nice
soft<00:04:10.900> earbud<00:04:11.440> gel<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.010> there's<00:04:12.129> a<00:04:12.190> smaller

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
one that came in the box and we saw I

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.080 
one that came in the box and we saw I
have<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.310> try<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:15.549> out<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.879> see<00:04:16.030> how

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
have to try that out and see how

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.840 
have to try that out and see how
comfortable<00:04:16.329> it<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:18.130> after<00:04:18.310> doing<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.579> quick

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
comfortable it is so after doing a quick

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.830 
comfortable it is so after doing a quick
test<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.630> feels<00:04:20.440> very<00:04:20.560> comfortable<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.840> very

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
test it feels very comfortable I very

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.430 
test it feels very comfortable I very
much<00:04:22.900> like<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.460> soft<00:04:24.460> earbud<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
much like the soft earbud here and the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.659 
much like the soft earbud here and the
ear<00:04:26.560> loop<00:04:26.740> definitely<00:04:27.130> holds<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.550> place

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
ear loop definitely holds it in place

command check battery you can see I said
headset<00:06:01.849> battery<00:06:02.090> is<00:06:02.180> medium<00:06:02.569> and<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.750> phone

headset battery is medium and the phone
battery<00:06:03.199> was<00:06:03.590> high<00:06:04.240> there's<00:06:05.240> a<00:06:05.330> large<00:06:05.569> number

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
battery was high there's a large number

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.080 
battery was high there's a large number
of<00:06:06.280> commands<00:06:07.280> that<00:06:07.370> can<00:06:07.550> be<00:06:07.639> used<00:06:07.819> like<00:06:08.060> that

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
of commands that can be used like that

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.939 
of commands that can be used like that
for<00:06:08.629> doing<00:06:08.810> anything<00:06:09.110> from<00:06:09.319> throwing<00:06:09.710> the

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
for doing anything from throwing the

for doing anything from throwing the
headset<00:06:10.490> into<00:06:10.669> pairing<00:06:11.210> mode<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:11.569> actually

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
headset into pairing mode so actually

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.290 
headset into pairing mode so actually
turning<00:06:12.169> it<00:06:12.349> off<00:06:12.639> which<00:06:13.639> is<00:06:13.759> kind<00:06:14.060> of<00:06:14.120> cool

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
turning it off which is kind of cool

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.140 
turning it off which is kind of cool
it's<00:06:15.080> also<00:06:15.229> worth<00:06:15.469> noting<00:06:15.680> that<00:06:15.889> the<00:06:16.490> blue<00:06:17.000> and

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
it's also worth noting that the blue and

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.230 
it's also worth noting that the blue and
