the phantom menace and the subsequent

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.919 
the phantom menace and the subsequent
two<00:00:10.669> movies<00:00:10.969> were<00:00:11.329> the<00:00:12.369> backstory<00:00:13.369> for

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
two movies were the backstory for

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.200 
two movies were the backstory for
episodes<00:00:14.929> 4<00:00:15.230> 5<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:15.650> 6<00:00:15.860> and<00:00:16.130> because<00:00:16.790> I<00:00:16.880> wasn't

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
episodes 4 5 and 6 and because I wasn't

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.090 
episodes 4 5 and 6 and because I wasn't
going<00:00:17.450> to<00:00:17.540> make<00:00:17.630> it<00:00:17.690> into<00:00:17.990> movie<00:00:18.260> I<00:00:18.410> didn't

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
going to make it into movie I didn't

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.220 
going to make it into movie I didn't
write<00:00:19.370> it<00:00:19.430> in<00:00:19.760> order<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.240> fit<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.660> technology

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
write it in order to fit the technology

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.800 
write it in order to fit the technology
so<00:00:21.920> if<00:00:22.070> it<00:00:22.190> couldn't<00:00:22.400> be<00:00:22.580> made<00:00:22.790> and<00:00:23.090> now<00:00:23.540> that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
so if it couldn't be made and now that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.420 
so if it couldn't be made and now that
we<00:00:23.900> had<00:00:23.990> developed<00:00:24.140> digital<00:00:24.530> technology<00:00:25.280> by

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
we had developed digital technology by

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.750 
we had developed digital technology by
that<00:00:25.910> time<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.510> I<00:00:26.840> was<00:00:27.020> free<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.590> basically<00:00:28.520> do

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
that time and I was free to basically do

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.510 
that time and I was free to basically do
anything<00:00:28.940> I<00:00:29.360> wanted<00:00:29.690> I<00:00:29.870> was<00:00:30.289> able<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.920> go<00:00:31.460> to

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
anything I wanted I was able to go to

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.460 
anything I wanted I was able to go to
places<00:00:31.820> that<00:00:32.090> we<00:00:32.240> already<00:00:32.390> talked<00:00:32.900> about<00:00:33.230> in

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
places that we already talked about in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.590 
places that we already talked about in
the<00:00:33.530> last<00:00:34.160> three<00:00:34.550> movies<00:00:34.670> curse<00:00:35.120> on<00:00:35.420> the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
capital and the fact that they're aliens

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.340 
capital and the fact that they're aliens
everywhere<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:38.570> all<00:00:38.810> those<00:00:38.989> kind<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.260> things

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
that I had to put in a little tiny bar

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.090 
that I had to put in a little tiny bar
that<00:00:41.270> was<00:00:41.329> very<00:00:41.510> controlled<00:00:42.230> now<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.829> could

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
that was very controlled now I could

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.500 
that was very controlled now I could
open<00:00:43.310> up<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.640> world<00:00:43.880> and<00:00:44.060> have<00:00:44.150> aliens

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
open up the world and have aliens

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.160 
open up the world and have aliens
everywhere<00:00:44.810> I<00:00:45.850> love<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.000> story<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.899> love

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.750 
everywhere I love the story and I love
the<00:00:48.350> fact<00:00:48.500> i<00:00:48.680> was<00:00:48.829> able<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.160> tell<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.460> entire

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.710 
story of darth vader and i think it
really<00:00:52.040> rounds<00:00:52.550> out<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.000> whole<00:00:53.180> series<00:00:53.210> and

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
really rounds out the whole series and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.660 
really rounds out the whole series and
tells<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.410> full<00:00:54.590> story<00:00:54.950> of<00:00:55.070> what<00:00:55.190> happened

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
I think mmm what does that got to do

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.260 
I think mmm what does that got to do
with<00:01:12.770> anything<00:01:13.930> everything<00:01:15.970> fear<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
with anything everything fear is the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.410 
with anything everything fear is the
path<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.960> dark<00:01:18.290> side<00:01:19.030> fear<00:01:20.030> leads<00:01:20.060> to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
path to the dark side fear leads to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.980 
path to the dark side fear leads to
anger<00:01:20.510> anger<00:01:20.990> leads<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.799> hate<00:01:21.950> hate<00:01:22.340> leads<00:01:23.150> to

anger anger leads to hate hate leads to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.320 
anger anger leads to hate hate leads to
suffering<00:01:24.670> whenever<00:01:25.670> you're<00:01:25.850> at<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.150> leading

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
suffering whenever you're at the leading

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.180 
suffering whenever you're at the leading
edge<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.810> technology<00:01:27.049> there<00:01:27.740> are<00:01:27.799> things<00:01:28.040> that

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
edge of technology there are things that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.740 
edge of technology there are things that
you<00:01:28.369> try<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.820> do<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.299> can't<00:01:29.510> get<00:01:29.659> them

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
you try to do but you can't get them

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.020 
you try to do but you can't get them
done<00:01:29.930> either<00:01:30.650> for<00:01:31.070> lack<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.280> time<00:01:31.610> or<00:01:31.850> lack<00:01:32.000> of

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
money or lack of being able to advance

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.130 
money or lack of being able to advance
the<00:01:34.850> technology<00:01:34.970> where<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:35.600> need<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.990> go

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the technology where you need it to go

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.440 
the technology where you need it to go
and<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:36.619> was<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.070> genesis<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.939> going<00:01:38.240> back

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
and that was the genesis of going back

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.840 
and that was the genesis of going back
and<00:01:38.780> finishing<00:01:39.159> off<00:01:40.159> some<00:01:40.189> of<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.610> things

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
and finishing off some of the things

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.850 
and finishing off some of the things
that<00:01:40.970> were<00:01:41.150> half<00:01:41.360> finished<00:01:41.750> in<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.619> first

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that were half finished in the first

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.550 
that were half finished in the first
three<00:01:43.040> films<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:44.020> second<00:01:45.020> three<00:01:45.290> there's

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
three films the second three there's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.499 
three films the second three there's
very<00:01:45.830> little<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.280> because<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.270> fact

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
very little that because of the fact

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.999 
very little that because of the fact
that<00:01:47.659> I<00:01:47.750> had<00:01:47.930> more<00:01:48.110> time<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.530> more<00:01:48.619> money<00:01:48.830> and

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
that I had more time and more money and

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.070 
that I had more time and more money and
more<00:01:49.070> technology<00:01:49.369> they're<00:01:50.330> very<00:01:50.540> few<00:01:50.810> things

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
more technology they're very few things

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.560 
more technology they're very few things
that<00:01:51.320> actually<00:01:51.470> were<00:01:51.770> left<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.369> work<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.330> and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
that actually were left to work on and

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.469 
that actually were left to work on and
improve<00:01:54.049> one<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:55.009> them<00:01:55.189> that<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:55.939> did<00:01:56.119> improve

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
improve one of them that we did improve

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.179 
improve one of them that we did improve
was<00:01:56.750> what<00:01:56.930> we<00:01:57.110> were<00:01:57.200> trying<00:01:57.500> desperately<00:01:58.009> to

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
was what we were trying desperately to

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.179 
was what we were trying desperately to
get<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.579> digital<00:01:58.820> Yoda<00:01:59.299> into<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> first<00:02:00.530> film

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
get a digital Yoda into the first film

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.819 
get a digital Yoda into the first film
phantom<00:02:01.640> menace<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:02.110> just<00:02:03.110> couldn't<00:02:03.650> make<00:02:03.799> it

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
phantom menace we just couldn't make it

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.969 
phantom menace we just couldn't make it
work<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.299> came<00:02:05.450> close<00:02:05.479> we<00:02:06.079> got<00:02:06.200> jar<00:02:06.470> jar<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
work so we came close we got jar jar and

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.130 
work so we came close we got jar jar and
Sebulba<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.700> wat<00:02:08.330> oh<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.750> lot<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:08.959> other

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
Sebulba and wat oh and a lot of other

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.510 
Sebulba and wat oh and a lot of other
characters<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:09.890> couldn't<00:02:10.130> get<00:02:10.250> Yoda

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
characters but we couldn't get Yoda

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.720 
characters but we couldn't get Yoda
because<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.390> was<00:02:11.720> much<00:02:11.870> harder<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.290> do

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
because it was much harder to do

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.910 
because it was much harder to do
and<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.599> when<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.810> finally<00:02:14.200> did<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.739> that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and so when we finally did get it that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.800 
and so when we finally did get it that
accomplished<00:02:15.489> which<00:02:15.790> was<00:02:15.970> before<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.480> second

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
accomplished which was before the second

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.960 
accomplished which was before the second
film<00:02:17.049> we<00:02:17.530> went<00:02:17.709> back<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:17.980> put<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.610> digital

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
film we went back and put the digital

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.820 
film we went back and put the digital
Yoda<00:02:19.209> back<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.690> first<00:02:19.870> film<00:02:20.110> as<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.739> was

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
Yoda back in the first film as it was

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.770 
Yoda back in the first film as it was
intended<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.310> be<00:02:21.400> may<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> force<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.569> with<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.320 

the<00:02:27.650> second<00:02:27.980> trilogy<00:02:28.130> was<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.520> lot<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> fun<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the second trilogy was a lot of fun it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.790 
the second trilogy was a lot of fun it
was<00:02:29.540> challenging<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.410> were<00:02:30.530> pushing

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
was challenging and that we were pushing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.920 
was challenging and that we were pushing
the<00:02:31.010> boundaries<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.430> technology<00:02:32.090> but<00:02:32.270> that

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the boundaries of technology but that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.570 
the boundaries of technology but that
was<00:02:33.050> exciting<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.680> mean<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.069> were<00:02:34.100> doing<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> lot

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
was exciting I mean we were doing a lot

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.010 
was exciting I mean we were doing a lot
of<00:02:34.640> things<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.150> could<00:02:35.450> never<00:02:35.630> be<00:02:35.750> done

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
of things that could never be done

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.490 
of things that could never be done
before<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.940> moving<00:02:37.940> into<00:02:38.150> areas<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.569> we

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
before and moving into areas that we

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.230 
before and moving into areas that we
didn't<00:02:39.740> know<00:02:39.830> where<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:40.100> were<00:02:40.280> what<00:02:40.850> was<00:02:40.970> going

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
didn't know where we were what was going

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.479 
didn't know where we were what was going
on<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.690> was<00:02:42.380> fun<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.800> was<00:02:42.830> exciting<00:02:43.370> it

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
on and that was fun it was exciting it

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.069 
on and that was fun it was exciting it
was<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:44.140> exploration<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.590> unknown
