00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hi everybody 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.910
 chk and one goes out where the video falls with 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.940
 my custom classes for just one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.619
 thing that I will tell you first of all 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.980
 already it's thanks for 400 miles swallowed 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.480
 way and also if I do not have a clone of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 videos before shooting that's because I'm 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.029
 I'm asleep at 3 pm and I'm 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 asleep until 7am 8am 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.280
 today at the time when I turn this 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.200
 video of the coup I could not put the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.879
 public video was pressed all I 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.780
 wanted to put it in programming for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.520
 that she goes public can 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.750
 practically but I forgot to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.129
 do and suddenly and I fell asleep 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.570
 before so I'll do it to us we 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.520
 will go directly to a video with 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.059
 classes so already at my four 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.920
 first breaks and machine guns 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 simply there 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 usually it's just a name here 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.500
 I have my first three submachine gun 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 it is usually scrap 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
 different but with the same class 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 exactly it's silent and after 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.140
 it's not exactly m 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 same example pgw accessory I put a 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.030
 laser sight to aim finally without aiming 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.220
 actually it's easier to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 kill people faster then even 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 if I put look silly as it takes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.030
 too much time has changed and seen some 30 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.290
 low ball I use that and mp7 game but 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.460
 researcher great ability to have 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 fifty four balls what is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.509
 rather not bad I find 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 after for the assets it's the same crazy 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.909
 all and determination for could 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.799
 lightweight featherweight toughness looters 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.970
 and dexterity determination to have 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 but who would be that faster this 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.829
 neighborhood that quickly these 20% more 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.479
 fast so I prefer 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.759
 then he light weights to run over 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.229
 quickly end can only be one for 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.890
 get to the place more and less of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.110
 possible time 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.439
 that's what it is and why it is used 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.030
 for not having to not have 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.369
 damage when I jump from trÃ©auville 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.140
 just high enough and I 'm dying lighthouse done 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.520
 because of its robustness for when 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 I get shot on my face I do not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.439
 do not go anywhere and it stays at 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.500
 better for 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.539
 on the guy I'm aiming for if one of the trumps 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.220
 the most I use because the most 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.630
 I often do not wait until I use the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.180
 more often then stone for 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.640
 za retrieve ammunition is not 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.010
 complicated then dexterity to lift 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.410
 tears as quickly as possible for 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 do not get killed with all the lag and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.500
 all especially robustness and dexterity to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.560
 because of the lagoons I am obliged 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.450
 to use that then that's the class 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.660
 without silent where I put charaf quoted 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.730
 it can vary between pd wms mc and he 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.340
 I do not change course I put cannon 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.060
 no sooner that can vary between these 3 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.980
 mp 7 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 Here it is about 3 grapeshot 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.590
 that I use the most after I can 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.480
 change I can put the vector sometimes 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.930
 to be like that then my two classes 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.239
 with pumping and the n12 and the n118 70 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.400
 cm the two pumps that I like otherwise the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.830
 two others I do not really like what Jew 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.690
 it's too bad I do not really like it 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.790
 on this beach but that four to all 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.910
 I 'm featherweight determination and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.820
 stone to recover ammunition and 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 c4 and dexterity also for 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.780
 a tower the lag is separated for both 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.100
 I have a cape 40 since the shotgun 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.560
 to balls that disappear at the end 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.620
 of a certain reach and so I go 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.739
 prefer to use keep a weapon 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.950
 secondary with long reach 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.329
 then 3 3 classic assault rifle 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.400
 by the way there was the patch recently 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.340
 yesterday at 2 pm actually on pc 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.450
 so things are a little better 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.090
 gmail 27 there because I'm trying to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.069
 maximize the maximum level 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.090
 maximum prestige also just for the 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.400
 see like that because I 'm already going in 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.450
 diamonds then I have my but I like 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.069
 well the same end of set but I 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.810
 I will not use it I cross a cross 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.410
 I will have finished not so much anyway 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 after i have mascara ch always 3 3 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.720
 accessories for 6 also finished d are 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.220
 always three reindeer game accessories 27 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.290
 I use the same accessories as this 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.180
 who is paged a gnome me loader 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.799
 fast and legal cross 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.239
 finally sometimes I use these classes there 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.530
 without a quick charger but with a 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.470
 silent if I find myself anymore 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.819
 silent but these are the handles 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.180
 ergonomic to be able to aim more 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.489
 quick 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.459
 there is a video that I saw or when 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:21.049
 ages a little faster when aimed 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.910
 bullets were not at the same point 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.050
 that the aim was actually enough at 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.610
 us but basically it's a legacy or the 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.690
 brooms and it's always like we 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.700
 did not do while we are in the process of 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.460
 10 and even though the so-called patch 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.110
 fix it so I would have to test 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.310
 I have not tested yet besides I'm going 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.650
 test without but generally I do you 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.690
 cling adjustable it's to have 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.560
 a cracking effect actually to move 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.300
 faster than ambient and charger 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.680
 fast was probably doing the classes 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.910
 and tonnages hambourg the strokes 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.800
 kortrijk still the same 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.510
 pierrot but this one has just 6 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.180
 37 years old then dexterity 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.250
 then my sniper class or other class 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.690
 weapon that I never get old and 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.660
 sniper because I'm trying to get them 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.750
 I finally know too just in Africa 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.370
 I do it I play with then there is y'a 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.450
 not too invisible if I take 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.240
 scores strict determination and 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.370
 robustness to not make me that you 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.660
 say this bar in the body of a body I'm told 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.280
 then dexterity to aim a little more 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.200
 than that to ballistics since I like 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.090
 well when that moves what then integrates 45 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.099
 for when the guys are a little too much 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.680
 near well h2 fight just for the 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.870
 like that in case and crippling sees 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.280
 the soldier - by the way, but here it is 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.820
 pretty much everything for my classes was 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.849
 quite fast 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.070
 I repeat to you that I did not think so 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.300
 here I am carrache worry n 94 of 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.950
 weapons that I like very much even 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.500
 if gasket redemption a decline enough 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.020
 important generally I will put the fal 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.160
 automatic on with I show what 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.000
 I will use with the automatic fal 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.000
 with handles 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:54.330
 cros and deezer scanner e fhf that is 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.810
 for me a vip stayed because that 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.690
 often do that it's a often in 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.889
 better than we can see in 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.330
 through the walls that is pretty good 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.009
 when the guys do not move it's really 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.240
 really very much this case I hope that 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.070
 the video will have pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.180
 leave a I like I post it because 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.100
 I wanted to ask without embarrassment about the 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.880
 video of my stats it's you take off 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.070
 the myths 200 and some 280 253 this 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.389
 which is crazy enough but the genres 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.440
 surprised by putting m 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.520
 I'm going to fall in love 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.139
 since I have hyper end moreover 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.639
 I hope in any case the anyway that 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.870
 the video will have pleased you with that you will have 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.759
 helped me personally it's with the 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.770
 what I can do 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.289
 that's all that's what I use 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.090
 most of the time these guns 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.889
 when I was in them is not too much 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.240
 steep great map here is anyway 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.229
 I hope that tomorrow more again 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.229
 barge
