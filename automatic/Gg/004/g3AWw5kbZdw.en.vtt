I'm DJ Poye, professional Jeweler and Gemologist,
and I am here today on behalf of Expert Village.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.480
Hi, we're back again, so we're moving forward
with the piece here. We did the mark on the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.939
back, and now what you do is a process of
eliminating smaller scratches and getting

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:23.980
the piece to where its more fine tuned to
do the tripling, which is removing the abrasions,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.559
smaller scratches with a compound, and then
the rouge. So it's a series of stages that

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.940
we have to move through in order to get through
the tripling into the ruse, into the rouge.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.460
So the next wheel we'll do is a radial disc
wheel that places a small light texture on

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.800
the piece, and gives the piece the same texture
on both front and back. It also smooths the

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.050
pieces out, removes any extra shavings that
have come off when you're doing the piercing.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.100
And also fine tunes the lines around the sides
of the piece from the piercing as well. So

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.899
we'll begin. Okay, I usually start, you want
to make sure that the brush is going the same

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.039
way as the wheel. You don't want to have the
brush go the opposite way. You would never

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:17.399
be able to brush anything. So I hold the piece
very tight in my hand, and I actually secure

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.939
from that side. And I just do a circular motion
with the piece. Okay, and try not to push

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.119
too hard down on the piece. Basically because
you don't want to indent the piece with intense

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.749
abrasions. Again, you just want to lightly
go across it. And as you tell, the piece has

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.439
now more of a frosted look, a more smoother
look. We're going to do the other side too.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.549
You don't need to do this very much. All this
basically does is bring the piece into more

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.749
of a matte texture and really just gives it
kind of a nice texture to hold to as well.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:03.002
I also do the sides a little bit. Once again,
kind of pressing again hard on it, but I also

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:07.029
hold the piece very securely. You don't want
the piece to be coming out of your hand. That's

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:13.400
why you always want to make sure you're wear
your glasses, or your safety glasses. Okay,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.520
alright. Because these buffing wheels can
move at high RPMs. But I just had to go in

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.580
between these little areas here, and you can
see that the abrasions or the scratch marks

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:43.680
from the blade are getting more smooth. Once
again, when we go through these stages, it's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:58.733
a process of bringing the raw metal into its
pure form. And there you have it. It's got

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:03.090
a frosted look on both sides but it's getting
to where its starting to really, really feel

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.310
smooth. There you go.
