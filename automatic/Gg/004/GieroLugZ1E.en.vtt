00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
if there's such a thing that he didn't

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.930 
if there's such a thing that he didn't
think<00:05:11.240> so<00:05:11.570> don't<00:05:11.630> blame<00:05:12.110> him

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.550 

in<00:05:18.940> Germany<00:05:19.360> when<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.600> one<00:05:19.840> boxer<00:05:20.230> is<00:05:20.350> from

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
in Germany when the one boxer is from

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.260 
in Germany when the one boxer is from
outside<00:05:20.770> Germany<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.700> counts<00:05:22.030> are<00:05:22.090> done

outside Germany of the counts are done
in<00:05:22.419> English<00:05:22.510> anyway<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:25.570> I<00:05:25.600> assumed<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:26.620> the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
in English anyway so I assumed that the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.650 
in English anyway so I assumed that the
Belgium<00:05:27.190> would<00:05:27.280> know<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.490> nice<00:05:28.419> little

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
Belgium would know that nice little

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.810 
Belgium would know that nice little
defensive<00:05:29.260> move<00:05:29.530> I<00:05:29.830> think<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.250> body<00:05:30.430> shots

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
defensive move I think the body shots

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.550 
defensive move I think the body shots
that<00:05:31.000> when<00:05:31.150> they<00:05:31.240> see<00:05:31.419> him<00:05:31.510> on<00:05:31.630> telly<00:05:31.870> off<00:05:32.050> he's

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.440 
that when they see him on telly off he's
he's<00:05:33.070> not<00:05:33.280> gonna<00:05:33.370> hang<00:05:33.550> around<00:05:33.580> on<00:05:34.060> this<00:05:34.210> bad

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450
