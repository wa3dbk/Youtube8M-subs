00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.119
 hello how are today we are going to recycle 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:36.890
 these cans of tuna to make a nice 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.560
 Locked or jewelery or chest for 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.390
 save jewelry as you want it 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.300
 to call 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.870
 we will need for this job 4 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.760
 cans I did it with 4 cans you what 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.220
 can do with 3 with 2 or more cans 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.890
 once we have the latita let's go 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.329
 to look for old viscera like these 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.839
 that we have to have 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.790
 the little hole that we're going to need 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.770
 once we are going to measure from here here and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.920
 let's cut 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.080
 I cut it with a hot knife 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.320
 this way once we're going to paste in 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.770
 all the little plate we are going to paste from this 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 shape 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.080
 and so we're going to stick the tube because the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.130
 idea is that after we get between a stick 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.469
 of brochette 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.469
 must enter in this way 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.470
 once we have them like that I'm going to 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.350
 show me I bought myself a very cute paper 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.510
 this paper has adhesive on this side 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.330
 If we remove it, it has adhesive 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.800
 is to paste is called here in my country 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.110
 we call it paper contact 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.160
 I'm going to line 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.710
 all my little can with this paper here cut 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.500
 a strip 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.410
 is with which I will cover all the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.260
 latita 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.220
 you can do this work with 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 Fabric can also be lined with fabric 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.510
 that is very nice 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.120
 let's go over 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.330
 in this way and we are going to press 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.330
 so that it goes well 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.530
 if you want you can paint the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.560
 inside I left it like this 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.270
 once so we are also going to cut this 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.270
 surplus from up here 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.160
 This is a super easy job to do 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.890
 and we are recycling tuna cans 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.930
 that most of the time we throw it 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.080
 in this case we are going to make a nice 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.150
 He praised jeweler or as you want 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.640
 call it once we have the tin 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.640
 so I'm going to show you that they already have 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.459
 the most advanced work I already have closed 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.770
 all the other little cans once I 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.770
 we have so I'm going to show you that 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.600
 I also have the cap 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.200
 these are the caps that bring the 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.550
 tuna legs would be like this that I 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.630
 I left it well ready and then run it with 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.820
 the same paper and I put a few tips 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:22.310
 To decorate it, I stuck some nails 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.850
 as you see here once we have the 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.490
 four cans 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.020
 erased 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.740
 and also the cap 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.740
 let's grab a stick of brooches a 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.659
 wire or what you have at home 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.810
 and we're going to put our Latinas 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.510
 for the pens that you 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.530
 we put 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.530
 thus 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.010
 if you want they can cover the 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.300
 hole that is down here so that 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.300
 the stick does not pass 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.390
 once we already have it this way 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.630
 shape 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.630
 let's put what is the capita 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.289
 once so 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.480
 let's cut the surplus that remains 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.000
 of the stick we are going to cut 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.420
 I will also show you that I have some 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.180
 little florets that I made with the wide teach 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.450
 how to make these little flowers I'm going to 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.450
 paste to decorate it a little 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.670
 I'm also going to beat Latinas 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.000
 ah 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:16.530
 and that's how my tuna talks will be 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:19.470
 recycled in these ways I'm going to 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.690
 show this is the cap 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.640
 as I told you earlier you the 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.540
 you can paint if you want inside or 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:32.010
 line once so they are moving to 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:38.330
 to be able to open it in this way 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:43.969
 moving it the little cans and they can be opened 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:46.699
 then back together and close 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.610
 and this is a nice loop that we can 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:52.819
 give our daughters to our 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:57.080
 nieces to our sisters to our 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:59.780
 mom to our teacher 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.050
 I hope you liked my work 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.590
