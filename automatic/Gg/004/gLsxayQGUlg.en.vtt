welcome to home campus comm dot as G
here's<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.400> word<00:00:05.609> problem<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.930> says

here's a word problem for you it says

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.240 
here's a word problem for you it says
that<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.560> dictionary<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.460> three<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.450> one-third

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
that a dictionary is three and one-third

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.910 
that a dictionary is three and one-third
centimeters<00:00:11.250> thick<00:00:11.519> find<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.660> height<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
centimeters thick find the height of the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.970 
centimeters thick find the height of the
stack<00:00:14.190> made<00:00:14.730> by<00:00:15.000> twenty<00:00:15.870> such<00:00:16.199> dictionaries

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
stack made by twenty such dictionaries

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.359 
stack made by twenty such dictionaries
when<00:00:17.520> placed<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.180> top<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.539> each<00:00:19.140> other<00:00:19.380> okay<00:00:20.310> so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
when placed on top of each other okay so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.120 
when placed on top of each other okay so
it's<00:00:21.090> saying<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> dictionary

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it's saying that there is a dictionary

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.130 
it's saying that there is a dictionary
that<00:00:23.760> has<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> height<00:00:24.420> or<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that has a height or actually a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.470 
that has a height or actually a
thickness<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.949> three<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> one-third

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
thickness of three and one-third

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.290 
thickness of three and one-third
centimeters<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.310> if<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> supposed<00:00:30.060> how<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
centimeters so if this is supposed how a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
centimeters so if this is supposed how a
dictionary<00:00:30.900> looks<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.470> okay<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:31.949> gonna<00:00:32.070> try

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
dictionary looks like okay I'm gonna try

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.850 
dictionary looks like okay I'm gonna try
to<00:00:32.430> show<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.420> gonna<00:00:33.570> try<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> draw<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to show it I'm gonna try to draw it and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.459 
to show it I'm gonna try to draw it and
show<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> thickness<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
show to you what the thickness of a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.369 
show to you what the thickness of a
dictionary<00:00:37.620> means<00:00:38.100> okay<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
dictionary means okay so if this is a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.110 
dictionary means okay so if this is a
dictionary<00:00:40.800> something<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:45.230> okay

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
dictionary something like this okay

something like this then this is the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
something like this then this is the
thickness<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> dictionary<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.710> over

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
thickness of the dictionary this over

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.810 
thickness of the dictionary this over
here<00:00:53.399> okay<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.399> the

something like this okay there is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
something like this okay there is
another<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.890> over<00:01:44.310> here

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.760 

you're<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.210> last<00:01:52.390> one<00:01:52.810> on<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.020> top<00:01:53.320> okay

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
you're the last one on the top okay

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.660 
you're the last one on the top okay
something<00:01:54.160> like<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:59.220> so<00:02:00.220> there's<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.460> whole

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
something like this so there's a whole

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.910 
something like this so there's a whole
stack<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.090> 20<00:02:01.630> dictionaries<00:02:02.080> okay<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:02.860> you

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
stack of 20 dictionaries okay now you

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.000 
stack of 20 dictionaries okay now you
have<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.280> find<00:02:03.670> out<00:02:03.940> what<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.840> height<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.470> the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
have to find out what the height of the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.990 
have to find out what the height of the
stack<00:02:06.280> would<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.330> from<00:02:07.630> here<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:08.320> here

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
stack would be that is from here to here

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.850 
stack would be that is from here to here
how<00:02:10.000> tall<00:02:10.480> would<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.780> be<00:02:10.930> actually<00:02:11.470> it's<00:02:11.770> quite

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
how tall would it be actually it's quite

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.190 
how tall would it be actually it's quite
simple<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.400> height<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.970> would<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.330> 3<00:02:13.990> and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
simple the height of this would be 3 and

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.000 
simple the height of this would be 3 and
1/3<00:02:14.920> centimeters<00:02:15.700> times<00:02:16.360> 20<00:02:17.140> because<00:02:17.560> each

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
1/3 centimeters times 20 because each

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.800 
1/3 centimeters times 20 because each
dictionary<00:02:18.550> has<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.820> height<00:02:19.150> or<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> thickness

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
dictionary has a height or a thickness

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.380 
dictionary has a height or a thickness
of<00:02:20.200> 3<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.680> 1/3<00:02:21.190> centimeters<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.030> there<00:02:22.270> are

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
of 3 and 1/3 centimeters and there are

of them is to split this mixed fraction
into<00:03:36.940> its<00:03:37.090> whole<00:03:37.390> number<00:03:37.690> part<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
into its whole number part and the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.620 
into its whole number part and the
fractional<00:03:38.350> part<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.340> then<00:03:39.850> multiply<00:03:40.330> each

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
fractional part and then multiply each

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.560 
fractional part and then multiply each
of<00:03:40.660> them<00:03:41.140> by<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.830> number<00:03:42.370> 20<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.180> then<00:03:43.390> add

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
of them by this number 20 and then add

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.660 
of them by this number 20 and then add
the<00:03:43.750> two<00:03:43.900> products<00:03:44.380> okay<00:03:44.860> which<00:03:45.250> would<00:03:45.459> mean

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
the two products okay which would mean

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.470 
the two products okay which would mean
that<00:03:45.730> what<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.680> split<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:48.480> into

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
that what you do is you split this into

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.610 
that what you do is you split this into
three<00:03:49.989> plus<00:03:50.700> one-third<00:03:51.700> okay<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.620> you

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
three plus one-third okay and you

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.970 
three plus one-third okay and you
multiply<00:03:54.250> each<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.970> these<00:03:55.360> by<00:03:55.420> 20<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.440> 3<00:03:56.680> times

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
multiply each of these by 20 so 3 times

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.680 
multiply each of these by 20 so 3 times
20<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.489> equal<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.420> 60<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.820> one-third<00:04:00.820> times<00:04:01.150> 20

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
20 is equal to 60 and one-third times 20

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.130 
20 is equal to 60 and one-third times 20
is<00:04:01.720> 20<00:04:02.590> upon<00:04:02.920> 3<00:04:03.250> now<00:04:03.910> so

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
is 20 upon 3 now so

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.620 
is 20 upon 3 now so
this<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.620> an<00:04:04.800> improper<00:04:05.370> fraction<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:06.390> can

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
this is an improper fraction you can

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.220 
this is an improper fraction you can
again<00:04:07.140> change<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.850> mixed<00:04:09.540> number<00:04:09.720> right

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
again change it to a mixed number right

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.090 
again change it to a mixed number right
20<00:04:10.740> upon<00:04:11.040> 3<00:04:11.340> means<00:04:11.580> 20<00:04:12.090> divided<00:04:12.600> by<00:04:12.630> 3<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.319> 21

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
20 upon 3 means 20 divided by 3 and 21

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.020 
20 upon 3 means 20 divided by 3 and 21
divided<00:04:14.670> by<00:04:14.819> 3<00:04:15.150> gives<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.630> 6<00:04:15.959> here<00:04:16.290> okay<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
divided by 3 gives you 6 here okay and a

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.190 
divided by 3 gives you 6 here okay and a
remainder<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.720> 2<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.489> 21<00:04:20.489> 3<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:21.750> equal

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
remainder of 2 so 21 3 is actually equal

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.480

to<00:04:22.260> 6<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.419> 2/3<00:04:24.419> now<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.680> again<00:04:25.950> equal<00:04:26.340> to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
to 6 and 2/3 now this is again equal to

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.409 
to 6 and 2/3 now this is again equal to
60<00:04:26.910> plus<00:04:27.270> 6<00:04:27.630> plus<00:04:27.900> 2/3<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.890> now<00:04:29.100> 60<00:04:29.640> plus<00:04:29.940> 6<00:04:30.210> is

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
60 plus 6 plus 2/3 and now 60 plus 6 is

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.430 
60 plus 6 plus 2/3 and now 60 plus 6 is
66<00:04:31.230> Plus<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.460> fraction<00:04:33.030> 2/3<00:04:33.540> okay<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.290> this

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
66 Plus this fraction 2/3 okay and this

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.790 
66 Plus this fraction 2/3 okay and this
we<00:04:34.620> know<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:35.040> equal<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.820> mixed<00:04:36.300> fraction

is<00:04:43.680> 66<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.640> 2/3<00:04:45.570> centimeters<00:04:46.140> that's<00:04:46.590> what<00:04:46.860> 3

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
is 66 and 2/3 centimeters that's what 3

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.159 
is 66 and 2/3 centimeters that's what 3
and<00:04:47.280> 1/3<00:04:47.550> centimeters<00:04:48.120> times<00:04:48.330> 20<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.780> equal<00:04:49.080> to

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
and 1/3 centimeters times 20 is equal to

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.890 
and 1/3 centimeters times 20 is equal to
or<00:04:49.350> if<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.370> want<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> use<00:04:51.360> another

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
or if you want you can use another

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.990 
or if you want you can use another
method<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.500> multiplying<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.460> okay

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
method of multiplying this okay

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.080 
method of multiplying this okay
multiplying<00:04:54.630> three<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.290> one<00:04:55.530> thirds<00:04:55.830> by<00:04:56.400> 20

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
multiplying three and one thirds by 20

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.760 
multiplying three and one thirds by 20
so<00:04:57.570> what<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.840> do<00:04:57.960> is<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.200> take<00:04:58.380> three<00:04:58.740> and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
so what you do is you take three and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.640 
so what you do is you take three and
one-third<00:04:59.340> centimeters<00:05:00.330> okay<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.530> know

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
one-third centimeters okay and you know

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.400 
one-third centimeters okay and you know
you<00:05:01.710> wanna<00:05:01.980> do<00:05:02.190> 8<00:05:02.340> times<00:05:02.520> 20<00:05:03.120> now<00:05:03.750> what<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.260> can

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
you wanna do 8 times 20 now what you can

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.280 
you wanna do 8 times 20 now what you can
do<00:05:04.650> is<00:05:04.890> you<00:05:05.220> convert<00:05:05.520> this<00:05:06.390> guy<00:05:06.870> which<00:05:07.140> is<00:05:07.169> a

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
do is you convert this guy which is a

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.340 
do is you convert this guy which is a
mixed<00:05:07.620> fraction<00:05:07.880> into<00:05:08.880> an<00:05:09.169> improper<00:05:10.169> fraction

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
mixed fraction into an improper fraction

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.940 
mixed fraction into an improper fraction
so<00:05:11.190> 3<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.790> 1/3<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.450> equal<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.050> what<00:05:13.229> well<00:05:13.440> 3<00:05:13.770> &amp;<00:05:13.919> 1

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
so 3 and 1/3 is equal to what well 3 &amp; 1

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.670 
so 3 and 1/3 is equal to what well 3 &amp; 1
thirds<00:05:14.340> means<00:05:14.669> 3<00:05:15.030> times<00:05:15.360> 3<00:05:15.690> this<00:05:16.260> whole<00:05:16.560> number

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
thirds means 3 times 3 this whole number

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.930 
thirds means 3 times 3 this whole number
three<00:05:17.040> times<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.850> denominator<00:05:18.510> 3<00:05:18.930> ok<00:05:19.830> plus<00:05:20.460> 1

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
three times this denominator 3 ok plus 1

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.890 
three times this denominator 3 ok plus 1
upon<00:05:21.390> 3<00:05:22.020> plus<00:05:22.800> 1<00:05:23.010> comes<00:05:23.340> from<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:24.240> numerator

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
upon 3 plus 1 comes from this numerator

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.760 
upon 3 plus 1 comes from this numerator
okay<00:05:25.200> and<00:05:25.620> upon<00:05:26.250> 3<00:05:26.640> the<00:05:26.880> denominator<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.870> then

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
okay and upon 3 the denominator and then

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
okay and upon 3 the denominator and then
you<00:05:29.040> do<00:05:29.250> times<00:05:29.640> 20<00:05:30.270> now<00:05:30.900> 3<00:05:31.290> times<00:05:31.710> 3<00:05:32.010> is<00:05:32.130> 9<00:05:32.370> plus

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
you do times 20 now 3 times 3 is 9 plus

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.070 
you do times 20 now 3 times 3 is 9 plus
1<00:05:33.540> is<00:05:33.780> 10<00:05:33.870> so<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.740> is<00:05:34.800> 10<00:05:34.979> upon<00:05:35.550> 3<00:05:35.850> times<00:05:36.540> 20

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
1 is 10 so this is 10 upon 3 times 20

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.070 
1 is 10 so this is 10 upon 3 times 20
and<00:05:37.169> 10<00:05:37.830> upon<00:05:38.190> 3<00:05:38.460> times<00:05:38.700> 20<00:05:39.120> means<00:05:39.330> 10<00:05:39.630> upon<00:05:39.870> 3

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
and 10 upon 3 times 20 means 10 upon 3

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.620 
and 10 upon 3 times 20 means 10 upon 3
times<00:05:40.350> 20<00:05:40.830> upon<00:05:41.070> 1<00:05:41.250> so<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:41.760> do<00:05:41.940> 10<00:05:42.150> times<00:05:42.330> 20

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
times 20 upon 1 so you do 10 times 20

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.850 
times 20 upon 1 so you do 10 times 20
and<00:05:42.960> 3<00:05:43.350> times<00:05:43.560> 1<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:44.250> 10<00:05:44.460> times<00:05:44.610> 20<00:05:45.090> is<00:05:45.229> 200<00:05:46.229> upon

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
and 3 times 1 so 10 times 20 is 200 upon

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.070 
and 3 times 1 so 10 times 20 is 200 upon
3<00:05:47.100> times<00:05:47.340> 1<00:05:47.550> is<00:05:47.760> 3<00:05:47.960> so<00:05:48.960> you<00:05:49.320> get<00:05:49.669> 200<00:05:50.669> 1<00:05:51.600> 3

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
3 times 1 is 3 so you get 200 1 3

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.770 
3 times 1 is 3 so you get 200 1 3
centimeters<00:05:52.950> that's<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.460> height<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:54.120> stack

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
centimeters that's the height the stack

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.330 
centimeters that's the height the stack
but<00:05:55.200> it<00:05:55.350> doesn't<00:05:55.620> make<00:05:55.740> much<00:05:55.979> sense<00:05:56.010> right

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
but it doesn't make much sense right

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.520 
but it doesn't make much sense right
what<00:05:56.669> is<00:05:56.789> 200<00:05:57.330> upon<00:05:57.600> 3<00:05:57.810> that's<00:05:57.930> an<00:05:58.110> improper

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
what is 200 upon 3 that's an improper

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.990 
what is 200 upon 3 that's an improper
fraction<00:05:58.560> doesn't<00:05:59.190> make<00:05:59.310> much<00:05:59.490> sense<00:05:59.520> so

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
fraction doesn't make much sense so

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.340 
fraction doesn't make much sense so
let's<00:06:00.690> convert<00:06:01.020> this<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.950> a<00:06:02.220> mixed<00:06:02.940> fraction

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
by the denominator which is 3 now

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.790 
by the denominator which is 3 now
when<00:06:17.939> you<00:06:18.059> divide<00:06:18.300> 200<00:06:18.929> by<00:06:19.050> 3<00:06:19.319> what<00:06:19.469> you<00:06:19.559> get

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
when you divide 200 by 3 what you get

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.989 
when you divide 200 by 3 what you get
well<00:06:20.249> you<00:06:20.279> get<00:06:20.580> 6<00:06:20.939> here<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:21.740> 18<00:06:22.740> here<00:06:23.129> and<00:06:23.580> you

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:23.999 
well you get 6 here and 18 here and you

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:25.850 
well you get 6 here and 18 here and you
get<00:06:24.149> 2<00:06:24.330> as<00:06:24.449> a<00:06:24.479> remainder<00:06:24.839> you<00:06:25.139> bring<00:06:25.439> down<00:06:25.589> the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
get 2 as a remainder you bring down the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.329 
get 2 as a remainder you bring down the
0<00:06:26.129> and<00:06:26.639> then<00:06:27.149> you<00:06:27.300> get<00:06:27.449> another<00:06:27.599> 6<00:06:28.169> here<00:06:28.439> 18

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:29.339 
0 and then you get another 6 here 18

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.480 
0 and then you get another 6 here 18
here<00:06:29.729> and<00:06:30.029> 2<00:06:30.959> as<00:06:31.139> a<00:06:31.169> remainder<00:06:31.529> so<00:06:32.009> this<00:06:32.219> is

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
here and 2 as a remainder so this is

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:39.320 
here and 2 as a remainder so this is
equal<00:06:32.999> to<00:06:33.149> 66<00:06:33.869> ok<00:06:34.619> this<00:06:35.009> 66<00:06:35.639> and<00:06:37.129> 2<00:06:38.129> upon<00:06:38.580> 3<00:06:38.879> this

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
equal to 66 ok this 66 and 2 upon 3 this

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.449 
equal to 66 ok this 66 and 2 upon 3 this
to<00:06:39.539> the<00:06:39.689> numerator<00:06:40.080> here<00:06:40.409> comes<00:06:41.069> from<00:06:41.339> the

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:41.459 
to the numerator here comes from the

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.579 
to the numerator here comes from the
remainder<00:06:41.909> and<00:06:42.089> this<00:06:42.389> 3<00:06:42.689> is<00:06:43.020> actually<00:06:43.469> the

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
remainder and this 3 is actually the

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:45.230 
remainder and this 3 is actually the
number<00:06:43.889> 3<00:06:44.159> that<00:06:44.369> you're<00:06:44.550> dividing<00:06:44.789> it<00:06:45.059> by

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
number 3 that you're dividing it by

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.109 
number 3 that you're dividing it by
which<00:06:45.689> is<00:06:45.899> the<00:06:46.020> denominator<00:06:46.699> so<00:06:47.699> you<00:06:47.759> figured

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:48.119 
which is the denominator so you figured

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.079 
which is the denominator so you figured
out<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.479> 200<00:06:49.050> upon<00:06:49.439> 3<00:06:49.770> centimeters<00:06:50.459> is<00:06:50.669> really

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:51.089 
out the 200 upon 3 centimeters is really

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.919 
out the 200 upon 3 centimeters is really
equal<00:06:51.449> to<00:06:51.629> 66<00:06:52.319> and<00:06:52.729> 2/3<00:06:53.729> centimeters<00:06:54.539> which<00:06:54.899> is

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:54.929 
equal to 66 and 2/3 centimeters which is

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:57.259 
equal to 66 and 2/3 centimeters which is
also<00:06:55.319> the<00:06:55.529> same<00:06:55.919> as<00:06:56.219> what<00:06:56.459> we<00:06:56.639> had<00:06:56.789> found<00:06:57.059> out

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:57.269 
also the same as what we had found out

00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:58.909 
also the same as what we had found out
here<00:06:57.569> using<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.169> other<00:06:58.289> method<00:06:58.439> so<00:06:58.830> it

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
here using the other method so it

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.739 
here using the other method so it
doesn't<00:06:59.159> matter<00:06:59.279> which<00:06:59.550> method<00:06:59.699> you<00:06:59.969> use<00:06:59.999> but

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:00.749 
doesn't matter which method you use but

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:02.089 
doesn't matter which method you use but
I<00:07:00.779> personally<00:07:01.169> prefer<00:07:01.559> the<00:07:01.679> second<00:07:01.979> method

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 
I personally prefer the second method

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.309 
I personally prefer the second method
because<00:07:02.490> it's<00:07:02.639> much<00:07:02.819> straightforward<00:07:03.319> anyway

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
because it's much straightforward anyway

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.149 
because it's much straightforward anyway
so<00:07:04.379> 66<00:07:05.219> and<00:07:05.429> 2/3<00:07:06.119> centimeters<00:07:06.869> is<00:07:07.139> the<00:07:07.889> height

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159 
so 66 and 2/3 centimeters is the height

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:10.429 
so 66 and 2/3 centimeters is the height
of<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.759> stack<00:07:09.059> made<00:07:09.449> by<00:07:09.689> 20<00:07:10.199> such
