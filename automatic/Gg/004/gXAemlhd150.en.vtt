00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:30.290 
still cuz his head's at quite an angle
isn't<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.090> what<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:28.940> also<00:02:29.940> look

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
isn't it do you know what I also look

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.330 
isn't it do you know what I also look
for<00:02:30.540> him<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:31.020> could<00:02:31.200> maybe<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> little<00:02:31.740> bit

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
for him it could maybe be a little bit

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
for him it could maybe be a little bit
closer<00:02:33.200> yeah<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:35.150> think<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.510> don't<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
closer yeah I think I don't think the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.320 
closer yeah I think I don't think the
ball<00:02:37.350> too<00:02:37.710> far<00:02:38.040> away<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.580> he's<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.970> played

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
ball too far away if he's just played

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.229 
ball too far away if he's just played

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
mm-hmm a lot in line a line yet but yeah

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.790 
mm-hmm a lot in line a line yet but yeah
a<00:02:45.570> little<00:02:46.500> bit<00:02:46.620> closer<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
a little bit closer is that not to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:59.360 
a little bit closer is that not to
