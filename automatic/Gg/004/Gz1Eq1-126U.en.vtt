00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.949
 calling to renegotiate the contract I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.279
 contract I renegotiate them once to the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.289

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.169

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.820

 Christian is 63 years old grandson and belly 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.800
 because they want us then I think 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.989
 that by removing something that takes so many years 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.810
 forming being a pillar of a chain is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 a serious mistake and still what has been the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.280
 reaction that have the same affection that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.030
