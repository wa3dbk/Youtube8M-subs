00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.740
 I used 2 pounds of shrimp already cleaned 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.900
 and we are going to put them to boil and once 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.300
 that these change color of this 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 way 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.619
 we remove them from the fire and the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.130
 we separate from the water so that they stop 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.860
 cook eye do not throw the water because the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.250
 let's use later 4 tomatoes 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.480

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.430
 two peeled cucumbers of which we are going 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.100

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.649
 three lemons salt to taste quite katsu 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.009
