00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.210
 keeps convicting 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.030
 The profi teaches here three days 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.090

 that was great try that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:43.360
 Emil is a natural one standard 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.130
 clock on the bass drum and the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.850
 small drum is for emil one 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.850
 child's play 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.770
 thomas is not astonished what is 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.610
 one important thing is that it is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.959
 I do not know yet but it is quite 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.659
 important if you play drums 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.340
 you have to always have in mind 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.890
 That's what makes him one more 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.870
 better drummer the tips of the professional 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.750
 finger the young drummer super 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
 but emil was particularly impressed 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.180
 the instrument with the eightfold 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.180
 plaster machine 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.090
 thomas's drums so cool because 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.160
 It has so many pedals and many come 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.470
 practicing tricks on the tricky stick 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.390
 the opportunity in the pro musician 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.270
 to ask personal questions 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.740
 since when blow I shows games since 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.870
 my fourth year of life 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.090
 my brother has an arrow and a bow 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.670
 and I just have his arrows 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.420
 stolen from the arrow and bow 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.700
 split apart in the middle 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.950
 I have two short strength with those 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.000
 I started getting around 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.010
 all sorts of pots and pans and 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.010
 my mother so annoyed so far so far 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.210
 Okay, now I have a drumset 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.550
 Teach me and teach me 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.430
 You can play skillfully drums 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.630
 either teach you yourself or 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.280
 take lessons and then at one 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.800
 to study music college 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.960
 the main prerequisites talent 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.960
 Effortlessness and agility 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.250
 just to learn the four 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.940
 limb a bit independent too 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.160
 move 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.660
 game sometimes you have just a 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.300
 right hand on the thighs behind 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.010
 on the right and on the right and on the right 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.990
 then rammed left so fast 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.320
 drums can ever get out of hand 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.320
 come 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.859
 is at my main station splinter 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.599
 cell hoppala on stage too me 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.700
 Hoppalas happen on stage all the time 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.590
 I think that happens to every musician 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.209
 many have happened to me and it has happened 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.709
 also happens again and again I am to 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.700
 For example, once before on a stage 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.859
 broken into 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.359
 but the worst hoppalas are the 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.650
 if you forget the music when you are 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.510
 Forgets to import this 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.609
 if you blame yourself and that's him 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.079
 embarrassing today but everything is like 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.450
 ran in a hurry 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.519
 After his meeting with Thomas will be in 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.969
 future probably a bit louder 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.969
 drums
