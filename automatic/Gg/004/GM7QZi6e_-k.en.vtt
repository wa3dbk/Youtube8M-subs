that it has a built-in microphone so you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.950

less so you're getting more power for
less<00:00:49.110> weight<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.070> sets<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.579> system

less weight what really sets this system

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
less weight what really sets this system
apart<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> amount<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> channels<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> has
