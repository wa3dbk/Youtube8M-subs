yeah<00:00:04.069> I<00:00:04.100> think<00:00:04.279> he<00:00:04.640> will<00:00:05.330> endure<00:00:05.510> what<00:00:05.630> lessons

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
yeah I think he will endure what lessons

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.900 
yeah I think he will endure what lessons
for<00:00:06.109> it<00:00:06.230> where<00:00:06.410> we're<00:00:07.250> in<00:00:07.399> a<00:00:07.430> tournament<00:00:07.849> like

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
for it where we're in a tournament like

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.240 
for it where we're in a tournament like
this<00:00:08.000> shifter<00:00:08.920> switching<00:00:09.920> mines<00:00:10.099> pretty

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
this shifter switching mines pretty

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.670 
this shifter switching mines pretty
quickly<00:00:10.640> and<00:00:11.020> we<00:00:12.020> all<00:00:12.110> set<00:00:12.350> and<00:00:12.440> watch<00:00:12.530> the

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
quickly and we all set and watch the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.560

island game I'm London out and we

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.700 
island game I'm London out and we

an<00:00:34.550> old<00:00:34.640> competition<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.569> think<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:36.850> suffered

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
an old competition I think it suffered

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.790 
an old competition I think it suffered
slighted<00:00:38.239> attends<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.199> last<00:00:39.350> week<00:00:39.559> from

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
slighted attends the last week from

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.579 
slighted attends the last week from
while<00:00:40.219> two<00:00:40.399> things<00:00:40.699> from<00:00:40.940> one<00:00:41.319> not<00:00:42.319> play

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
while two things from one not play

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.319 
while two things from one not play
themselves<00:00:42.800> before<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:43.670> sorted<00:00:43.999> out<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.149> week

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
themselves before we sorted out the week

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.259 
themselves before we sorted out the week
before<00:00:44.479> but<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.309> probably<00:00:46.309> not<00:00:46.489> been<00:00:46.850> able<00:00:46.969> to

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
before but to probably not been able to

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.840 
before but to probably not been able to
to<00:00:48.010> understand<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.100> opposition<00:00:49.579> as<00:00:49.670> much

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
to understand the opposition as much

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.000 
to understand the opposition as much
again<00:00:50.059> it's<00:00:50.210> difficult<00:00:50.569> when<00:00:50.749> you<00:00:50.870> were<00:00:51.109> a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
again it's difficult when you were a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.129 
again it's difficult when you were a
team<00:00:52.519> like<00:00:53.149> feeding<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.839> you've<00:00:53.989> got

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
team like feeding that you've got

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:55.360 
team like feeding that you've got
limited<00:00:54.499> knowledge<00:00:54.679> on<00:00:54.979> some<00:00:55.159> level

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
limited knowledge on some level

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.419 
limited knowledge on some level
individuals<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:57.350> really<00:00:57.889> really<00:00:58.100> ready<00:00:58.339> for

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
individuals to really really ready for

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.939 
individuals to really really ready for
that<00:00:58.609> gear<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.359> we<00:00:59.749> expect<00:01:00.079> town<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.589> be<00:01:00.709> very

expectation<00:01:26.780> on<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:26.960> team<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.650> know<00:01:27.740> there

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
expectation on the team you know there

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.940 
expectation on the team you know there
has<00:01:28.010> been<00:01:28.190> for<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.700> fair<00:01:29.150> period<00:01:29.480> of<00:01:29.540> tamanna

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
has been for a fair period of tamanna

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.620 
has been for a fair period of tamanna
none<00:01:30.950> more<00:01:31.160> so<00:01:31.340> than<00:01:31.370> upon<00:01:31.760> ourselves<00:01:31.880> there

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
none more so than upon ourselves there

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.460 
none more so than upon ourselves there
and<00:01:33.310> thought<00:01:34.310> we<00:01:34.460> were<00:01:34.610> nearer<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.510> what<00:01:35.690> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and thought we were nearer to what to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.050 
and thought we were nearer to what to
what<00:01:36.620> we<00:01:36.800> can<00:01:36.980> actually<00:01:37.100> produce<00:01:37.460> last<00:01:37.850> week

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
what we can actually produce last week

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.380 
what we can actually produce last week
not<00:01:38.330> quite<00:01:38.570> where<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:38.870> needed<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.170> be<00:01:40.390> which

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
not quite where we needed to be which

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.030 
not quite where we needed to be which
probably<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.870> about<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:42.530> who<00:01:42.620> were<00:01:42.770> playing

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
probably not about what who were playing

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.320 
probably not about what who were playing
against<00:01:43.400> our<00:01:43.490> minutes<00:01:43.700> about<00:01:43.940> how<00:01:44.060> were

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
against our minutes about how were

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.850 
against our minutes about how were
performing<00:01:44.540> ourselves<00:01:45.230> which<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.500> important

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
performing ourselves which is important

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.340 
performing ourselves which is important
for<00:01:45.980> us<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.370> think<00:01:46.700> like<00:01:46.820> Steve<00:01:47.150> said<00:01:47.180> are<00:01:47.960> going

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
for us I think like Steve said are going

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.570 
for us I think like Steve said are going
to<00:01:48.409> turn<00:01:48.560> up<00:01:48.590> tomorrow<00:01:48.980> throw<00:01:49.190> everything<00:01:49.370> out

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580
