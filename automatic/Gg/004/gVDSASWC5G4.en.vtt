00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.159
 What to do now 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 That's right Hi 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.030
 Of course at this time there are important things 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.950
 Distance still is launch plenty of taxation also Hageensuto 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.580
 Very difficult state is on the left side chestnut 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.670
 It is trouble to machine more than 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 When we see play in the form of an amateur golfer 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:36.810
 There are many who look only from the back 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.140
 It ends with the idea that there is no color devil somewhere 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:43.490
 This is the first thing about a tour pro 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.240
 Think above before aiming for 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:51.050
 Unfortunately there is no place where the air comes out, but in this condition the branch has already come out 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.760
 I will 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 further 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.700
 This side try and Oko's here is I do not know to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 We look at from the side 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:08.800
 I could see it a bit far from the side, for example, I just couldn't figure it out just by looking at it from behind 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.820
 One piece of information was done 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.180
 Look at the right side 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.350
 The ov ob piles are lined up nicely 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.730
 So right ob left is the Clie rally 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.500
 Furthermore from the Po event of that ball 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.850
 How many meters ahead if you hit the ball 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.700
 Do you have this branch 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.430
 Do not we have to firmly observe the this area 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.310
 It just means that it is not good to put out 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.950
 That ball is the first choice as an option 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.480
 It will have one thing not exposed to this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 Let's take a form to stand in the other direction 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.720
 I just feel like watching 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.250
 For example, by standing in between 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.960
 You've just standing flag is in the middle of the streamers fairway 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.100
 Present or around the year 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:15.340
 You can just 100 yards 150 yards and disgusting child 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.340
 Judgment including that there are many yards from the position of the ball to the green 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.840
 Must do 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.410
 in short 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.880
 It is immediately understood that it is quite severe that it is going to reach the green from this position 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.430
 I think 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:40.780
 The next thing to think about is to confirm the penalty on the right and left to confirm the eye 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:42.280
 Eyes answer that one may be put out to where finally Now what-iron after the confirmation in the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.840
 I can do it 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:55.500
 Now Mr. Yamaguchi Mr. that ball is not once from here 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 You need to hit a few yards to heal and capture the green from here 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.780
 x is do 100 yen 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.080
 It will be difficult this scene is so 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.530
 If it is called Mr. Yamaguchi 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.560
 It was thought how to put out if it was the judgment immediately after 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.560
 Hmm 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.430
 Yes What number hand 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.130
 So that you 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.050
 For example , how many books do you bring here 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:42.610
 Yes tee No. 6 and No. 8 Garden middle Ya 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:47.650
 I 'm going to lower the price I already removed this 10th choice 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.700
 So 's made it No. 8 or No. 6 to the fact that No. 8 or No. 6 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.540
 The distance to thinking 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.650
 One shot of the following 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.450
 Put out to or 8th reach the sixth hand 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.920
 How long do you need an answer 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.430
 For example, considering the power of the caller, the 6-iron is a full swing 9 and 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.430
 Fly 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.860
 110 yards 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.070
 That means it's already 80 yards with 6 iron if I give the answer 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.430
 let's do it 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.520
 When I put out 80 yards, I think the rest is about 110 yards . 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.150
 Then hit ceased No. 6 now 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.190
 You can use 60,000 yen again then 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.639
 It is that the idea say However well the next position is in the fairway 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.840
 That's a condition 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.939
 So I can not finish management just by saying how good to put it on the fairway 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.770
 It is 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:50.969
 It is one after having taken out, but how do you get on the green for yourself ? 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:55.240
 Given the far that wonder if asked and course management 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:59.920
 It is not this strike It is this strike + next 1 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.430
 You will get a very strong score when you get there 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.660
 Please give two tips 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.660
 Let's do it 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.460
 In Yes actually select the sixth salt Let's put out 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:20.830
 Yes, I have to confirm when I set it first 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.910
 Of course it is very dangerous to hit the previous taste, so a little shadow swing 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.409
 I wonder if you imagine 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.989
 Will you arrive 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:31.249
 It's a bit dangerous just in the middle of it, and I thought it was going to put the ball up and to the right 

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:34.670
 A little left 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:39.790
 It seems like you 're open back 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:43.129
 Yes I have now important thing is not supposed to absolutely put because it is management's 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.820
 A swing drive dive again without shaking 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:50.710
 It is good without shaking 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:55.620
 How is the follow-through field ideal for that branch but is it all right 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.620
 Maybe it is not a day when the moon is fine 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.770
 Then the ghost is actually set 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:08.620
 A little left foot closer to the ball 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:13.330
 Let's aim at high school all right or that mother or ç§¦ left 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:18.120
 The final is a confirmation is lightly shaken again Prabhu 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:21.479
 Is it all right? In the process that it has swung over more than that 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.900
 Please It is dangerous to swing up dare it is more 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:31.639
 That's right under I stand on this side 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.639
 It means that the ball came to the left foot side 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:44.520
 The center of gravity is behind the left foot. Confirm again that it is not 100% of each person in this. 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:47.129
 iz It is very dangerous if you do not play with a sense of security that it is okay. 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.179
 There is a case that does not end with injury 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.179
 Well then 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.599
 Fix your knees 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.470
 It would be better to aim from the right side of the day for a little more 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:14.340
 The escape was successful, but slightly left to the left to his original goal 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:20.610
 Well, I need some experience but the ball position 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:23.310
 One correct answer you, but the next shot that was able to this branch very escape was a difficult situation 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.540
 It will be a shot from rough 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.800
 So you have to think again 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.800
 Yes please do your best
