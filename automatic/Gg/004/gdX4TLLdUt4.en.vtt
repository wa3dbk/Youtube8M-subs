00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.290
 to ask him to go for little 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.670
 he did not have songs so they will arrive 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.640
 esain troya welcome all this time 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.539
 we are with another video tutorial this time 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.199
 it's like making foot of finite 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.810
 it is very easy with little or little a little 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.220
 resource 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.100
 what is the first thing we have to do 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.880
 look for a place where 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.040
 we are going to give it a little volume 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.079
 any flat place we're going to 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 put it a moment in creative of everything 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.300
 It is very easy to do with little recourse 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.890
 and well come on let's go to the system 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 you put the stone 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.250
 then for here 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.309
 3 for her 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.309
 and do this 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.080
 and now what are we going to do with permission 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.610
 moment 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 one moment 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.500
 since I 'm going to eat ok we're going to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 do 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.620
 we have to get us for this mode 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 survival 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.950
 we have to get a bucket of water and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.100
 a true lava bucket this is for 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.340
 make infinite stone truth we have to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.340
 open 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.900
 open a hole a hole down or 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 be down so that the water does not 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.220
 overflow and we put it like that until here with 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 the bucket we do the same 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.740
 and even here with our stone peak 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.740
 same 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.390
 we all put ourselves in it 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.080
 in the game on 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 we put to zero 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.200
 - Well let's apply here 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.390
 it is created again they have to do what 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.210
 minimum with four hearts what yes it 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.840
 they are burning they throw themselves into the water once 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.840
 good 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.440
 It's very good because it gives you time to 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.440
 grab the stone and go back up 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.500
 um 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.580
 it's an extremely easy process you throw away 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.360
 you grab your 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.090
 you throw you grab in turn you have it 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.790
 you grab your turn and so on 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.620
 and now 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.079
 how you create the option is from the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.840
 next way we can we have to 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.920
 have for example that you want this 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.390
 5 obsidian 5 scene habits 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.390
 we do the following there 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.170
 just a moment 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.290
 okay 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.719
 how many you want to be 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.180
 from or citizen to make a portal 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:35.359
 when measuring or something like that we do the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.359
 following we put on sometimes 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.370
 for survival a charles haldeman 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.130
 pikes and you put a big powder of 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.220
 oxidant 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.380
 of redstone and immediately it's going to 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.140
 create your obsidian block by 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.810
 consequently you have to have your peak of 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.320
 diamonds in which I have been 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.460
 forgotten to put it in inventory one 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.470
 once you put your diamond peak 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.500
 survival and all this this already 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.500
 I do because good 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
 survival 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.900
 because he is explaining this well 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.060
 always looking at the lava 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.660
 you have to bite always looking towards the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.900
 wash this the bites as there is no no 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.190
 a lot of risk and how fast is the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.639
 water tdt of the winter of spades and you put 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.639
 already 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:50.080
 ok the procedure is easy 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.840
 apply put another of this and so 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.840
 successively until you have some 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.620
 obsidian block that you want 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.419
 this 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.100
 well let's apply it again for 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.100
 that they see and already and this would be the last 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.790
 and spades 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.030
 that shit be slow to sting 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.150
 cowboys and shit 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.919
 good for more an explanation 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.490
 quickly how much block there is to 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.590
 here and there 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.620
 here the medium ay 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:34.900
 123 three blocks against the middle 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.900
 would be in total 12 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.479
 seven blocks 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:51.050
 yes seven blocks 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.240
 one here and one there and another seven more 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.250
 now what 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.699
 it's super simple to make us 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:04.249
 taken a lot a lot process is 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:06.289
 very easy to do and very practical 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.709
 that these actions have no stone 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.249
 stone in case this happens to you watts 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:17.930
 you throw for the water 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:20.270
 and well you know normal if it stings stone 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.900
 typical 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.400
 and add remaining obsidian good 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.420
 this is true I hope you have 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.350
