00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
going to undo undo this ball yes now

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.040 
going to undo undo this ball yes now
there<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.050> two<00:00:34.230> ways<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.739> making<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.550> ball

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
there are two ways of making the ball

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
there are two ways of making the ball
one<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.250> white<00:00:39.000> part<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.370> covering<00:00:41.370> most

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
one is the white part is covering most

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.360 
one is the white part is covering most
of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> ball<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.739> red<00:00:43.920> part<00:00:43.950> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of the ball and one is the red part is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.150 
of the ball and one is the red part is
covering<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.420> most<00:00:45.629> most<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> ball<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
covering the most most of the ball so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650 
covering the most most of the ball so
I'm<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> show<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.700> both<00:00:48.000> ways<00:00:48.059> but

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I'm going to show you both ways but

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.150 
I'm going to show you both ways but
first<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.320> start<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> red<00:00:49.860> part

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
first I want to start with the red part

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.250 
first I want to start with the red part
so<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:50.820> you're<00:00:50.940> doing<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> red<00:00:51.390> part<00:00:51.690> you're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so if you're doing the red part you're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
so if you're doing the red part you're
going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> red<00:00:53.070> triangle<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
going to see a red triangle here and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
going to see a red triangle here and
it's<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.899> facing<00:00:55.110> upwards<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it's going to be facing upwards like a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
it's going to be facing upwards like a
ramp<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.920> first<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> turn<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
ramp so first you're going to turn it

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.319 
ramp so first you're going to turn it
away<00:00:59.760> from<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:02.090> then<00:01:03.090> you're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
away from you like that then you're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
away from you like that then you're
going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> count<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.619> two<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.250> turn<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
going to count to one two and turn it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
going to count to one two and turn it
towards<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:07.159> then<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> count<00:01:08.640> 1<00:01:09.000> 1<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.990> then

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
towards you then you count 1 1 and then

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.160 
towards you then you count 1 1 and then
turn<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.520> away<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.040> then<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turn it away from you then you what it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.020 
turn it away from you then you what it
can't<00:01:16.500> -<00:01:16.950> again<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> turn<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> away<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
can't - again and turn it away from you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.170 
can't - again and turn it away from you
then<00:01:21.030> these<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> meet<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.909> have

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
then these two have to meet so you have

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.200 
then these two have to meet so you have
to<00:01:24.390> turn<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.650> joint<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.000> turn

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to turn this this joint here has to turn

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
to turn this this joint here has to turn
like<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.610> joy<00:01:29.880> too<00:01:30.210> has<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like this and then this joy too has to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.899 
like this and then this joy too has to
turn<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.909> turn

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
turn like that so now you want to turn

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.609 
turn like that so now you want to turn
this<00:01:36.270> joint<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.159> do<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:39.229> after<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this joint and do this after that you

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
this joint and do this after that you
want<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.670> this

and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:10.229> here's<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> bit<00:02:11.129> tricky<00:02:11.459> part<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.330> do

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and then here's a bit tricky part you do

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.710 
and then here's a bit tricky part you do
this<00:02:12.690> okay<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.379> this<00:02:19.069> this

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.449 
this okay then you have to do this this
and<00:02:21.720> do<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:24.440> then<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> turn<00:02:26.010> this

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
and do that then you want to turn this

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.390 
and do that then you want to turn this
but<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:27.239> doesn't<00:02:27.510> quite<00:02:27.930> fit<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
but it really doesn't quite fit so you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670 
but it really doesn't quite fit so you
have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> turn<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.420> again<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.200> fits

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
have to turn this again and fits

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.070 
have to turn this again and fits
perfectly<00:02:32.450> then<00:02:33.450> you're<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.840> hold<00:02:33.959> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
