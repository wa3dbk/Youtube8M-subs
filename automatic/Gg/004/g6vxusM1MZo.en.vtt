00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.630 
hopefully releasing a texture pack on
minecraft<00:01:18.329> ps3<00:01:18.509> before<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.890> release<00:01:20.219> of<00:01:20.399> tu

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
minecraft ps3 before the release of tu

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.209 
minecraft ps3 before the release of tu
14<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.570> statement<00:01:22.079> that<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.380> being<00:01:22.649> tested

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
14 the statement that it's being tested

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.160 
14 the statement that it's being tested
says<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.939> me<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.360> already<00:01:24.689> complete

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
says to me that it's already complete

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
says to me that it's already complete
and<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.649> know<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> preliminary

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and not you know in the preliminary

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
and not you know in the preliminary
stages<00:01:26.789> so<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.899> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.109> be

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
stages so I think we're going to be

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.399 
stages so I think we're going to be
seeing<00:01:28.469> it<00:01:28.649> probably<00:01:29.070> well<00:01:29.280> before<00:01:29.729> tu<00:01:30.479> 14<00:01:30.899> so

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
seeing it probably well before tu 14 so

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
seeing it probably well before tu 14 so
those<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.740> us<00:01:31.859> on<00:01:32.009> minecraft<00:01:32.460> ps3<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:33.030> be
