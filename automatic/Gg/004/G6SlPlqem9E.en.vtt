00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
just for fun I made a silicone mold from

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.130 
just for fun I made a silicone mold from
actual<00:02:47.730> Lego<00:02:48.060> bricks<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> two-part

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
actual Lego bricks and a two-part

silicone mix from a special-effects
supply<00:02:51.060> store<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.200> should<00:02:52.410> know<00:02:52.590> that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
supply store now you should know that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.350 
supply store now you should know that
when<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> syrup<00:02:53.310> cools<00:02:53.610> down<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.270> to

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
when the syrup cools down it's going to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.880 
when the syrup cools down it's going to
shrink<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.660> little<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> compensate<00:02:55.470> for

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
shrink a little so to compensate for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.440 
shrink a little so to compensate for
that<00:02:56.040> try<00:02:56.310> filling<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.700> molds<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.240> tiny

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
that try filling the molds just a tiny

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.390 
that try filling the molds just a tiny
bit<00:02:57.660> higher<00:02:57.870> than<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> top<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:59.250> one

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
bit higher than the top for one

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.070 
bit higher than the top for one
finishing<00:02:59.820> touch<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.180> got<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> clean<00:03:00.600> Lego<00:03:00.840> base

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
finishing touch I got a clean Lego base

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.360 
finishing touch I got a clean Lego base
plate<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.440> brushed<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.950> lightly<00:03:02.160> with

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
plate and brushed it lightly with

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.980 
plate and brushed it lightly with
vegetable<00:03:02.580> oil<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.270> carefully<00:03:03.750> place<00:03:03.960> it

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
vegetable oil then carefully place it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.170 
vegetable oil then carefully place it
down<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.320> top<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.830> mold<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.880> see<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
down on top of the mold you can see the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.820 
down on top of the mold you can see the
edges<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.630> little<00:03:06.900> dimples<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.470> help<00:03:07.620> keep

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
edges have little dimples to help keep

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.740 
edges have little dimples to help keep
all<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.100> studs<00:03:08.370> perfectly<00:03:08.880> aligned<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.570> all

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
all the studs perfectly aligned so all

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.030 
all the studs perfectly aligned so all
it<00:03:09.900> needs<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.410> something<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.860> heavy

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it needs now is something like a heavy

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.620 
it needs now is something like a heavy
book<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.520> give<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.790> some<00:03:11.910> weight<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.270> hold<00:03:12.510> it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
book to give it some weight and hold it

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.960 
book to give it some weight and hold it
in<00:03:12.720> place<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.260> let<00:03:14.160> these<00:03:14.280> ones<00:03:14.490> cool<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
in place I let these ones cool on the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.610 
in place I let these ones cool on the
counter<00:03:15.120> for<00:03:15.420> around<00:03:15.600> 6<00:03:15.900> hours<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> can

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
counter for around 6 hours and you can

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.990 
counter for around 6 hours and you can
see<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:16.890> if<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.040> carefully<00:03:17.310> remove<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.730> base

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
see that if we carefully remove the base

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.850 
see that if we carefully remove the base
plate<00:03:18.300> now<00:03:18.480> our<00:03:18.780> little<00:03:19.020> Lego<00:03:19.260> gummies<00:03:19.470> have

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
plate now our little Lego gummies have

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
plate now our little Lego gummies have
small<00:03:20.160> divots<00:03:20.550> on<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.790> bottom<00:03:21.090> which<00:03:21.360> means

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
small divots on the bottom which means

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.960 
small divots on the bottom which means
they're<00:03:22.020> connectible<00:03:22.650> let's<00:03:23.550> take<00:03:23.730> one<00:03:23.880> of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
they're connectible let's take one of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.040 
they're connectible let's take one of
the<00:03:24.030> bricks<00:03:24.180> out<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> mold<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.870> take<00:03:25.020> a

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
the bricks out of the mold and take a

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.170 
the bricks out of the mold and take a
good<00:03:25.260> look<00:03:25.320> up<00:03:25.620> close<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:26.790> see<00:03:26.970> there's<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
good look up close you can see there's a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970 
good look up close you can see there's a
surprising<00:03:27.810> amount<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.080> detail<00:03:28.410> captured<00:03:28.890> in

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
surprising amount of detail captured in

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.590 
surprising amount of detail captured in
the<00:03:29.040> gummy<00:03:29.220> snack<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.880> they're<00:03:30.030> not<00:03:30.180> sticky

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
the gummy snack and they're not sticky

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600 
the gummy snack and they're not sticky
at<00:03:30.690> all<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:31.260> actually<00:03:31.380> quite<00:03:31.830> firm<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.190> they

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
at all but actually quite firm and they

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.000 
at all but actually quite firm and they
smell<00:03:32.940> delicious<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:34.140> probably<00:03:34.440> also<00:03:34.620> notice

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
smell delicious you probably also notice

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.560 
smell delicious you probably also notice
they're<00:03:35.160> completely<00:03:35.550> transparent<00:03:36.360> which

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
they're completely transparent which

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.970 
they're completely transparent which
puts<00:03:36.810> their<00:03:36.930> level<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.290> Awesomeness<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.950> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
puts their level of Awesomeness on a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.280 
puts their level of Awesomeness on a
completely<00:03:38.430> different<00:03:38.550> scale<00:03:39.110> alright<00:03:40.110> let's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
completely different scale alright let's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.780 
completely different scale alright let's
take<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.560> idea<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.010> next<00:03:41.310> level<00:03:41.640> with

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
take this idea to the next level with

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.900 
take this idea to the next level with
different<00:03:42.180> colors<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.510> different<00:03:43.110> flavors<00:03:43.230> I

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
different colors and different flavors I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.130 
different colors and different flavors I
tripled<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:44.970> recipes<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.630> made<00:03:45.750> seven

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
tripled the recipes and made seven

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.660 
tripled the recipes and made seven
different<00:03:46.440> batches<00:03:46.620> then<00:03:47.220> let<00:03:47.370> them<00:03:47.489> cool

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
different batches then let them cool

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.220 
different batches then let them cool
overnight<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.270> they'd<00:03:48.360> all<00:03:48.480> be<00:03:48.630> crystal<00:03:48.989> clear

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
overnight so they'd all be crystal clear

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.020 
overnight so they'd all be crystal clear
now<00:03:49.860> if<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.040> try<00:03:50.190> doing<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.520> yourself<00:03:50.940> you

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
now if you try doing this yourself you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.130 
now if you try doing this yourself you
might<00:03:51.239> find<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.570> getting<00:03:51.720> them<00:03:51.959> out<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.050> the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
might find that getting them out of the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.290 
might find that getting them out of the
cups<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.590> pretty<00:03:52.860> tricky<00:03:53.100> when<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.940> do<00:03:54.150> get

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
cups is pretty tricky when you do get

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.640 
cups is pretty tricky when you do get
them<00:03:54.450> out<00:03:54.570> though<00:03:54.780> you'll<00:03:55.020> have<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.170> gob<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
them out though you'll have a gob of

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.410 
them out though you'll have a gob of
gummy<00:03:55.890> that's<00:03:56.250> way<00:03:56.459> too<00:03:56.489> big<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:56.940> eat<00:03:57.150> on<00:03:57.300> its

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
gummy that's way too big to eat on its

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.150 
gummy that's way too big to eat on its
own<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:58.080> that's<00:03:58.170> okay<00:03:58.560> because<00:03:58.590> what<00:03:59.040> we're

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
own but that's okay because what we're

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.800 
own but that's okay because what we're
really<00:03:59.310> after<00:03:59.520> here<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.209> white<00:04:00.420> layer<00:04:00.630> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
really after here is the white layer of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.690 
really after here is the white layer of
gummy<00:04:00.989> foam<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> top<00:04:01.709> now<00:04:02.430> if<00:04:02.550> you're

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
gummy foam at the top now if you're

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.890 
gummy foam at the top now if you're
really<00:04:02.790> careful<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.300> can<00:04:03.570> use<00:04:03.690> something

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
really careful you can use something

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.880 
really careful you can use something
like<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.140> kitchen<00:04:04.350> knife

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
like a kitchen knife
