 It's like this frosty thing. 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:13.400
 As a catapult that nature blessed souls For two groups now, so reducing wake up in the morning 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.400
 This state is spirited 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.759
 3 cases each 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.759
 That is to say, 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.110
 Oh, and also his film work load Yes 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.830
 It's cramped and then 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:38.410
 This means that the same site a few words, the parser magnetic one little space now 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.479
 New jjugeuryeo do not you do not you do jingeo 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:49.479
 I have to live my sensibility with my legs. Yes. 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:54.670
 Where did this to 5 on the face to me and take the first losses of the accredited 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.460
 The power of others, such as the rights of others , should not be viewed as evil and harmful 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.580
 That's why we're here. 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.550
 Yes, even if you have a minimum of justice 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.409
 The Podamoka basics or yes 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.390
 If you agree on terms 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.890
 It is the great point to say that the relationship between labor and management is just the standard point in the Korean society . 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.950
 It's an agreement between labor and management . 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.500
 And then, 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.690
 Mochi is a window I heard 3 through Hyundai Motor'll not only be yiyanggu plight 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.010
 We're done. 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.739
 So this social reference point is what we want to keep 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.970
 Yes So this 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.200
 Even in such love, the leadership continues to explain that it must be kept 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 I can not tell . 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.180
 And now, just stay silent on that column. 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.959
 I do not know why I want to save 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:54.010
 It seems to be watching the impressive drama of choice to protect 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.330
 I think that's the law now. 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.930
 If this applies to what is inconceivable doegeodeunyo But the precious moon just workers 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:08.230
 If you do not see the shard gray state, 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.239
 Or this guy went through the elementary school of Korean Air For people who life 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.000
 Gamer behind 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:18.040
 Uh, which people are employed in accordance with the law, regardless of the company. But why continue 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.099
 If you are trying to recruit 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.720
 So each time you choose these people 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:28.810
 But now I'm a big guy, 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.700
 I am one of my delegates and I love Korea. 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.440
 Yes, I am a younger brother who decided to cooperate with my family for 10 years . 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.800
 It can not be fixed. 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.350
 Oh, do I lead our school but who would much 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:49.210
 After secretary secretary, there will be in-house subcontract workers from before 1998 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:54.840
 And listen before dwaetgo laid in 1998 Nicholas Tse and come back to live 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:59.800
 In 1950, a person working without a product worked in an administration that worked 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.640
 Subscribe to this guy came out the door you tearing him choeyongsin 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.170
 I have also given you a letter of recommendation for my love of Taehee Jemi . 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.540
 I'm talking about are called 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:14.950
 Over 18 years of coloring in-house subcontract workers and I do not know him . 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.840
 That so many people are self-strung safely many people actually 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:23.040
 The legal 5 is too high to be used 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.419
 When I decided to lead a great privilege to ask him to talk of the company 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.530
 Fill 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.210
 In the case of the broom etc, you have to take the box in the case of the queen 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.400
 I'm on. 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.400
 This crew is the one in figure 6. 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:42.680
 Oh, but that 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:48.609
 That's the kind of thing that could make a genius of the current car 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:53.439
 Now I have been making workers but they're caused health reasons 

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:58.509
 Geulgu including his gun a little long did this all deoni bachyeoseo 9 workers 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:05:02.859
 8 hageodeunyo two euros excluding almost got wise but why these people should be excluded 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:06.249
 According to the original law, these people were converted into full-time jobs, 

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:10.989
 Some people may be converted and hired . 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:14.229
 By law, of course , people who are to be converted into full-time jobs, 

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:19.359
 Why do you want to experience while exclusion ? 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:23.829
 We'm itneungeo and keep talking that we should therefore switch 

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:25.029
 This is the first problem I have so let 's call me to come to me 

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:30.039
 I'm talking. 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:33.369
 Jung Ah uh uh, I do not mind, I part 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:36.669
 You can not get to school, you just have to work. 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:42.159
 Just get it together . It 's okay . 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:44.199
 However, I cracked him I learned the modern attempts to breathe Brewing Co. 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.669
 Why are you excluded 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:51.119
 Almost you have to work together with another kind of battles to fight so far 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.119
 there is 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:01.580
 I should never be such people before anyone is excluded 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.659
 This thing that I think is of course people should be excluded because this is why holding 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.330
 This can not happen. 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:11.919
 But this is the first one. 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:17.169
 Kane laws than those that were not the company side 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.979
 Trying to trick the problem into something in a downward way 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.370
 I'm doing it. 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:27.330
 Fortunately, one and the second, 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.730
 If we admit it, it is the moment when we let go and live illegally. 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.980
 What you are trying to deceive 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:38.250
 It is not necessary to see the consensus in our country. 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.630
 I'll tell you to follow the law. 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:47.280
 Even if I die, I can not even do it again . 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:51.420
 Now, as public opinion is pushed, it's strangely as if a person is doing something very evacuate 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:55.410
 After I wrapped it in , I forced it to be portrayed 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.130
 At the moment of this agreement, it is not necessary 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.600
 It is. 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:04.340
 If you stick to number three, you're above law, unconditionally. 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.340
 So I can not tolerate this.
