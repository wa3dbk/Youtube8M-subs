00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
against a death threat now we couldn't

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.160 
against a death threat now we couldn't
see<00:01:36.340> anywhere<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.700> it<00:01:37.000> still<00:01:37.689> has<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.960> hit<00:01:38.079> on

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
see anywhere that it still has to hit on

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.779 
see anywhere that it still has to hit on
sixes<00:01:38.649> so<00:01:38.799> we<00:01:38.859> assume<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.189> it<00:01:39.369> was<00:01:39.460> weapon

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
sixes so we assume that it was weapon

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.449 
sixes so we assume that it was weapon
skill<00:01:40.060> but<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:41.229> didn't<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.860> anything<00:01:42.069> anyway

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
skill but it didn't do anything anyway

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.669 
skill but it didn't do anything anyway
so<00:01:42.819> the<00:01:43.360> fire<00:01:43.569> warriors<00:01:43.840> pile<00:01:44.079> in<00:01:44.289> now<00:01:44.409> they<00:01:44.590> do

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
so the fire warriors pile in now they do

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.660 
so the fire warriors pile in now they do
get<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.890> go<00:01:45.009> first<00:01:45.250> because<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:46.060> works<00:01:46.810> are

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
get to go first because the works are

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.800 
get to go first because the works are

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
attacked through difficult terrain and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.419 
attacked through difficult terrain and
the<00:01:49.869> challenges<00:01:50.350> issued<00:01:50.740> between<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.219> fire

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
the challenges issued between the fire

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.160 
the challenges issued between the fire
warrior<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.909> orc<00:01:52.090> he<00:01:52.810> hits<00:01:52.959> with<00:01:53.079> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
first move and fails to wound and then

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.149 
first move and fails to wound and then
pinky<00:01:56.049> attacks<00:01:56.349> back<00:01:56.590> now<00:01:56.829> he<00:01:56.890> should<00:01:57.069> have

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
pinky attacks back now he should have

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.589 
pinky attacks back now he should have
only<00:01:57.280> had<00:01:57.489> three<00:01:57.670> attacks<00:01:57.970> because<00:01:58.239> I<00:01:58.329> forgot

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
only had three attacks because I forgot

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.569 
only had three attacks because I forgot
that<00:01:58.840> they<00:01:58.929> have<00:01:59.110> photon<00:01:59.560> grenades<00:01:59.950> which

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
that they have photon grenades which

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.919 
that they have photon grenades which
would<00:02:00.789> have<00:02:00.849> been<00:02:00.909> minus<00:02:01.270> one<00:02:01.479> but<00:02:01.780> rather

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
would have been minus one but rather

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.289 
would have been minus one but rather
they<00:02:02.140> don't<00:02:02.319> get<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.560> attack<00:02:02.770> on<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.979> charge

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
they don't get the attack on a charge

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.699 
they don't get the attack on a charge
but<00:02:04.299> anyway<00:02:04.840> he<00:02:04.959> failed<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.319> do<00:02:05.409> any<00:02:05.530> wounds

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
within the orcs attack which it should

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.759 
within the orcs attack which it should
have<00:02:10.509> been<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.660> lot<00:02:10.840> less<00:02:10.959> attacks<00:02:11.319> as<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.590> but

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
have been a lot less attacks as your but

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.190 
have been a lot less attacks as your but
that's<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.519> way<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.670> happens<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:14.019> course

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
that's the way it happens and of course

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.600 
that's the way it happens and of course
all<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.440> other<00:02:14.560> fire<00:02:14.739> warriors<00:02:15.129> except<00:02:15.430> for

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
sits there he fails his leadership

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.180 
sits there he fails his leadership
because<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.900> ethereal<00:02:20.410> he<00:02:20.530> gets<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.829> reroll

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190

it<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.549> he<00:02:21.700> does<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.209> past<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.660> second<00:02:23.019> one

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
it and he does for past the second one

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.440 
it and he does for past the second one
on<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.379> three
