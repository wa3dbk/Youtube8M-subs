00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
that makes it stand out from the rest

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.500 
that makes it stand out from the rest
and<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.920> has<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.460> that<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.240> actually

and it has to be that you can actually

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.800 
and it has to be that you can actually
have<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.770> design<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.580> front<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.600> as

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
have a back design on the front but as

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.690 
have a back design on the front but as
it's<00:03:01.380> just<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.620> mirrored<00:03:01.920> back<00:03:02.100> what's<00:03:02.430> really

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
it's just a mirrored back what's really

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.970 
it's just a mirrored back what's really
cool<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.600> fan<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.230> way<00:03:04.470> like

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
cool this is if you fan it one way like

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.220 
cool this is if you fan it one way like
a<00:03:05.010> normal<00:03:05.430> fan<00:03:05.670> you'll<00:03:06.209> get<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.570> color<00:03:06.900> fan

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
a normal fan you'll get this color fan

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.160 
a normal fan you'll get this color fan
but<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:08.010> if<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.310> get<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:09.510> fan<00:03:09.900> here

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
but then if you get to a this fan here

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.900 
but then if you get to a this fan here
if<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> reverse<00:03:11.040> found<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
if you do a reverse found you get a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.760 
if you do a reverse found you get a
different<00:03:12.390> color<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.020> that's<00:03:13.320> what<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> like

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
different color and that's what I like

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.800 
different color and that's what I like
because<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.489> do<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.760> way<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.420> get<00:03:15.570> one

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
because if you do this way you get one

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.870 
because if you do this way you get one
color<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.680> only<00:03:16.830> if<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> reverse<00:03:17.610> fan

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
color but only if you do a reverse fan

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
color but only if you do a reverse fan
you<00:03:18.239> get<00:03:18.390> another<00:03:18.660> color<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.410> what's<00:03:19.620> cool<00:03:19.860> of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
you get another color and what's cool of

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.220 
you get another color and what's cool of
this<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.430> even<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.970> shuffle<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.480> up<00:03:21.600> it

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
this is even if you shuffle it up it

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.199 
this is even if you shuffle it up it
doesn't<00:03:22.590> affect<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.250> at<00:03:23.459> all<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.060> will

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
doesn't affect it at all and it will

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.840 
doesn't affect it at all and it will
still<00:03:24.510> fan<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.440> still<00:03:25.830> I'm<00:03:26.040> mirrored<00:03:26.370> back<00:03:26.580> and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
still fan so still I'm mirrored back and

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.610 
still fan so still I'm mirrored back and
that's<00:03:27.120> what<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.330> like<00:03:27.570> about<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.930> deck<00:03:28.170> that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

that's what I like about this deck that
is<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.070> unique<00:03:29.550> now<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.510> face<00:03:30.780> even<00:03:31.140> has<00:03:31.290> this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
is so unique now the face even has this

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.740 
is so unique now the face even has this
too<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.950> could<00:03:32.160> he<00:03:32.220> show<00:03:32.430> an<00:03:32.550> example<00:03:32.750> so

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
too and I could he show an example so

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.259 
too and I could he show an example so

want the chip you can put that aside and
you<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.660> want<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:42.989> blank<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.920> can

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you just want it to be blank you can

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
you just want it to be blank you can
have<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.400> too<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.450> you've<00:03:45.570> got<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.750> do

is<00:03:45.930> remove<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.380> card<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.040> then<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:47.880> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
is remove this card and then just do a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.270 
is remove this card and then just do a
reverse<00:03:48.630> fan<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.230> then<00:03:49.350> there<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.799> your<00:03:49.920> pips

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280
