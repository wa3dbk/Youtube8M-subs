00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.390
 dispersion experiment 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.670
 light waves four times 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.109
 equipment 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.419
 a source 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:10.989
 white light 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.169
 more than 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.169
 a capacitor 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.089
 replaced by 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.749
 ederson 40 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 we went one step further 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.910
 we put the president 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.370
 like this one with its dark side facing us 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.980
 and it's past 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.900
 on the coast 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.010
 yet won by transparent behave as the light is 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 observed the phenomenon of dispersion 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 so we moved the Parisian on the road 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 we will formalize on the screen 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 the presence continues 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.920
 explanation of the dispersion phenomenon 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.469
 the spectrum of white light is made up of digital publications 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.300
 in the air they all have the same direction 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.100
 when she arrives on the prism 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.180
 they may be scattered 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
 each of these two different distribution meetings 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 then this is the group closed the site again to hit 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.170
 it's on the set 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.150
 to form de facto 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.700
 and now a great sporting moment I think it's time to let the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.390
 place in the physical championship 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.210
 all categories 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.939
 of course 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.439
 without sport 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.749
 how 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.089
 explanations 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.309
 of the phenomenon 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.299
 of dispersion 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.239
 all the light rays composing the white light comes with all the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.609
 same set of incidence on the prism 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.349
 all this the value of property 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.180
 because also all the same value of a refractive index and not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.620
 more than the speed of light 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.460
 in the air 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.610
 of all these rules emphasizes the site is equal to the speed of light 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.960
 obviously in a vacuum so putting it into action again m 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.879
 they all have the same product and my stretcher faith 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:45.969
 On the other hand 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.329
 as they are all lives with a different refaction name it wants 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.589
 say that 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.919
 from blue the different countries of the EU to the different countries of the EU red 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:58.219
 this product is in constant imply necessarily that the refractive index 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.629
 m2 of blue in the prism 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.629
 m of various the prism of red suspicions 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.149
 all different 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:08.309
 so what does it mean 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.489
 if the refractive indices of blue and different refractive indices of the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.699
 red it necessarily implies that the bus speed in the prism 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.989
 or celerity rather blue in the prism different from infertility 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.429
 red in the prism 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.729
 in other words, light chakou being defined as rather by its frequency 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:29.669
 it means that the severity of radiation depends on the frequency and 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.529
 well this phenomenon is called dispersion 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:37.370
 and so we can say without flinching without trembling that the prism and among the 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.659
 disperse for light waves
