00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Boston now in this video we're going to

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.360 
Boston now in this video we're going to
be<00:00:08.610> creating<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.530> web<00:00:10.530> application<00:00:10.710> if<00:00:11.280> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
be creating a web application if you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.210 
be creating a web application if you
like<00:00:11.610> or<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.360> script<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:14.509> works<00:00:15.560> in<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.890> similar

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
like or a script that works in a similar

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.870 
like or a script that works in a similar
way<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:18.350> now<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.680> text<00:00:20.100> box<00:00:20.310> here

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
way to this now we have a text box here

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.990 
way to this now we have a text box here
in<00:00:21.539> which<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.050> type<00:00:22.260> any<00:00:22.529> data<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> I'm

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
in which we can type any data so I'm

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.939 
in which we can type any data so I'm
going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> say<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.750> cat<00:00:25.050> sat<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.920> mat<00:00:26.779> in

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
going to say the cat sat on the mat in

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
going to say the cat sat on the mat in
this<00:00:28.949> box<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.670> search<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.359> string

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
this box here I can search for a string

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.500 
this box here I can search for a string
that<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.410> replace<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.550> particular<00:00:32.969> and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that I want to replace in particular and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.799 
that I want to replace in particular and
then<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> specify<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
then I want to specify what are to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
then I want to specify what are to
replace<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> let's<00:00:38.850> say<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> wanted<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
replace it with so let's say I wanted to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
replace it with so let's say I wanted to
search<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.989> Cat<00:00:41.090> Cat<00:00:42.090> exists<00:00:42.780> here<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
search for Cat Cat exists here in the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.150 
search for Cat Cat exists here in the
string<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> replace<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.950> with

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
string so I want to replace it with

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.209 
string so I want to replace it with
let's<00:00:47.430> say<00:00:47.700> dog<00:00:50.539> or<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:52.110> monkey<00:00:52.710> yeah

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
let's say dog or let's say monkey yeah

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.900 
let's say dog or let's say monkey yeah
speak<00:00:53.940> things<00:00:54.149> fun<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.550> I'm<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
speak things fun so now I'm going to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.990 
speak things fun so now I'm going to
click<00:00:57.059> find<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.480> replace<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.199> you'll<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
click find a replace and you'll see that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.260 
click find a replace and you'll see that
cat<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.859> replaced<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.309> string<00:01:02.730> monkey

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.440 

okay

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
okay

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.500 
okay
so<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.740> already<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.369> PHP<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.240> can

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so we already know in PHP that we can

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.010 
so we already know in PHP that we can
use<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.960> AB<00:01:10.640> STR<00:01:11.640> underscore<00:01:12.450> replace

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
use the AB STR underscore replace

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.210 
use the AB STR underscore replace
function<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.810> this<00:01:15.810> allows<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.770> specify

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
function and this allows you to specify

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240 
function and this allows you to specify
either<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.390> array<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.140> single<00:01:19.530> string<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
either an array or a single string to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.840 
either an array or a single string to
replace<00:01:21.110> now<00:01:22.110> let's<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.830> open<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.580> text

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
replace now let's just open up my text

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.160 
replace now let's just open up my text
editor<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.540> I'll<00:01:24.659> demonstrate<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
editor and I'll demonstrate this for you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.359 
editor and I'll demonstrate this for you
ok<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.340> STR<00:01:29.340> replace<00:01:30.140> works<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.530> taking<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
ok so STR replace works by taking the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.120 
ok so STR replace works by taking the
string<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.240> replace<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.590> data<00:01:34.829> in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
string you want to replace the data in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.120 
string you want to replace the data in
so<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> overall<00:01:36.119> string<00:01:36.590> which<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.890> case

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
so the overall string which in this case

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
so the overall string which in this case
would<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.060> text<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.810> box<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:41.150> then

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
would be the text in this box here then

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.410 
would be the text in this box here then
what<00:01:42.329> we'll<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.380> would<00:01:43.530> search<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
what we'll do is we would search for the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.190 
what we'll do is we would search for the
string<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.220> search<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:48.200> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
string that we want to search for so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.980 
string that we want to search for so
search<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.149> in<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.329> case<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.899> would

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
search and in this case it would

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.730 
search and in this case it would
correspond<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:54.470> then<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.619> we

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
correspond to this here then what we

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
correspond to this here then what we
would<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.399> specify<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:57.360> we

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
would do is we would specify what we

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.679 
would do is we would specify what we
want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> replace<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.600> that<00:02:00.600> would

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
want to replace it with and that would

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.560 
want to replace it with and that would
correspond<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.500> box<00:02:01.799> here

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
correspond to this box here

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.780 
correspond to this box here
however<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.990> tutorial<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> dealing<00:02:05.610> with

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
however this tutorial is dealing with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.740 
however this tutorial is dealing with
the<00:02:06.380> substring

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
the substring

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.840 
the substring
a<00:02:09.670> function<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.620> function<00:02:12.680> works<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.700> a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
a function and this function works in a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.300 
a function and this function works in a
similar<00:02:14.150> way<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:15.110> has<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> combination<00:02:15.710> of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
similar way that has a combination of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.110 
similar way that has a combination of
technique<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.720> what<00:02:17.930> we<00:02:18.080> do<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.560> this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
technique and what we do in this

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.090 
technique and what we do in this
function<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.600> have<00:02:20.900> another<00:02:21.140> video<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.830> so

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
function I have another video on this so

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.650 
function I have another video on this so
if<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.370> want<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.760> back<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.090> refer<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.360> that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
if you want to go back and refer to that

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.180 
if you want to go back and refer to that
is<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:25.300> have<00:02:26.530> strengths<00:02:27.530> or<00:02:27.680> our<00:02:27.770> overall

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
is we have strengths or our overall

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.060 
is we have strengths or our overall
string<00:02:28.550> once<00:02:28.730> again<00:02:30.010> what<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.160> want<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:33.070> what

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
string once again what you want to what

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.280 
string once again what you want to what
you<00:02:34.220> want<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.490> replace<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.360> for<00:02:35.810> example<00:02:36.230> in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
you want to replace so for example in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.949 
you want to replace so for example in
this<00:02:36.440> case<00:02:36.740> we<00:02:37.370> will<00:02:37.520> be<00:02:37.760> supply<00:02:38.150> monkey<00:02:38.720> in

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
this case we will be supply monkey in

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.140 
this case we will be supply monkey in
there<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:40.010> we're<00:02:40.160> choosing<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.640> replace

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
there because we're choosing to replace

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.199 
there because we're choosing to replace
with<00:02:41.420> monkey<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.890> then<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.550> would<00:02:43.700> choose<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
with monkey and then we would choose the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.470 
with monkey and then we would choose the
position<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> start<00:02:46.040> position<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:47.330> we'd

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
position the start position that we'd

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.710 
position the start position that we'd
want<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.750> start<00:02:48.110> replacing<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.600> this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
want to start replacing up so in this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.990 
want to start replacing up so in this
case<00:02:51.130> let's<00:02:52.130> go<00:02:52.250> back<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.640> original

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
case let's go back to the original

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.930 
case let's go back to the original
example<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.720> cat<00:02:54.170> sat<00:02:54.500> on<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> mat<00:02:54.770> it<00:02:55.700> would

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
example of a cat sat on the mat it would

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.400 
example of a cat sat on the mat it would
be<00:02:56.090> 0<00:02:56.480> 1<00:02:56.900> 2<00:02:56.930> 3<00:02:57.970> we'd<00:02:58.970> be<00:02:59.090> starting<00:02:59.360> at<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.080> third

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
be 0 1 2 3 we'd be starting at the third

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.030 
be 0 1 2 3 we'd be starting at the third
position

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
position

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.340 
position
so<00:03:02.000> we'd<00:03:02.150> Pier<00:03:02.420> 2<00:03:02.780> 2<00:03:02.930> 3<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:05.480> then<00:03:05.750> say

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
so we'd Pier 2 2 3 and there we then say

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.650 
so we'd Pier 2 2 3 and there we then say
how<00:03:06.620> many<00:03:06.680> characters<00:03:07.100> we<00:03:07.700> want<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.090> cut<00:03:08.630> off

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
how many characters we want to cut off

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
how many characters we want to cut off
and<00:03:09.320> then<00:03:10.010> add<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:10.730> string<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:12.380> in<00:03:12.530> this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
and then add this string in so in this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.610 
and then add this string in so in this
case<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.250> would<00:03:13.459> be<00:03:13.519> 3<00:03:13.640> also<00:03:14.480> because<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.410> want

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
case it would be 3 also because we want

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.690 
case it would be 3 also because we want
to<00:03:15.830> get<00:03:16.459> rid<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.870> 3<00:03:17.870> characters<00:03:18.489> starting<00:03:19.489> from

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
to get rid of 3 characters starting from

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.600 
to get rid of 3 characters starting from
the<00:03:19.850> third<00:03:20.060> position<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:22.100> we<00:03:22.310> want<00:03:22.489> to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
the third position and we want to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.930 
the third position and we want to
replace<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.209> with<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.690> text<00:03:24.080> monkey<00:03:24.590> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
replace that with the text monkey and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.759 
replace that with the text monkey and
this<00:03:25.940> will<00:03:26.120> be<00:03:26.209> shifted<00:03:26.630> along<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:27.820> above<00:03:28.820> and

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
this will be shifted along to above and

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.620 
this will be shifted along to above and
allow<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.610> know<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.790> have<00:03:31.940> more<00:03:32.209> than<00:03:32.360> one

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
allow you you know to have more than one

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.420 
allow you you know to have more than one
more<00:03:32.989> than<00:03:33.110> three<00:03:33.380> characters<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.130> obviously

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
more than three characters so obviously

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.800 
more than three characters so obviously
monkeys<00:03:35.330> at<00:03:35.510> six<00:03:35.810> characters<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:38.299> in<00:03:38.630> this

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
monkeys at six characters so in this

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.150 
monkeys at six characters so in this
example<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.650> use<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:41.079> substring<00:03:42.079> replace

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
example I use the substring replace

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.440 
example I use the substring replace
function<00:03:43.750> where<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.780> could<00:03:45.140> have<00:03:45.290> just<00:03:45.680> used

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
function where I could have just used

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.220 
function where I could have just used
STR<00:03:47.450> replace<00:03:49.420> now<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.480> reason<00:03:50.930> I'm<00:03:51.049> doing

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
STR replace now the reason I'm doing

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.660 
STR replace now the reason I'm doing
this<00:03:51.380> is<00:03:51.769> simply<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.730> demonstrate<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:55.370> use

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
this is simply to demonstrate the use

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.140 
this is simply to demonstrate the use
that<00:03:56.000> substring<00:03:56.810> function<00:03:57.110> can<00:03:57.560> have<00:03:57.590> if<00:03:58.190> you

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
that substring function can have if you

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.380 
that substring function can have if you
wanted<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.720> create<00:03:59.930> um<00:04:00.320> a<00:04:01.040> script<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.209> did

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
wanted to create um a script that did

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.590 
wanted to create um a script that did
this<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:03.709> could<00:04:04.070> just<00:04:04.370> use<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.030> string

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
this you could just use the string

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.350 
this you could just use the string
replace<00:04:05.920> function<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.940> would<00:04:08.090> be<00:04:08.239> able

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
replace function and you would be able

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.030 
replace function and you would be able
to<00:04:08.570> use<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.049> in<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.260> way<00:04:09.380> I've<00:04:09.530> already<00:04:09.709> talked

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
to use it in the way I've already talked

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.330 
to use it in the way I've already talked
about<00:04:10.900> however<00:04:11.900> I'm<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.010> go<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.220> long

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
about however I'm going to go the long

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.039 
about however I'm going to go the long
way<00:04:13.400> around<00:04:13.579> things<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.299> tutorial<00:04:14.900> and

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
way around things in this tutorial and

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.500 
way around things in this tutorial and
talk<00:04:15.739> about<00:04:15.920> how<00:04:16.400> we're<00:04:16.549> using<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.849> substring

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
talk about how we're using the substring

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.479 
talk about how we're using the substring
replace

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
replace

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.129 
replace
it's<00:04:18.819> just<00:04:19.030> going<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.269> give<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.449> an<00:04:19.539> idea<00:04:19.660> of

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
it's just going to give you an idea of

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.460 
it's just going to give you an idea of
how<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:20.949> work<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.400> your<00:04:21.549> program<00:04:22.060> and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
how it can work in your program and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.290 
how it can work in your program and
maybe<00:04:23.470> from<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.130> example<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:24.819> can<00:04:24.970> adapt

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
maybe from this example you can adapt

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.719 
maybe from this example you can adapt
and<00:04:25.509> use<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.110> your<00:04:26.169> own<00:04:26.380> uses<00:04:27.039> when<00:04:27.610> you

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
and use it in your own uses when you

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.559 
and use it in your own uses when you
feel<00:04:28.000> like<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.389> might<00:04:28.509> need<00:04:28.569> it<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:30.639> I'm<00:04:31.360> going

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
feel like you might need it so I'm going

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.930 
feel like you might need it so I'm going
to<00:04:31.660> get<00:04:31.780> rid<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.069> this<00:04:33.069> code<00:04:33.370> here<00:04:35.759> and<00:04:36.759> we're

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
to get rid of this code here and we're

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.629 
to get rid of this code here and we're
going<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.090> start<00:04:37.419> from<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.870> beginning<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
going to start from the beginning so the

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.159 
going to start from the beginning so the
first<00:04:39.880> thing<00:04:40.090> we<00:04:40.210> want<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.419> do<00:04:40.599> is<00:04:40.720> create<00:04:41.050> our

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
first thing we want to do is create our

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.120 
first thing we want to do is create our
form<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:43.000> let's<00:04:43.509> start<00:04:43.900> creating<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:47.130> we're

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
form so let's start creating that we're

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
search for now we can break down a

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.749 
search for now we can break down a
couple<00:06:00.190> more<00:06:00.310> lines<00:06:00.699> and<00:06:00.940> say<00:06:01.479> replace<00:06:02.020> with

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
form is can look so the input type in

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.480 
form is can look so the input type in
this<00:06:09.759> case<00:06:10.060> is<00:06:10.330> going<00:06:10.539> to<00:06:10.599> be<00:06:10.659> text<00:06:11.110> again<00:06:11.490> text
