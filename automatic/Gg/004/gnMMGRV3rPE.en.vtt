means<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.079> basically<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.530> comic<00:03:09.040> with<00:03:09.660> some

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
means is basically a comic with some

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.220 
means is basically a comic with some
sort<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.940> restriction<00:03:12.940> constriction<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.110> it
