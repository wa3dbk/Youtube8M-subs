00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.120 
through email maybe if this would work
if<00:04:24.120> not<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.720> guess<00:04:24.930> SMS<00:04:25.470> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
if not I guess SMS and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.560 
if not I guess SMS and
the<00:04:26.220> reason<00:04:26.490> it's<00:04:26.610> not<00:04:26.640> working<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:27.240> because

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
the reason it's not working is because

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.350 
the reason it's not working is because
just<00:04:27.840> with<00:04:27.960> iPhone<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:28.800> yeah<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:29.940> guess<00:04:30.210> you
