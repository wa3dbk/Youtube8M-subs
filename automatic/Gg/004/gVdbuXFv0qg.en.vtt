interesting for a number of reasons
number<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.890> uh<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.879> innovative

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
number one is that uh it's innovative

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
number one is that uh it's innovative
and<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.710> interesting<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.400> kind

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and and it's it's interesting just kind

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
and and it's it's interesting just kind
of<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.760> face<00:01:05.939> value<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> other<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
of at face value but the other thing is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
of at face value but the other thing is
let's<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.159> i<00:01:08.340> would<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.700> curious<00:01:08.909> if

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
let's think about i would be curious if

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
let's think about i would be curious if
you<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.530> place<00:01:10.770> only<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you think about this place only has a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.649 
you think about this place only has a
hundred<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.670> eighty<00:01:11.820> five<00:01:12.060> residents<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
hundred and eighty five residents so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
hundred and eighty five residents so
this<00:01:12.810> may<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> best<00:01:13.650> example<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.250> we

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this may not be the best example but we

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
this may not be the best example but we
could<00:01:14.520> still<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> hundred<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
could still kind of do it hundred and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
could still kind of do it hundred and
forty<00:01:16.140> thousand<00:01:16.590> dollar<00:01:16.770> mirror<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.369> wonder

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
forty thousand dollar mirror I wonder

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.359 
forty thousand dollar mirror I wonder
how<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> health<00:01:19.140> care<00:01:19.439> costs<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.340> be

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
how much in health care costs will be

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.179 
how much in health care costs will be
saved<00:01:20.850> over<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> life<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.200> mirror<00:01:22.680> by

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
saved over the life of that mirror by

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
saved over the life of that mirror by
having<00:01:23.670> sunlight<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.780> number<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.290> if

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
having sunlight right so number one if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.249 
having sunlight right so number one if

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
is certainly going to be mitigated by

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
is certainly going to be mitigated by

and do we know if this mirror in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
although if you look at the town if it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.110 
although if you look at the town if it
were<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.769> slightly<00:02:24.040> bigger<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.819> bigger

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
were just slightly bigger the bigger

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.030 
were just slightly bigger the bigger
area<00:02:25.629> would<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.840> outside<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.469> the<00:02:26.560> area<00:02:26.709> that's

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
time this is hypothetical I'm not saying

if<00:02:30.159> more<00:02:30.370> people<00:02:30.519> lived<00:02:30.849> here<00:02:30.939> but<00:02:31.359> if<00:02:31.450> you

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
if more people lived here but if you

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.569 
if more people lived here but if you
applied<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.230> artificial<00:02:32.829> sunlight<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.400> then

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
applied this artificial sunlight so then

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.309 
applied this artificial sunlight so then
it<00:02:33.700> gives<00:02:33.909> us<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.329> broader<00:02:34.599> question<00:02:35.170> which

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
it gives us the broader question which

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.879 
it gives us the broader question which
is<00:02:36.010> how<00:02:36.430> else<00:02:36.760> can<00:02:37.450> modifying<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.379> natural

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
is how else can modifying the natural

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.629 
is how else can modifying the natural
climate<00:02:39.549> or<00:02:39.700> lighting<00:02:40.650> affect<00:02:41.650> health<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.400> we

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
climate or lighting affect health and we

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.849 
climate or lighting affect health and we
know<00:02:42.819> we<00:02:43.180> know<00:02:43.329> about<00:02:43.480> health<00:02:43.840> issues<00:02:44.290> for

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
know we know about health issues for

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.129 
know we know about health issues for
people<00:02:44.920> who<00:02:45.280> work<00:02:45.489> nights<00:02:46.180> night<00:02:46.659> shifts<00:02:47.019> in

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
people who work nights night shifts in

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.629 
people who work nights night shifts in
sleep<00:02:47.349> during<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> day<00:02:47.859> and<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.400> know<00:02:48.519> about

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
sleep during the day and we know about

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.949 
sleep during the day and we know about
health<00:02:48.849> issues<00:02:49.239> for<00:02:49.389> people<00:02:49.450> who<00:02:49.720> live<00:02:49.870> in

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
health issues for people who live in

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.270 
health issues for people who live in
places<00:02:50.319> where<00:02:50.439> you<00:02:50.500> might<00:02:50.650> have<00:02:50.709> months<00:02:51.099> at<00:02:51.189> a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
places where you might have months at a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.490 
places where you might have months at a
time<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.639> no<00:02:51.819> daytime<00:02:52.480> at<00:02:52.599> all<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.349> think

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
time with no daytime at all so I think

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.750 
time with no daytime at all so I think
that<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.859> just<00:02:54.069> opens<00:02:54.340> up<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.519> lot<00:02:54.639> of

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
that this just opens up a lot of

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.119 
that this just opens up a lot of
interesting<00:02:55.120> things<00:02:55.180> yeah<00:02:55.930> uh<00:02:56.439> and<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.069> know

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
interesting things yeah uh and I know

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.429 
interesting things yeah uh and I know
large<00:02:57.639> mirrors<00:02:58.239> are<00:02:58.480> expensive<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.169> couldn't

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
large mirrors are expensive but couldn't

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.460 
large mirrors are expensive but couldn't
they<00:02:59.500> just<00:02:59.530> have<00:02:59.889> piece<00:03:00.459> together<00:03:00.700> uh<00:03:01.470> smaller

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
they just have piece together uh smaller

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.460 
they just have piece together uh smaller
mirrors<00:03:03.120> save<00:03:04.120> some<00:03:04.299> money<00:03:04.569> well<00:03:04.959> what

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
mirrors save some money well what

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.170 
mirrors save some money well what
wouldn't<00:03:05.769> those<00:03:05.950> mirrors<00:03:06.370> together<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
wouldn't those mirrors together and the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.670 
wouldn't those mirrors together and the
connecting<00:03:07.659> of<00:03:07.750> them<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:08.109> cost<00:03:08.349> about<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
connecting of them have cost about a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.319 
connecting of them have cost about a
