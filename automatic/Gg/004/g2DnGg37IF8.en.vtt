00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.200
 good morning community friends 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 nothing today we will show the device 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.050
 more modern than garmin 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.080
 the garmin min 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.880
 is a gps device that carries in the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.360
 we carry virtually all 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 parameters of the bicycle speed 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.910
 heart rate distance 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.200
 the cadence 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.030
 and of course, all the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.840
 functionalities of 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 of gps you can see the maps well today 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.610
 let's show the devices the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.520
 sensors that it carries 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 this device here you can observe 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.680
 It is a sensor that is placed in the bushing 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 rear 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.720
 simply decorated with a rubber band 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.060
 subject to buffet 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.060
 and as you will see then 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.360
 when turning the wheel 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.079
 We can observe 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.829
 well another sensor that we also have is 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.829
 what we see here in the crank 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.020
 What does the data of the cadence of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.140
 pedaling 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.179
 well a novelty and a difference 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.210
 also about other types of sensors is 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.300
 that as you see here in the back there is no 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.410
 no magnet on the radios 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.030
 and as you can see here the connecting rod 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.760
 happens in the box there is no magnet 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.920
 neither is that because these two 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.120
 sensors therefore work through a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.220
 gyroscope system 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.210
 turns on itself and sends the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.159
 information to the wing back 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.159
 Well that's it
