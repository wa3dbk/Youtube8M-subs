00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.520
 with daniel godoy who told us a 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.680
 little the panorama of citroën dark in 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.300
 this first semester of the year and we 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.699
 I counted that good you were going to us 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.630
 detail different options you have 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.060
 filter in dark exclusively to be able 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.470
 access the vehicle prematurely or 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.410
 be faster than usual 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.509
 the ph is advanced we know 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.369
 pedal 6 if you want to review it for 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.009
 those viewers who did not see it 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.020
 before you know you work late 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.940
 again like the one little danny in 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 the idea or identity of pea 6 and everything 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.140
 what is financing if we are 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.119
 focused on the delivery of the vehicle if 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.910
 the plans shatters and we no longer have 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.050
 already exceed that sixth quota or 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.620
 be that we are selling it as 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.930
 adjudicated 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.650
 the average fee is a 2700 quota 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.320
 pesos 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.780
 if you multiply them by 34 you almost get 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.960
 is giving 92 thousand pesos but we have it 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.060
 to a promotion of 85 thousand pesos if the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.940
 customer with that value can already take the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.350
 vehicle without draw without tender and with 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.960
 a fee before canceling a fee 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.150
 factory and without interest is obviously the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.730
 that to pass in clean a person who 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.440
 is interested in removing the unit by 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.870
 it usually fits in a circle or 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.270
 in a savings plan you have to wait for 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.480
 that plan is grouped and in the game 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.550
 second installment can do the 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.440
 award in this case is already a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.090
 vehicle that is already to adjudicate for 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.860
 be delivered the vehicle is already 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900
 awarded what is done is put together the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.490
 credit folder with administration and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.710
 already good the delay of the vehicle that is 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.360
 Afternoon with factory you can select 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.850
 the color and the version is not going to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.410
 bids is already awarded that is 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.540
 a derivative a bank financing 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.950
 but without interest as for the client 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.420
 go directly by the car which is what 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.800
 that Daniel was talking about we are 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.390
 focused on that in delivering the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 vehicle the doors are from the circles 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.260
 hydroven are pre-cancelable fees on 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.720
 customer can directly advance 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 yes so it does not go through financial or 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 the important thing 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.710
 s that within the range citroën which 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.050
 are the vehicles that are incorporated 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.160
 in this subject we have everything that is 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.140
 the line c-3 to 303 picasso c4 is stable 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.550
 He launched what we are not delivering 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.370
 we are focused more than anything on what 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.200
 is from c4 c5 and ds3 that are vehicles 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.480
 imported after the national range and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.670
 the vehicles are the whole range 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.570
 with no problem berlin govern and no 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.570
 form is also in real 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.300
 is one of the concerns that we 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.490
 manifest viewers of the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.280
 program has to do with the delivery to 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.620
 Sometimes good by color or by model usually 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.170
 have delays in deliveries how is 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.000
 handling dark the subject of stock and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.500
 delivery of units as in reality 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.420
 that with the issue of deliveries no no 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.210
 we have problems and the line can 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.800
 choose the whole line c-3 c3 picasso from 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.710
 archers like year counting new line 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.080
 berlingo line c-4 launch can choose 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.060
 Two colors factory stock of reality 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.680
 that there is without the idea of ​​that is also 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.780
 always with the client try to take out 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.670
 that fear that no vehicles 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.380
 everything that is seen or heard all the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.970
 reality that there is this year we are 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.220
 we're fine with deliveries and we're 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.140
 delivering the car in a timely manner 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.630
 more than anything the tranquility of the client 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.070
 that in that sense the battery problem 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.890
