 by a debutante Darío Benedetto 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 the playmaker who arrives from national had 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.110

 Finish with the head that could not place 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190
 at that time I would have left 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.780
 possibilities to the back appears as the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789

 for the teams that are going to be 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.330
 obviously disputing this opportunity 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.560
 to stay the maximum circuit 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.320
 veracruz that is the team that has 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.170
 more volatility in this in this

 to walk suffering in this contest the y os 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.959
