to<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> point<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> working<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.239> three<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
to the point way of working out three to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.950 
to the point way of working out three to
four<00:01:00.539> sets<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:01.020> 275<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> flat<00:01:02.160> bench<00:01:02.690> 62<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.210 
four sets with 275 on a flat bench 62 I
think<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> max<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.010> 13<00:01:05.430> reps<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
think the max was like 13 reps right so

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.899 
think the max was like 13 reps right so
