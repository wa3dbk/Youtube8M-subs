00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
absolutely absolutely true yeah a bit of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.929 
absolutely absolutely true yeah a bit of
cloth<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.210> he<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
cloth just as he there so this one I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.140 
cloth just as he there so this one I
believe<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> first<00:01:22.890> time<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.700> saw<00:01:23.909> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
believe was the first time we saw a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
believe was the first time we saw a
six-man<00:01:24.630> team<00:01:24.869> win<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.380> believe<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> may<00:01:26.549> have

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
six-man team win I believe it may have

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.010 
six-man team win I believe it may have
been<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> first<00:01:27.119> time<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.720> otherwise

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
been the first time because otherwise

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.560 
been the first time because otherwise
that<00:01:28.439> setup<00:01:28.890> has<00:01:29.100> done<00:01:29.340> statistically<00:01:30.240> very

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that setup has done statistically very

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.950 
that setup has done statistically very
poorly<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.799> worked<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> major<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
poorly what worked for the major it it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
poorly what worked for the major it it
was<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.590> clever<00:01:35.009> their<00:01:35.280> setup

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
was actually really clever their setup

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
was actually really clever their setup

to<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> scimitars<00:02:14.400> put<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.820> deep<00:02:15.060> into<00:02:15.240> armor

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to the scimitars put it deep into armor

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.140 
to the scimitars put it deep into armor
within<00:02:16.320> seconds<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.070> there's<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.760> no<00:02:17.940> time

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
within seconds and there's just no time

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.760 
within seconds and there's just no time
for<00:02:18.360> cohabit<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.840> compensate<00:02:19.290> from<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:19.620> on

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
for cohabit to compensate from then on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.940 
for cohabit to compensate from then on
it<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.570> tank<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.050> team<00:02:22.290> but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it was it was the tank of the team but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
it was it was the tank of the team but
the<00:02:23.130> team<00:02:23.340> needed<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.700> tank<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.870> thats

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
the team needed to tank for it so thats

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.080 
the team needed to tank for it so thats
in<00:02:25.290> Matar<00:02:25.560> really<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.370> keystone<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
in Matar really was the keystone of the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.060 
in Matar really was the keystone of the
team<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.480> once<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> fell<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.710> was<00:02:28.770> only<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
team and once it fell it was only a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.490 
team and once it fell it was only a
matter<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.370> time<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:30.990> interesting

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
matter of time and so interesting

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.960 
matter of time and so interesting
because<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.070> such<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> long<00:02:32.670> stalemate

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
because we have such a long stalemate

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.620 
because we have such a long stalemate
and<00:02:33.420> such<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> small<00:02:34.800> detail<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.610> having<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
and such a small detail as having to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.000 
and such a small detail as having to
pull<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.050> drones<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.470> because<00:02:37.740> someone

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
pull your drones in because someone

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.410 
pull your drones in because someone
shooting<00:02:38.280> at<00:02:38.400> them<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:38.760> completely<00:02:39.120> flipped

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
shooting at them just completely flipped

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.150 
shooting at them just completely flipped
the<00:02:39.480> mat<00:02:39.600> you're<00:02:39.780> out<00:02:39.870> absolutely<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.010> was

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the mat you're out absolutely it was

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.770 
the mat you're out absolutely it was
clever<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.610> mean<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:42.060> everybody<00:02:42.300> would<00:02:42.570> note

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
clever I mean not everybody would note

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.240 
clever I mean not everybody would note
not<00:02:43.020> everybody<00:02:43.410> wouldn't<00:02:43.740> notice<00:02:43.920> that

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
not everybody wouldn't notice that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.890 
not everybody wouldn't notice that
especially<00:02:44.640> from<00:02:44.790> an<00:02:44.880> FC<00:02:45.210> standpoint<00:02:45.690> so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
especially from an FC standpoint so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.010

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
props to agni it was very clever and we

props to agni it was very clever and we
saw<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.530> basilisk<00:02:50.070> which<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.790> traditionally

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
saw a basilisk which is traditionally

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.850 
saw a basilisk which is traditionally
used<00:02:53.330> for<00:02:54.330> cap<00:02:54.720> transferring<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.230> well<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
used for cap transferring as well and it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.650 
used for cap transferring as well and it
was<00:02:56.040> indeed<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.790> saw<00:02:56.940> Tengu<00:02:57.360> doing

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
reppin what was this this cycle setup

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.050 
reppin what was this this cycle setup
they<00:03:00.900> had<00:03:01.020> going<00:03:01.170> oh<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.980> was<00:03:02.070> just<00:03:02.100> yeah<00:03:02.550> like

you said they had the the other puzzle
us<00:03:04.680> there<00:03:04.890> purely<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.550> cup<00:03:05.910> transfer<00:03:06.330> they

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
us there purely for cup transfer they

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.800 
us there purely for cup transfer they
had<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.290> t3<00:03:08.220> Tengu<00:03:08.790> acting<00:03:09.480> there<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
had the t3 Tengu acting there is a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.350 
had the t3 Tengu acting there is a
logistic<00:03:10.290> ship<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.670> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.150> it's

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
logistic ship and it's kind of like it's

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.630 
logistic ship and it's kind of like it's
a<00:03:12.450> little<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.190> play<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.520> would

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
a little bit of a play on what you would

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.330 
a little bit of a play on what you would
usually<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:15.120> because<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.890> throws

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
usually do because it just it throws

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.530 
usually do because it just it throws
people<00:03:17.370> off<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.970> think<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.300> there's<00:03:18.510> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
people off you think are there's a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.640 
people off you think are there's a
buzzer<00:03:18.720> lyst<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.110> it's<00:03:19.290> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> be<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
buzzer lyst there it's going to be a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.110 
buzzer lyst there it's going to be a
little<00:03:19.739> more<00:03:19.830> rapid<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.340> all<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:20.820> doing<00:03:20.970> is

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
little more rapid and all it's doing is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.270 
little more rapid and all it's doing is
just<00:03:21.180> feeding<00:03:21.540> Cup<00:03:21.810> whereas<00:03:22.440> you've<00:03:22.590> got<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.800> t3

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
just feeding Cup whereas you've got a t3

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.130 
just feeding Cup whereas you've got a t3
with<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.550> really<00:03:23.910> heavy<00:03:24.060> tank<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:25.019> can

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
with a really heavy tank that can

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.750 
with a really heavy tank that can
support<00:03:25.440> itself<00:03:25.800> pretty<00:03:26.040> much<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.430> long<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:26.670> it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
support itself pretty much as long as it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.420 
support itself pretty much as long as it
has<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.910> cut<00:03:27.150> from<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.360> basilisk<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:29.220> just

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
has a cut from the basilisk and it just

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.530 
has a cut from the basilisk and it just
worked<00:03:29.580> really<00:03:29.790> well<00:03:29.880> because<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.360> don't

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
worked really well because you don't

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.259 
worked really well because you don't
know<00:03:30.600> which<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:30.959> go<00:03:31.110> for<00:03:31.140> 1st<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.269> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
know which one to go for 1st and the

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.470 
know which one to go for 1st and the
with<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.780> drones<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.709> work<00:03:34.890> from<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> drones

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
with the drones the work from the drones

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.210 
with the drones the work from the drones
from<00:03:36.480> agony<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.080> taking<00:03:37.769> out<00:03:37.860> cry<00:03:38.010> havoc
