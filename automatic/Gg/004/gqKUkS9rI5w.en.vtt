00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 channels I will cure dates today are here for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 give you 2 xbox one news as you said 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.760
 in the title which are the hard disks 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 external and sharing the real name 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.970
 we leave immediately with the first one that they are 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.489
 hard drives as we know of course 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.239
 the xbox one consists of a hard disk 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.250
 than 500 gb with the ddr3 memory then 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 from memory a little bit allen tuccia e 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.059
 this obviously besides the fact of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.270
 be a little slow a little 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 back in comparison to the other for 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 ps4 so dr5 as we know is a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.890
 memory that is occupied in anyway 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 operating systems that are 3 for xbox 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.449
 one and I only tell you that the systems 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 xbox one operating systems are three and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.000
 occupy 136 g the 135 if not me 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.769
 I never remember guys here already a lot of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.119
 fuck off memory evening 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.700
 so guys we have the chance to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 expand with external hard drives 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 obviously guys who were young 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.240
 great color song is either way 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 must be usb 3.0 pa which otherwise 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 of light of war no beautiful law runs 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.939
 campli harlan I know about 500 gig of a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.770
 terabytes of 20 of 3 terabytes 4 terabytes 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.130
 and guys now what do you want me to take 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.900
 the weather of advice always hard disk 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.240
 that they have no power because 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.610
 otherwise you will have to take the hard disk 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 with the range the xbox one connect 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.340
 the cold feeder and then yes 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.380
 a fucking girl creates a competition 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.729
 cavities around create tribeca veti that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.770
 they bother you so you don't 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.299
 advice and so I defend ardis instead 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.430
 so small that maybe they are more 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.740
 comfortable 500 a terabyte 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.409
 and then of course if you need it if 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.210
 you are the game buyers but 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.549
 you really buy a lot 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.439
 keep the installations all of the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.250
 game installations then vi 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.110
 council of I do not know d 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.209
 buy a station of from 4 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 terabytes with the power supply 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.530
 connected by leaving them this we say 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.230
 that a good is a good suggestion is a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.209
 good is a great excuse to buy 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.800
 a hard disk because it is like anyway 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.860
 we know they are starting to tear 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.410
 some world watch dog titles all 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.489
 other old titles of the output 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.739
 ladies box one 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.180
 so guys buy yourself nardis maybe 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.910
 to also found in offers does not have 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.040
 found one from pisa one terabyte those 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.370
 Filipinos ultras 20 own toshiba 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.160
 samsung stuff like that and they cost on 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.650
 70 euros ie not a low price though 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.750
 in the end for a good terabyte computer 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.610
 and think that if you have the chance though 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.400
 will see excellent economic possibility of 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.170
 buy an ssd that would be a unit a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.989
 solid state that is much faster 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.660
 of the classic hdd remembered the classics 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.170
 hard drives DDR3 DDR5 if that is not 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.150
 also discussed ps3 and ps 4 I recommend 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.560
 to buy the one that costs one 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.540
 little more we say not a 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.209
 little bit nice pole for it 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.060
 look for it 500 gig of the ssv of the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.000
 samsung and what about 200 euros on amazon 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.060
 boys and it's a memory still on the tour 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.889
 fast enough and I read 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.739
 also on the internet informing me a 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.209
 little more than what many have 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.100
 opened they took away the seal of 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.590
 xbox one guarantee to install the 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.100
 place of the ddr 3 of 500 gig that has us 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.130
 already inside the xbox one a ssd of 500 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.380
 gb is obviously the speed of 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.870
 loading is enough day is 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.359
 remarkable fast and much more well-known miss 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.700
 sui turns around 10 seconds these 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.160
 cone in less than loading on any 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.600
 play on any story that's on 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.310
 xbox one 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.350
 so guys you have the chance that 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.799
 I advise you to lose an ssd of the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.389
 samsung which are really very good 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.280
 the attack at 170 euros must however 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.590
 look well because it does not buy 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.560
 quite demanding 200 euros 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.840
 if you think about it, add it to 100 or 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.060
 200 euros has covered the ps4 as I could 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.209
 in fact I will probably take a 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.890
 3 hard drives have this take a 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.829
 one terabyte hard disk amp 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.709
 when I have more titles we say at the launch 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.780
 is more titles on xbox one is then nothing 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.120
 guys we say this is the whole thing 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.460
 new that there are on xbox one the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.680
 sharing the name obviously isn't there 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.870
 I need to explain to you what is needed 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.850
 you have friends if you want to do so a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.020
 times share with your friends that 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.700
 person you know your real name 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.740
 he adds, put it on, guys 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.210
 obviously sharing the real name 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.729
 it is exclusive to the people you are 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.229
 not for everyone you can choose the 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.919
 people who can see yours 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.840
 real name luca as I am 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.580
 francesco alessando chicca I don't know 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.889
 for the other boys 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.880
 so let's say a feature is 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.440
 quite useless in my opinion, guys 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.539
 and previously on customization 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.139
 of the profile that just to see before 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.350
 if I'm not mistaken it should be on 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.550
 personal profile personalization 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.560
 customization at buthan exchange 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.419
 player image is change that the 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.889
 target the guys on this change 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.710
 player image would do me a lot 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.729
 pleasure that microsoft allowed me 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.280
 to put in place of that fucking 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.349
 put however both giant titan and 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.030
 I have shown that because he had me 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.220
 seen on his box May temple glove 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.289
 cia the flame eye could 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.389
 to put an image is mine but that 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.060
 it would be a lot more film in my opinion 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.630
 then of course xbox one for something 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.039
 I'll have to use this fucking end 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.349
 camera that takes photos in full hd or 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.289
 united to find ie we do not agree 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.750
 on this boys that is obvious a home of 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.700
 of full hd camera that does not mif 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.340
 watch to be sky but maybe to do 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.650
 some photos to publish on xbox one 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.599
 no you can't guys it will take 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.130
 at least two more three years before 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.900
 being able to do it then guys this is 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.970
 all about xbox one we can 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.740
 submit is on this new one 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.259

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.110
 I had received in advance for not it

 say also have updates every case 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.780

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.840
 get in it but I like it anyway 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.389
 both try it previewed bullshit 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.130
 end the hard disk is also useful in 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.259
 sharing of the truth no less than some 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.789
 less and no kids then the cure 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.289
