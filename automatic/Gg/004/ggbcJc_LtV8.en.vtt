00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone today I have to show you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.580
 this combo that we had been so long 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.929
 waiting in the world for the type tweets 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.670
 shows the 4x4 mirror that I was already wearing 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.410
 several months that I heard that they were 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.969
 selling in Mexico and in fact several 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.400
 people asked me if I had already 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 seen how he was if he knew he has the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 designer but no matter how hard they search 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 information in the forum of type tweets 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.570
 shows I did not find anything and in fact the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 members of that forum told me that the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.609
 only person that they knew there was 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.399
 tried to make one was try phone the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.739
 famous Thai designer but that the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.469
 same try phone had said that his cube 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.750
 it turned so bad that he had decided not to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.579
 produce it to an inventory and in other 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 Internet pages I saw that there was another 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.340
 cube that looked like a fear of the 4x4 but 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.989
 it was actually a three by three with the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.719
 pieces are stuck together to make it look like 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.370
 4x4 but obviously it works out 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.680
 like in three for three successes like that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.239
 that joke then I had many 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 doubts because the designer of this well 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.370
 it is not was not a known designer and not 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.530
 I thought I could have made a cube that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.960
 he betrayed sincerely 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.299
 but good at the end of the day I decided 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 to try it and go surprise because it is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.320
 a beautiful cube in every way 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.630
 to start the box I liked it a lot 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 has like a letter j I've done the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 initial of the designer but I do not know if that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 has been the reason why to do this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.300
 design but I like that from outside 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.300
 you can see a part 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.570
 good 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.250
 it's super nice the pieces are super 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.250
 well done everything parejito and apart 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.030
 tour super good 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.170
 neither big a bit heavy but it's 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.260
 which it is a modification handmade I 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.600
 bring up some piece brings 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.400
 long 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.820
 the signature of the Lord here is 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.170
 and there is the signature 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.119
 there are actually you can see the piece the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.080
 original piece and how it spread with 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.500
 epoxy here I have the original cube of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.950
 that was removed is a modification of its 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.680
 4x4 show and see the comparisons of 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.920
 sizes so we can see what is the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 increase 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.890
 what is the increase in size 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.690
 and in fact the centers 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.700
 they are still the same size where 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.130
 that increase was of all layers 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.090
 something very funny external to this cube 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.849
 is that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.370
 the centers have no difference 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.680
 colors like in a normal cube 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.599
 as normal we know that always put 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.099
 blank the yellow is proposed in the 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.140
 red angel always put on blue 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.900
 green and that for example if you have the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.430
 up always on the right side is in 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.209
 the red on his left side farm 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.099
 etcetera etcetera 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.390
 here there is no problem to be able to 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.250
 move the centers and here yes 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.720
 that we have no color reference to the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.450
 only reference we have are about 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.580
 sizes because all centers have 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.250
 a different depth as well 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.569
 say it but you need to learn 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.640
 what to analyze it ok the center more 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.430
 small on this side in relation to the more 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.470
 big that goes to this other side and so on 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.090
 but I created truth retaliate the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.400
 part of the joke because if you do not 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.530
 Solve just like a normal 4x4 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.980
 then my recommendation for those 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.050
 what they buy is that as soon as I arrived 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.959
 bravely they do not get upset 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.239
 to analyze what they were going to pour fun and 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.580
 the first one is that I put it together I put all the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.620
 bad centers you realize they're 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.050
 bad center until I want to get the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.660
 corner and the pair df 12 and because 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.400
 only one side of a couple are left 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.530
 for the other rule for example if I 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.070
 I would have put this center and this other 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.980
 the other way around I'm going to keep something like that he's 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.989
 of 2 l of this side would have to auto 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.570
 parejito but this side has been me 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.790
 obvious that this center there are no cows and 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.920
 just like this other center more 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.340
 we are moving and we are 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:19.359
 discovering how how to build it 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:24.370
 and well now I'm going to stir for 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:28.240
 that we see that it is a juice 100% functional 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.680
 and while the commotions I tell them that 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.440
 the designer is proudly Mexican 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.690
 but he has remained anonymous 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.220
 because he is not interested in selling if 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.490
 interesting to see later because he does not want 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.680
 to do what he wants is to design and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.630
 take charge of your design so someone 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.870
 more in the flesh of the cumbersome benthos 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:57.160
 and the only store where they can 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.800
 get in that and rubik store xalapa 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.470
 because I think that has and the designer 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.430
 has an exclusivity agreement 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.800
 so 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.490
 God, I'm going to leave the league in 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.660
 description 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.220
 so that for those who are interested 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.610
 in acquiring they put in contact with 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.710
 this store the price currently 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:26.199
 January we are now in January 2015 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:30.460
 will continue at 1200 pesos and from 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:33.759
 February have been breast-1350 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.120
 pesos if they live in mexico the price 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.190
 international is 100 dollars 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.590
 hands anywhere in the world 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.249
 that alone they have to put on 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.869
 contact with them 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:46.440
 and good if you want to see something of the 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:49.710
 designer 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.140
 maybe it will be called by the acronym jg om 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.700
 I will also leave a description 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.510
 in the video I say a league in the 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.210
 description of the video sorry 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.020
 I do not know if they want to follow it and go see 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.020
 what else is going 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.990
 Well here you can see what it is 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.420
 completely optional moves for 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.180
 everywhere in the description too 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:16.170
 I'm going to leave the league to another video in 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.090
 where I do a soft I put it in another video 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.340
 because I know there are people who have 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.170
 start buying it and already some do not 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.700
 they like to see how someone solves it 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:29.130
 more like to have no idea of 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.060
 how to solve it and try it on its own 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:36.510
 same and well I recommend it to 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.600
 100% is fun and it's a well 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.070
 incredible to add to the collection 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.550
 thank you very much for watching and see you in 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.550
 another video
