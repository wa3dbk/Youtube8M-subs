00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.010
 hey people welcome to one 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.139
 round blog hand the new game mode me 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.490
 I'm a melon and we'll be together now 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 search for a place here 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.699
 that's kind of a hide and seek and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 It went pretty well. Milk package something 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 bothers me something's go say here in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.170
 that can be a good place for us 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 hide well and the hunters 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.200
 visit 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.579
 I hope so and nobody sees this here 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 make me a little ugly because then we will 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.870
 That we do not die so much when we die 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 are all up here 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.600
 it comes then I already have a round 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.600
 played and it should be hers during the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.180
 gameplay again and again such a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.449
 message combinatorial much as many hand it 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.859
 live here or aunt slips ghs 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 you had really hard because you have to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.100
 just find whole types here that is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.689
 not so easy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.400
 So who does not know this game that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.020
 It is easy to explain that it is so 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 a kind of hide and seek yes play it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 actually play hide and seek 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
 there is always this search and then 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.159
 So there are these , for example me 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 I'm the one who has to hide 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.630
 You always get that way then you are 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.400
 someday blog I am now one 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.240
 Melone and there you have to be here 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.240
 hide and hand that must be 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.939
 samsung is a relatively simple principle and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.630
 if you die then you are yourself 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.470
 Hunter 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.170
 so it may think I define ok 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.770
 is it full wcdma I have to go too 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.090
 note 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.500
 the server apps are also available 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.009
 description if you are on it yourself 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.409
 now wants to play the night here 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.840
 lobby it looks quite good from the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.579
 always the same map but that was bad 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.520
 because it is so the victory in the pocket 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.950
 edition and who would have thought that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.740
 it is already possible 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.369
 By the way, we can also do these hunters 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.439
 kill 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.490
 that is also possible but we have 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.920
 no armor that's why I'll do that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.900
 our situation was enormous so now it was on 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.940
 dark for whatever reason 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.940
 it is a bit boring because there is nothing here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.530
 we say we can do it to you 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.069
 attack again here comes this now 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.519
 report 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.440
 the life is still 6 block types more or 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.090
 less and three hand that four minutes 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.470
 I am certainly still hiding 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.370
 not just continue where I like you 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.030
 but also want to show how to after the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.510
 players can search 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.970
 ok so from the view of the hunter so can 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.049
 man's definition is all up here 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.049
 make here 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.790
 hello, they are not going to pay me 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.459
 do not understand it because you have many 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.099
 it is possible for each other 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.209
 that someone hides you who wants who 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.079
 in any case, a theory is here 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.079
 already one died 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.130
 ok i hope they dont find me you 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.080
 are you sleeping / that you have the credits 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:21.520
 help yes I have no such 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.820
 ok , our direction nourishes no 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.900
 please do not please do not please no no 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.140
 yes okay is in the right direction 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.540
 so not to me 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.280
 all of which are also something here forward 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.990
 slowly boring I 'm coming now 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.830
 I do not give a shit I try 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.830
 now to be able to 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.420
 even this did not matter 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.940
 damn I'm mentally can come yes yes 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.250
 died a bit again 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.980
 We should also be such a hunter of hunter 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.870
 Johanna had so I can give you this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.980
 So everything from this point of view also 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.830
 have to show it for a short time so look now 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.230
 if someone is hiding somewhere and 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.030
 I pack so eternally we can have 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.570
 Often someone hides so 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.470
 have to 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.140
 I would always in such cases, we 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.850
 to go here if someone redial is 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.310
 then I want to be here right now 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.480
 Also look something here somewhere 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.230
 one is normal 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.970
 I think nobody is possible here 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.310
 is everything 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.930
 look here maybe someone is 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.760
 sometime in the roof up or so but 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.120
 so that the young ones come 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.790
 But we had a barrel before 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.530
 That's how high games come about 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.210
 not sure i do not think so 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.270
 but we can also have a look 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:59.570
 maybe someone a woodblock me 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.570
 I think I'll pack again 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.889
 I do not think anyone else here 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.690
 but you know it's actually her much 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.910
 mocking the map ok long ago planned into 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.870
 internet world 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.180
 okay the server restart in 30 minutes 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.010
 can we not care you need geh'n 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.610
 we are a scully's in here 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:28.979
 maybe that one page is weird 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:32.780
 from here perhaps still throw somewhere 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.780
 my theory is actually none 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.100
 keep looking for myself but you can 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.690
 never be sure that these guys 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.470
 hide no once in 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.470
 in this house 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.440
 I think nobody is hiding anymore 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.310
 to be really good 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.310
 we already know that somewhere 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.630
 be solid because now be funny but 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.310
 I think I'm finally coming 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:21.740
 again here in the house 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:23.180
 a little strange is the blocks okay 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.920
 have won so pretty much 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.510
 well then what is it with this 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.530
 round 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.180
 if you like the video and vice 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.950
 if you could do it easier then I would say 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.150
 See you again at the next video I 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.150
 I 'll take care of it
