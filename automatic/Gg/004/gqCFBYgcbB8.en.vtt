look<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> realized<00:00:52.320> why

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
look right and then I realized why

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.799 
look right and then I realized why

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
this is a very nice combination this

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.689 
this is a very nice combination this
vehicle<00:04:47.930> because<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> lot<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:49.069> times<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.520> buy

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
vehicle because a lot of times you buy

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.510 
vehicle because a lot of times you buy
like<00:04:49.939> say<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.300> regular<00:04:50.780> q5<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.979> you've<00:04:52.370> got

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
like say the regular q5 and you've got

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.790 
like say the regular q5 and you've got
the<00:04:52.639> turbo<00:04:52.969> four-cylinder<00:04:53.750> it's<00:04:54.259> good<00:04:54.439> on<00:04:54.560> gas

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
the turbo four-cylinder it's good on gas

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.709 
the turbo four-cylinder it's good on gas
but<00:04:55.219> it<00:04:55.310> doesn't<00:04:55.580> have<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:55.729> dynamic<00:04:56.419> feel

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719
