plus it's completely open so I was

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
plus it's completely open so I was
always<00:00:38.160> scared<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.820> somebody<00:00:39.180> would<00:00:39.300> grab

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

happened<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> me<00:00:41.969> before<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.140> feel<00:00:43.500> more

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
happened to me before but I do feel more

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.190 
happened to me before but I do feel more
comfortable<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.940> put<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.270> wallet<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
comfortable if I can put my wallet in a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
comfortable if I can put my wallet in a
compartment<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> zipper<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> was

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
compartment with a zipper so I was

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
compartment with a zipper so I was
browsing<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> internet<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> noticed<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
browsing on the internet and noticed the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
browsing on the internet and noticed the
GST<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> ground<00:00:51.180> shopping<00:00:51.660> tote<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
GST the ground shopping tote and I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
GST the ground shopping tote and I
thought<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> would<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.370> better<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.879> me

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
thought it would be much better for me

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
thought it would be much better for me
so<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.239> went<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> Chanel<00:00:55.140> store<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> tried

so I went to the Chanel store and tried
that<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.149> ended<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.660> really<00:00:58.199> liking<00:00:58.440> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
I had to get used to the size because

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349
