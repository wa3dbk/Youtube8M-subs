00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
compartment and that's about it I'm not

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.010 
compartment and that's about it I'm not
sure<00:06:57.830> for<00:06:58.220> all<00:06:58.310> record<00:06:58.910> videos<00:06:59.389> using<00:06:59.690> this

sure for all record videos using this

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.460 
sure for all record videos using this
camera<00:07:00.560> as<00:07:01.270> although<00:07:02.270> technically<00:07:03.110> it<00:07:03.320> does

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
camera as although technically it does

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.290 
camera as although technically it does
have<00:07:03.650> better<00:07:03.860> specifications<00:07:04.820> than<00:07:05.120> my

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
have better specifications than my

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.490 
have better specifications than my
current<00:07:05.750> camera<00:07:07.180> I'm<00:07:08.180> not<00:07:08.450> sure<00:07:08.720> that<00:07:09.140> it

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
current camera I'm not sure that it

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
current camera I'm not sure that it
would<00:07:09.620> do<00:07:09.830> as<00:07:10.010> well<00:07:10.250> as<00:07:11.050> normally<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.520> camera

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
would do as well as normally a camera

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.440 
would do as well as normally a camera
that<00:07:14.150> takes<00:07:14.419> videos<00:07:15.880> normally<00:07:16.880> isn't<00:07:17.030> as<00:07:17.270> good

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
that takes videos normally isn't as good

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.580 
that takes videos normally isn't as good
as<00:07:17.750> a<00:07:17.979> worst<00:07:19.060> video<00:07:20.060> camera<00:07:20.600> but<00:07:21.110> its<00:07:21.260> primary

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590 
as a worst video camera but its primary

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.640 
as a worst video camera but its primary
function<00:07:22.280> is<00:07:22.460> her<00:07:23.030> video<00:07:23.289> generally<00:07:24.289> anyway

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
function is her video generally anyway

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.770 
function is her video generally anyway
I'll<00:07:25.160> do<00:07:25.460> some<00:07:25.669> tests<00:07:26.060> so<00:07:26.510> if<00:07:26.630> you're

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780 
I'll do some tests so if you're

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.379 
I'll do some tests so if you're
interested<00:07:27.320> in<00:07:27.410> a<00:07:27.560> review<00:07:27.860> then<00:07:28.580> comment<00:07:29.150> down
