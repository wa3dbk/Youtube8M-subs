00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
iphone and blackberry and so this you

it's<00:04:05.120> not<00:04:05.359> i<00:04:05.629> guess<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.900> supported<00:04:06.409> device<00:04:06.680> so

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
it's not i guess a supported device so

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.240 
it's not i guess a supported device so
archos<00:04:07.879> is<00:04:08.000> having<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.299> do<00:04:08.420> their<00:04:08.599> own<00:04:08.629> thing

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
archos is having to do their own thing

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.050 
archos is having to do their own thing
so<00:04:10.250> as<00:04:10.489> soon<00:04:10.670> as<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.200> comes<00:04:12.200> up<00:04:12.349> we<00:04:12.799> can<00:04:12.980> tap<00:04:13.909> on
