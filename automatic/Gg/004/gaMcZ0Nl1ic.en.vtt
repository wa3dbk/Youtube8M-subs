00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.880 
red golden days I definitely remember
those<00:01:42.630> days<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.560> quite<00:01:43.770> unfortunate

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
those days and it's quite unfortunate

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.450 
those days and it's quite unfortunate
you<00:01:44.310> can't<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:45.409> any<00:01:46.409> hiding<00:01:46.740> videos<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you can't really do any hiding videos on

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.760 
you can't really do any hiding videos on
Halo<00:01:47.670> 4<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.689> most<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> hiding

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
Halo 4 really because most of the hiding

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.859 
Halo 4 really because most of the hiding
spots<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.820> blocked<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> teamed<00:01:51.720> up

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
spots are like blocked and teamed up

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
spots are like blocked and teamed up
with<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:53.009> quite<00:01:53.220> unfortunate<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.000> there

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with so it's quite unfortunate and there

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
with so it's quite unfortunate and there
are<00:01:54.479> still<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> few<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.649> hiding<00:01:56.070> spots<00:01:56.310> but

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
are still a few little hiding spots but

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
are still a few little hiding spots but
they're<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.030> good<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.600> were<00:01:57.659> back<00:01:58.259> in

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
they're not as good as they were back in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.179 
they're not as good as they were back in
Halo<00:01:58.649> 3

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
Halo 3

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.480 
Halo 3
back<00:01:59.790> when<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.630> hidden<00:02:00.899> masters<00:02:01.290> found<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
back when the hidden masters found the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
back when the hidden masters found the
first<00:02:02.909> hiding<00:02:03.270> spots<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.780> decided<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> make

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
first hiding spots and decided to make

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.010 
first hiding spots and decided to make
youtube<00:02:04.500> videos<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.329> halo<00:02:06.329> 3<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.689> still<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
youtube videos so halo 3 is still the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
youtube videos so halo 3 is still the
best<00:02:07.140> game<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.069> had<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.700> most<00:02:08.910> fun

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.990 
for a halo 2 anniversary which I'm not
sure<00:03:03.989> if<00:03:04.080> they're<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.560> because<00:03:04.760> halo<00:03:05.760> 5

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
sure if they're gonna do because halo 5

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.610

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
is coming out next year on the Xbox one

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.809 
is coming out next year on the Xbox one
so<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.130> game<00:03:08.280> should<00:03:08.459> be<00:03:08.550> really

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
so that game should be really

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.140 
so that game should be really
interesting<00:03:09.330> I'm<00:03:09.989> interested<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.650> how

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
interesting I'm interested to see how

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.340

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
343 will take this game since they're

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.570 
343 will take this game since they're
gonna<00:03:13.500> take<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> learning<00:03:14.160> experience

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
gonna take the learning experience

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
gonna take the learning experience
they've<00:03:14.730> learned<00:03:15.030> from<00:03:15.150> me<00:03:15.569> hila<00:03:15.989> for<00:03:16.290> onto
