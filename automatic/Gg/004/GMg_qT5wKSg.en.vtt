this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> an<00:00:17.039> X<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.400> model<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.029> front

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
this is an X I model it has a front

transfer case as well as transmission
fluid<00:00:20.670> I'll<00:00:21.449> probably<00:00:21.750> break<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.439> into

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
fluid I'll probably break this up into

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.650 
fluid I'll probably break this up into
three<00:00:22.769> videos<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.820> may<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.449> generic

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
three videos so this may be the generic

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
three videos so this may be the generic
beginning<00:00:25.289> clip<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.680> each<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
beginning clip for each I'm going to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.800 
beginning clip for each I'm going to
start<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> differential<00:00:27.449> oil<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
start with the differential oil so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.390 
start with the differential oil so
that'll<00:00:28.019> probably<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> first<00:00:28.769> upload<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that'll probably be the first upload and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.009 
that'll probably be the first upload and
then<00:00:29.760> we'll<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:29.970> subsequent<00:00:30.480> uploads<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
then we'll have subsequent uploads of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.780 
then we'll have subsequent uploads of
the<00:00:31.170> following<00:00:31.470> fluids<00:00:31.769> I'm<00:00:32.340> also<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the following fluids I'm also going to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.389 
the following fluids I'm also going to
be<00:00:32.969> replacing<00:00:33.390> most<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.219> all

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
be replacing most of the or if not all

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.020 
be replacing most of the or if not all
of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> drain<00:00:36.420> plugs<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:37.079> well<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> copper

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
of the drain plugs as well as the copper

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
of the drain plugs as well as the copper
washers<00:00:39.930> gaskets<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:42.120> also<00:00:43.079> got

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
washers gaskets in there and I also got

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
washers gaskets in there and I also got
this<00:00:43.800> fluid<00:00:44.789> transfer<00:00:45.149> pump<00:00:45.390> over<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
this fluid transfer pump over here that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.529 
this fluid transfer pump over here that
I'll<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.190> using<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.850> motive

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
I'll kind of be using from motive

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.160 
I'll kind of be using from motive
products<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> power<00:00:49.379> fill<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.020> how

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
products to power fill so to see how

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
products to power fill so to see how
that<00:00:52.320> does<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.250> point<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> video

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that does at this point in the video

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600 
that does at this point in the video
moving<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> transmission<00:00:55.440> fluid<00:00:55.980> we

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
moving on to the transmission fluid we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
moving on to the transmission fluid we
need<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> front<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> car<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> air

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
need the front of the car up in the air

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
need the front of the car up in the air
this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.890> manual<00:00:59.399> transmission<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
this is a manual transmission this is a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.660 
this is a manual transmission this is a
5-speed<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> 6-speed<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.160> oh<00:01:02.250> three

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
5-speed the 6-speed was I think oh three

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.590 
5-speed the 6-speed was I think oh three
and<00:01:03.090> later<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> no<00:01:04.019> tune<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and later this is a no tune so it's a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
and later this is a no tune so it's a
very<00:01:06.869> different<00:01:07.080> procedure<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.950> will

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
very different procedure and this will

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
very different procedure and this will
only<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.520> applicable<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> those<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> who

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have a clutch front of the car up in the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.859 
have a clutch front of the car up in the
air<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.140> use<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> front<00:01:13.770> Jack<00:01:14.040> point<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:15.030> have

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

removed<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.439> three<00:01:16.920> underbelly<00:01:17.640> splash

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
removed all three underbelly splash

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.320 
removed all three underbelly splash
shields<00:01:19.460> there's<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> front<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the back of the transmission it might be

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
the back of the transmission it might be
possible<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.630> only<00:01:24.840> need<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> remove

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
possible that you only need to remove

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.780 
possible that you only need to remove
the<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> back

the one all the way in the back
for<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> transmission<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.710> took<00:01:28.829> all

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
for the transmission but I just took all

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280 
for the transmission but I just took all
of<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> center<00:01:30.780> Jack<00:01:31.020> point

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
of them down use the center Jack point

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.719 
of them down use the center Jack point
to<00:01:31.409> Jack<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.400> stands

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to Jack it up and then put it on stands

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
to Jack it up and then put it on stands
make<00:01:33.030> sure<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.360> safe<00:01:33.810> before<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.259> crawl

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
make sure it's safe before you crawl

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
make sure it's safe before you crawl
under<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:34.970> with<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.329> known<00:01:36.540> I'm

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
under there with all of that known I'm

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.910 
under there with all of that known I'm
going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> crawl<00:01:36.990> under<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> car<00:01:37.470> now<00:01:37.680> we'll

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
going to crawl under the car now we'll

socket on that break that free and take

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.820 
socket on that break that free and take
it<00:02:25.670> out<00:02:25.880> before<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.810> touch<00:02:27.140> your<00:02:27.290> drain<00:02:27.590> bolt

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
it out before you touch your drain bolt

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.640 
it out before you touch your drain bolt
same<00:02:28.130> thing<00:02:28.340> with<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.580> diff<00:02:28.990> if<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.530> your

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
same thing with the diff if you get your

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.410 
same thing with the diff if you get your
drain<00:02:30.890> bolt<00:02:31.100> out<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.520> all<00:02:31.610> your<00:02:31.790> fluid<00:02:32.180> out

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
and then this break this bolt breaks or

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.810 
and then this break this bolt breaks or
for<00:02:35.810> some<00:02:35.930> reason<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.200> can't<00:02:36.470> get<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.770> out<00:02:36.950> you

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
for some reason you can't get it out you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.700 
for some reason you can't get it out you
just<00:02:38.000> bricked<00:02:38.270> your<00:02:38.450> car<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.930> there's<00:02:39.170> no<00:02:39.290> DFU

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
just bricked your car and there's no DFU

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.900 
just bricked your car and there's no DFU
mode<00:02:39.740> for<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.250> BMW<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.540> we've<00:02:42.290> gotten<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.910> fill

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
mode for a BMW so we've gotten the fill

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.550 
mode for a BMW so we've gotten the fill
bolt<00:02:44.120> out<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:44.510> we're<00:02:44.660> going<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.810> break<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
bolt out now we're going to break the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.170 
bolt out now we're going to break the
drain<00:02:45.830> bolt<00:02:46.010> free<00:02:46.250> keep<00:02:46.460> in<00:02:46.730> mind<00:02:46.970> we<00:02:47.150> should

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
drain bolt free keep in mind we should

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.090 
drain bolt free keep in mind we should
be<00:02:47.600> draining<00:02:47.900> according<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.800> internet

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
be draining according to the internet

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.550 
be draining according to the internet
about<00:02:49.520> 1.1<00:02:50.030> quarts<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.900> certainly<00:02:51.290> looks<00:02:51.500> like

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
about 1.1 quarts it certainly looks like

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.550 
about 1.1 quarts it certainly looks like
it<00:02:51.740> would<00:02:51.830> take<00:02:52.010> more<00:02:52.160> than<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> guess

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
it would take more than that so I guess

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.960 
it would take more than that so I guess
we're<00:02:54.710> going<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:54.890> live<00:02:55.190> dangerously<00:02:55.700> have

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
we're going to live dangerously have

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.170 
we're going to live dangerously have
your<00:02:56.120> fill<00:02:56.330> already<00:02:56.750> run<00:02:57.220> your<00:02:58.220> oil<00:02:58.490> pan<00:02:58.850> oil

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
your fill already run your oil pan oil

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.420 
your fill already run your oil pan oil
drain<00:02:59.660> pan<00:02:59.900> below<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.440> we'll<00:03:01.130> get<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.370> out

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
drain pan below that we'll get that out

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.120 
drain pan below that we'll get that out
so<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.270> got<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.570> 17<00:03:03.110> middle<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.680> way<00:03:03.830> and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
so we got that 17 middle of the way and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.540 
so we got that 17 middle of the way and
we<00:03:04.760> were<00:03:04.910> greeted<00:03:05.330> with<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.690> geyser<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.650> brown

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
we were greeted with a geyser of brown

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.700 
we were greeted with a geyser of brown

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
before I get this first two hundred and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.940 
before I get this first two hundred and
fourteen<00:03:11.690> thousand<00:03:12.020> miles

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.390 
knows maybe 30,000 miles since it's been
done<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:21.320> can<00:03:21.470> never<00:03:21.620> change<00:03:21.709> fluid<00:03:22.250> too

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
done you can never change fluid too

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.820 
done you can never change fluid too
often<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.300> I<00:03:23.570> don't<00:03:23.720> regret<00:03:23.959> doing<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.709> it

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
often so I don't regret doing it but it

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.470 
often so I don't regret doing it but it
certainly<00:03:25.190> was<00:03:25.489> not<00:03:25.580> as<00:03:25.760> bad<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.180> thought<00:03:26.209> it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
certainly was not as bad as I thought it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
certainly was not as bad as I thought it
would<00:03:26.570> be<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:26.780> we're<00:03:26.870> going<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.020> let<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.290> drip

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
would be so we're going to let that drip

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.100 
would be so we're going to let that drip
clean<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.070> moment<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:29.330> we'll<00:03:29.480> install<00:03:29.810> a

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
clean for a moment then we'll install a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.690 
clean for a moment then we'll install a
new<00:03:30.500> hardware<00:03:30.890> I'll<00:03:31.100> get<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.340> some<00:03:31.520> part

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
new hardware I'll get you some part

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.670 
new hardware I'll get you some part
numbers<00:03:32.000> on<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.810> then<00:03:33.410> we're<00:03:33.500> going<00:03:33.530> to

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
numbers on that and then we're going to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.380 
numbers on that and then we're going to
use<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:33.950> tool<00:03:34.160> as<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.580> mentioned<00:03:34.880> before<00:03:34.940> to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
use that tool as I mentioned before to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.770 
use that tool as I mentioned before to
replace<00:03:36.230> about<00:03:36.860> 1.1<00:03:37.459> quarts<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.120> here<00:03:38.390> using

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
replace about 1.1 quarts up here using

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.440 
replace about 1.1 quarts up here using
the<00:03:38.900> fill<00:03:39.430> hole<00:03:40.430> until<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.090> starts<00:03:41.360> to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
the fill hole until it just starts to

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.140 
the fill hole until it just starts to
run<00:03:41.690> over<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.800> front<00:03:43.070> end<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.430> car<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.910> up

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
run over the front end of the car is up

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970 
run over the front end of the car is up
in<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.390> air<00:03:44.420> right<00:03:44.570> now<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.110> we<00:03:45.200> may<00:03:45.410> not<00:03:45.590> get<00:03:45.920> a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
in the air right now so we may not get a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.800 
in the air right now so we may not get a
totally<00:03:46.580> accurate<00:03:46.700> reading<00:03:47.300> but<00:03:47.480> it'll<00:03:47.720> be

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
totally accurate reading but it'll be

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.770 
totally accurate reading but it'll be
close<00:03:47.989> enough<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:49.300> we'll<00:03:50.300> tighten<00:03:50.480> both<00:03:50.750> of

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
close enough and we'll tighten both of

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.390 
close enough and we'll tighten both of
these<00:03:50.959> down<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.200> think<00:03:51.380> these<00:03:51.590> are<00:03:51.739> 45<00:03:52.130> pound

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
these down I think these are 45 pound

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.920 
these down I think these are 45 pound
feet<00:03:52.640> as<00:03:52.760> well<00:03:52.940> then<00:03:53.540> we'll<00:03:53.690> be<00:03:53.780> done<00:03:53.870> with

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
feet as well then we'll be done with

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.340 
feet as well then we'll be done with
this<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.830> here's<00:03:55.160> our<00:03:55.250> new<00:03:55.430> bolt<00:03:56.320> for<00:03:57.320> the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
this so here's our new bolt for the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.440 
this so here's our new bolt for the
drain<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.709> fill<00:03:57.769> they're<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.190> same<00:03:58.430> bolt

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
drain and fill they're the same bolt

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.080 
drain and fill they're the same bolt
it's<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.440> standard<00:04:01.190> bolt<00:04:01.459> which<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:01.970> a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
it's a standard bolt which just a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.250 
it's a standard bolt which just a
threaded<00:04:02.420> end<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:02.750> goes<00:04:02.930> into<00:04:03.140> the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
threaded end that goes into the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.750 
threaded end that goes into the
transmission<00:04:03.650> verses<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.250> differential

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
transmission verses the differential

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.390 
transmission verses the differential
bolt<00:04:04.940> which<00:04:05.150> was<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.390> female<00:04:05.959> bolt<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.250> keep

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
bolt which was a female bolt like I keep

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.759 
bolt which was a female bolt like I keep
all<00:04:07.610> like<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:08.050> but<00:04:09.050> our<00:04:09.140> new<00:04:09.260> part<00:04:09.500> number

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
all like that but our new part number

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:10.490 
all like that but our new part number
and<00:04:10.040> when

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
and when

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.920 
and when
22r<00:04:11.280> part<00:04:12.060> number<00:04:12.300> is<00:04:12.480> 2<00:04:12.840> 7<00:04:13.290> 1<00:04:13.320> 1<00:04:13.710> 1<00:04:13.920> 2<00:04:14.340> 2<00:04:14.370> 6<00:04:14.880> 7<00:04:15.540> 9<00:04:15.870> 8

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
22r part number is 2 7 1 1 1 2 2 6 7 9 8

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.170 
22r part number is 2 7 1 1 1 2 2 6 7 9 8
and<00:04:16.470> there's<00:04:16.769> no<00:04:16.920> washers<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.400> these<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.970> is

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
and there's no washers on these this is

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.400 
and there's no washers on these this is
the<00:04:18.269> transmission<00:04:18.840> fluid<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.170> we're<00:04:19.290> going

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
the transmission fluid that we're going

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.259 
the transmission fluid that we're going
to<00:04:19.470> be<00:04:19.530> using<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.160> royal<00:04:20.940> purple

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
to be using it's just royal purple

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.620 
to be using it's just royal purple
synchro<00:04:21.750> max<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.260> synthetic

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
synchro max and synthetic

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.200 
synchro max and synthetic
high-performance<00:04:24.630> manual<00:04:25.050> transmission

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
high-performance manual transmission

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.800 
high-performance manual transmission
fluid<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.640> manual<00:04:29.880> transmission

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
fluid so this is manual transmission

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.740 
fluid so this is manual transmission
fluid<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.260> have<00:04:31.440> two<00:04:31.740> quarts<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:33.300> we're

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
fluid I have two quarts of it and we're

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.300 
fluid I have two quarts of it and we're
just<00:04:33.840> using<00:04:34.050> this<00:04:34.380> was<00:04:34.920> this<00:04:35.100> thing<00:04:35.280> called

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
just using this was this thing called

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.820 
just using this was this thing called
avid<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.240> don't<00:04:36.840> know<00:04:36.900> we're<00:04:37.260> using<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.620> and

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
avid I don't know we're using this and

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.020 
avid I don't know we're using this and
it's<00:04:37.920> one<00:04:38.070> well<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.370> far<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:38.760> we're<00:04:38.850> going<00:04:38.940> to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
it's one well so far so we're going to

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.180 
it's one well so far so we're going to
keep<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.300> up<00:04:39.390> okay<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.560> was<00:04:40.740> actually

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
keep it up okay so this was actually

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.080 
keep it up okay so this was actually
really<00:04:41.400> easy

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
really easy

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.970 
really easy
we<00:04:42.360> used<00:04:42.510> our<00:04:42.630> tool<00:04:42.840> again<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:43.320> probably<00:04:43.500> put

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
we used our tool again we probably put

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.740 
we used our tool again we probably put
in<00:04:44.160> maybe<00:04:44.610> close<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.570> half

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
in maybe close to the one and a half

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.570 
in maybe close to the one and a half
quarts<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.680> hope<00:04:46.830> that's<00:04:47.070> not<00:04:47.160> because

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
quarts and I hope that's not because

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.990 
quarts and I hope that's not because
we're<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:48.060> little<00:04:48.540> bit<00:04:48.660> of<00:04:48.780> an<00:04:48.870> angle<00:04:49.110> right<00:04:49.560> now

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
we're a little bit of an angle right now

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.510 
we're a little bit of an angle right now
I<00:04:51.000> put<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.050> new<00:04:52.260> fill<00:04:52.620> pulled<00:04:52.890> in<00:04:53.040> we<00:04:53.280> torque

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
I put the new fill pulled in we torque

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.060 
I put the new fill pulled in we torque
that<00:04:53.640> down<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:54.030> 45<00:04:54.510> pounds<00:04:54.780> as<00:04:55.050> well<00:04:55.260> love

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
that down to 45 pounds as well love

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.370 
that down to 45 pounds as well love
including<00:04:56.370> those<00:04:56.700> tool<00:04:56.970> isn't<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.510> avid<00:04:57.960> it

will<00:04:58.500> take<00:04:58.680> let's<00:04:59.400> take<00:04:59.490> some<00:04:59.850> time<00:04:59.880> to

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
will take let's take some time to

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.710 
will take let's take some time to
correct<00:05:00.210> myself<00:05:00.420> it's<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.900> motive<00:05:02.120> from<00:05:03.120> ECS

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
correct myself it's the motive from ECS

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.800 
correct myself it's the motive from ECS
and<00:05:04.280> valve<00:05:05.280> Auto<00:05:05.490> has<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.970> as<00:05:06.150> well<00:05:06.390> so<00:05:06.750> I

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
and valve Auto has this as well so I

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.909 
and valve Auto has this as well so I
thought<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.080> give<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.290> a<00:05:07.350> try<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.650> it's

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
thought to give it a try and it's

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.030 
thought to give it a try and it's
proving<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.310> be<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.700> really<00:05:09.030> great<00:05:09.150> tool<00:05:09.450> so

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
proving to be a really great tool so

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.140 
proving to be a really great tool so
pretty<00:05:11.040> simple<00:05:11.220> job<00:05:11.610> changing<00:05:12.060> the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
pretty simple job changing the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.540 
pretty simple job changing the
transmission<00:05:12.480> fluid<00:05:12.900> with<00:05:13.260> synchro<00:05:13.980> max<00:05:14.220> and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
transmission fluid with synchro max and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.580 
transmission fluid with synchro max and
I<00:05:15.540> think<00:05:15.810> we're<00:05:15.900> going<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.080> move<00:05:16.230> on<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.500> the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
I think we're going to move on to the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.780 
I think we're going to move on to the
transfer<00:05:17.070> case<00:05:17.100> now<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.669> being<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:18.330> 330<00:05:18.960> X<00:05:19.350> i

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
transfer case now this being a 330 X i

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.159 
transfer case now this being a 330 X i
we<00:05:20.790> have<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:20.910> transportation<00:05:21.660> we<00:05:21.750> have<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.870> front

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
we have a transportation we have a front

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.750 
we have a transportation we have a front
if<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.650> don't<00:05:22.830> have<00:05:22.919> any<00:05:23.070> fluid<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.520> front

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
if I don't have any fluid to the front

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.460 
if I don't have any fluid to the front
depth<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.120> do<00:05:24.180> have<00:05:24.600> what<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.900> transfer<00:05:25.320> case

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
depth I do have what the transfer case

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.440 
depth I do have what the transfer case
needs<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:25.979> it's<00:05:26.100> a<00:05:26.190> very<00:05:26.669> small<00:05:27.090> amount<00:05:27.360> of

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
needs and it's a very small amount of

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.820 
needs and it's a very small amount of
fluid<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.919> guess<00:05:29.100> we'll<00:05:29.280> move<00:05:29.310> on<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.580> that
