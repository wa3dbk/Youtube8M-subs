are<00:04:18.459> only<00:04:18.609> two<00:04:18.970> things<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.419> can<00:04:19.690> do<00:04:19.840> when

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
are only two things you can do when

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.680 
are only two things you can do when
someone<00:04:20.470> says<00:04:20.680> you're<00:04:20.890> not<00:04:21.010> good<00:04:21.340> enough<00:04:21.690> you

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
someone says you're not good enough you

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.440 
someone says you're not good enough you
can<00:04:22.900> prove<00:04:23.140> them<00:04:23.320> right<00:04:24.030> or<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.150> can<00:04:25.270> prove

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
can prove them right or you can prove

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.830 
can prove them right or you can prove
them<00:04:25.540> wrong

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.040 

and<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.020> great<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:31.000> thought<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.690> almost

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
and that great and I thought it's almost

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.890 
and that great and I thought it's almost
good<00:04:32.440> if<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> critic<00:04:33.790> it's<00:04:34.540> almost

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
good if you have a critic it's almost

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.230 
good if you have a critic it's almost
good<00:04:35.260> if<00:04:35.560> someone<00:04:36.550> thinks<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:36.910> don't<00:04:37.090> measure

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
good if someone thinks you don't measure

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.600 
good if someone thinks you don't measure
up<00:04:37.389> it's<00:04:37.720> almost<00:04:37.900> good<00:04:38.320> if<00:04:38.590> you've<00:04:39.370> got<00:04:39.580> a

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
up it's almost good if you've got a

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.100 
up it's almost good if you've got a
little<00:04:39.760> chip<00:04:40.030> on<00:04:40.210> your<00:04:40.240> shoulder<00:04:40.389> it's<00:04:40.870> pretty

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
little chip on your shoulder it's pretty

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.440 
little chip on your shoulder it's pretty
good<00:04:41.290> it's<00:04:41.620> pretty<00:04:41.860> healthy<00:04:42.010> if<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:43.180> keep<00:04:43.360> it

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
good it's pretty healthy if you keep it

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.620 
good it's pretty healthy if you keep it

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
have something to prove that's why I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.659 
have something to prove that's why I
love<00:04:58.930> sports<00:04:59.320> because<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.950> analogies<00:05:00.400> are<00:05:00.430> so

readily at hand and it's such a great

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.700 
readily at hand and it's such a great
analogy<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.639> a<00:05:03.820> great<00:05:04.540> metaphor<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.350> life
