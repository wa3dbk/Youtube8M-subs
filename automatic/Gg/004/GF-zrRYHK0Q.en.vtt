00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.150 
really changed the way we manage
patients<00:02:08.730> over<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:08.940> past<00:02:09.150> five<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.540> ten<00:02:09.720> years

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
patients over the past five to ten years

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.220 
patients over the past five to ten years
and<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.850> definition<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> minimally

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and in the definition of minimally

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.630 
and in the definition of minimally
invasive<00:02:13.620> spine<00:02:13.740> surgery<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.310> basically

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
invasive spine surgery is basically

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.780 
invasive spine surgery is basically
trying<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.940> accomplish<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.570> same<00:02:15.780> goals<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
trying to accomplish the same goals of

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.650 
trying to accomplish the same goals of
stabilizing<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> spine<00:02:17.910> taking<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
stabilizing the spine taking the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.030 
stabilizing the spine taking the
pressure<00:02:18.840> off<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.320> spinal<00:02:19.680> cord<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
pressure off the spinal cord of the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.790 
pressure off the spinal cord of the
nerve<00:02:20.220> roots<00:02:20.460> by<00:02:21.210> using<00:02:21.810> smaller<00:02:22.260> incisions

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
nerve roots by using smaller incisions

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.760 
nerve roots by using smaller incisions
and<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.700> more<00:02:24.180> muscle<00:02:24.750> sparing<00:02:25.230> techniques

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
and and more muscle sparing techniques

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.410 
and and more muscle sparing techniques
basically<00:02:26.190> trying<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> preserve<00:02:26.610> your<00:02:27.120> soft

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
basically trying to preserve your soft

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.200 
basically trying to preserve your soft
tissues<00:02:27.840> preserve<00:02:28.680> your<00:02:28.830> muscle<00:02:29.190> tissues<00:02:29.610> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
tissues preserve your muscle tissues so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.600 
tissues preserve your muscle tissues so
that<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.630> recovery<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.110> much<00:02:31.260> faster<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
that your recovery is much faster and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.820 
that your recovery is much faster and
and<00:02:33.570> by<00:02:33.900> all<00:02:34.020> means<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.530> that's

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
and by all means that's that's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.110 
and by all means that's that's
definitely<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:37.020> correct<00:02:37.440> way<00:02:37.770> to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
definitely the the correct way to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.750 
definitely the the correct way to
proceed<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:40.650> essence<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> means<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.520> try<00:02:41.700> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
proceed it in essence it means to try to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.460 
proceed it in essence it means to try to
accomplish<00:02:42.140> more<00:02:43.140> by<00:02:43.410> doing<00:02:43.590> less<00:02:45.470> my

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
accomplish more by doing less my

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.750 
accomplish more by doing less my

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
techniques when I was in Houston and

techniques when I was in Houston and
practice<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.200> employed<00:02:52.500> those<00:02:53.430> techniques<00:02:53.760> on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
practice I employed those techniques on

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.880

there and the outcomes using those

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.130 
there and the outcomes using those

simple outpatient decompressions is

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.630 
simple outpatient decompressions is
typically<00:03:08.530> about<00:03:08.620> four<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.070> six<00:03:09.130> weeks<00:03:09.340> from

the larger fusion procedures it takes

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.400 
the larger fusion procedures it takes
about<00:03:11.620> three<00:03:11.950> months<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.930> when<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.200> say

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
about three months and and when I say

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.190 
about three months and and when I say
recovery<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.920> mean<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.940> getting<00:03:16.690> relatively

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
recovery I mean to getting relatively

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.860 
recovery I mean to getting relatively
back<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.530> 85<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.070> 90<00:03:18.280> percent<00:03:18.610> strength<00:03:18.940> most

of surgery or the day after surgery that

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.020 
of surgery or the day after surgery that
are<00:03:23.980> able<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.280> walk<00:03:24.460> five<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.820> ten<00:03:25.000> minutes

are able to walk five to ten minutes

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.780 
are able to walk five to ten minutes
within<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.570> week<00:03:25.780> after<00:03:26.230> surgery<00:03:26.550> thus<00:03:27.550> the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
within a week after surgery thus the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.440 
within a week after surgery thus the
recovery<00:03:28.570> is<00:03:28.600> relatively<00:03:29.050> quick
