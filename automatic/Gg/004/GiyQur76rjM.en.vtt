00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 as well as the pallium fire that is 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.970
 considered the cheapest car in the world today . 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.500
 Brazil, right? 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.110
 the cheapest entry car is fitch 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 also has the fate Hélia sale right 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.480
 she did not take this old model of the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.090
 siena of circulation now in 2014 she 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 adapted the airbags and abs required by 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 lei ne 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.840
 formerly these cars they came in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 with abs airbag as optional four 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.680
 years none 12 thousand beginning of the 2000 final 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 of the 90s and finally then that fiat did 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.719
 she went back to using these abs airbags 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 a single car that now as an item of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.260
 vacation right 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.410
 here in Brazil there is no law that requires 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 frontal impact collision tests 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 side 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.750
 finally the assemblers she 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 simply put a hostel there 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.829
 so worried if the car goes from 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.230
 form a collision because it has no 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.449
 a law that requires them to do so 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.420
 worry about the car body right 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.170
 with the structure of the car, that 's it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.939
 then these cars are not the pallium and siena 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.780
 still can not stay in the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.939
 market for a long time and this one a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.159
 difference in relation to the father he has 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.920
 the 1.4 engine option is not 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.759
 the siena 1.0 that put five people and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 Jewish luggage much of the 1.0 engine then the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.829
 version 1.4 is best suited for this 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 kind of car is that a trunk a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.790
 large luggage carrier né 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.090
 luciana has a big trunk so 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.130
 fits quite a lot of luggage with 1.0 engine goes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.329
 will suffer a little to take him with 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.000
 charge 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.670
 then this version 1.4 is more ideal for 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.229
 he the bad news is that fiat has launched 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.259
 already in May the 2015 version dsk and the bad 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.710
 The news is that it became more expensive, right? 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.079
 novelty, right? 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 now in 2014 car sales 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.250
 have decreased, so the number of 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.250
 price of the unit né to win more 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 then their profit margin remains 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.800
 practically the same because they neither 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.660
 any less 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.980
 they earn more then it is so 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.830
 it works 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.040
 then this new l is integrated into the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.180
 truth to 2014 here gives the fifa site 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.630
 so much is the price it is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.610
 unavailable are not updating it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.190
 earned a little something or other in relation 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.290
 to this 2014 version but nothing that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.370
 justified their increase in the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.080
 price is right 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.860
 he is now a trend in the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.930
 market is not green at the moment price 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.600
 all justified by inflation but 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.140
 you see they increase much more than 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.140
 that inflation is therefore, but ultimately to 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.530
 one client who is in a car with a 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.840
 silk with handbag and affordable price 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.290
 it will stay between 1 if ellie is a 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.690
 classic chevrolet corsa 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.850
 classic is the chevrolet's advantage in the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.010
 which is also very cheap, right? 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.330
 and that one only has the 1.0 engine option 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.810
 huh 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.110
 is a point by siena motor 1.4 compared 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.270
 with the classic chevrolet né 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.550
 but at last you do not have much to say 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.660
 not everyone knows much about this car. 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.110
 well this car 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.220
 I do not have to talk about it until 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.220
 next personal video
