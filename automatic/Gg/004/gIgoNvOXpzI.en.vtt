00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.559
 Hello I am Christian target and I will lead you this DVD 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.159
 the most beautiful sport in the world 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.589
 and from now on, mix her boyfriend in her 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.589
 I would like to give you some advice with my tips and tricks 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.939
 In the following training program FÃ¼nderich systematically by a man 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.000
 about immigrants 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.300
 Admission to the next upswing 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.450
 no matter if the beginners are advanced or more ambitious 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.410
 Kite surfer is simply plugged into the case with chapters and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.000
 participate 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.230
 It is important that she internalizes the tricks before he tries 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.770
 to put them on the water 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.050
 our goal is therefore the slow motion and precise explanations 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.540
 to present the tricks as understandable as possible 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.760
 Papke continues with 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 Of course you can do mental training anytime 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.790
 to hold back the evil 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.210
 and now have fun with this DVD and good luck! 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.650
 first start 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 after that no feeling is trained and perfected it goes with the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 Water instead of now on the word 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.060
 the lime is controlled with one hand and held in the zenith 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.039
 the other hand immediately the word 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.140
 and she therefore 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.620
 The feet slip firmly into the footsteps 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.620
 the knees remain tightly bent 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.960
 now concentration is war 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.150
 this is from 12 o'clock he is even an hour contrary to the planned trip 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.790
 Direction directed 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.960
 and from there he will with an intense steering movements in the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810
 planned trip crashed direction 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.290
 and develops pressure 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.350
 now from the middle of the body on the boat raise the kite consequences 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.650
 and get up slowly in the back leg 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.029
 burden the back leg 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.979
 and let it go slightly angled 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.469
 that calls for the most part by stretching 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.469
 and with the strain on his heels could continue 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.489
 and in the same way 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.489
 Now enjoy these first meters on the board 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.119
 Here in the total again nice to see 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.569
 move the careerist slightly in the opposite direction 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.659
 to rest 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.689
 and then fly intensively and deeply in the direction of travel 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.689
 and often even 45 degrees 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.969
 The further the kite is flown in the opposite direction 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.019
 that to Depth of the Dead Island are windows 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.499
 the deeper into the wind the village is the more pressure he builds on that means 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.809
 the lighter the more the KAC is made of gold 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.239
 that's how it should look like from your perspective 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.349
 dpa 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.409
 try the first water city it can be helpful the 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.090
 Sheetfed offset printing so you have a more stable posture 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.629
 Sion si will be 9 percent as nice to see here 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.499
 and to internalize here again
