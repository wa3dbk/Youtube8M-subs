00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.130
 so let's start the group 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.620
 response gets to 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.280
 year from the remote central observation 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 they are put forward on arrival 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.869
 on the object begins his examination 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
 survey how the rules begin 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.360
 entrance areas 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.520
 employees pushed to the door ledge 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.340
 when inspecting the door is desirable 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.750
 act on the principle I inspect you 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.750
 covering up 1 employee inspects 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 door on the subject of breaking squeezing 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.649
 damage to the hinge lock and so on 2 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.379
 the employee is located on the adjacent 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.399
 door pad and is monitoring 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.379
 territory his main task 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.039
 is to prevent a sudden 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.190
 assault by inspection 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.109
 entrance area is as follows 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.110
 act 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.840
 going to the door 2 employee locks it 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.870
 foot and checks for closeness not 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.120
 removing weapons when arising 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.780
 extreme situation or attempt 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.520
 criminals break through the door 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.570
 gbr officer can safely block 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.210
 and note for a short time 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.240
 arm that the first that 2 employee 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.360
 constantly controls the weapons in 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.330
 otherwise the crucial moment of it 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.940
 just may not get it because of the factor 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.250
 surprise this element 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.220
 need to vaccinate employees on 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.100
 each workout is an extension for 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.450
 further inspection of the object is done by 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 team 2 employee 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.370
 when inspecting the perimeter staff 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.460
 extended by a ledge with an interval of 2 3 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.550
 meters from each other 1 employee 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.390
 extends away from the wall 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.540
 45 meters and in front of 2 employees who 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.620
 moves a meter and a half away from 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 walls this distance allows 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.270
 control each other and at the same time 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.430
 if the attack does not become 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.980
 group goal 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.969
 each employee is assigned his 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.569
 inspection sector 1 employee examines 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:39.510
 second floor windows and the next 2 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.379
 Officer checks the windows of the first floor and 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.989
 also the door around the perimeter of the object is special 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.439
 pay attention to both the employee on 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:53.000
 main signs of penetration 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:56.250
 we list their development of surveillance cameras 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.730
 damage windows lattices or their 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.519
 opening door breaking 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.370
 the presence of rope hanging from the roof traces 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.669
 on the fire escape the wandering light from 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.299
 flashlight in the windows when 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:15.329
 passing corners 1 employee having examined 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.480
 the area around the corner gives the command to the second 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.159
 nomination officer 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.349
 2 employee independently 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.409
 stops for two two and a half 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.409
 meters to the intersection of the corner and waiting for the team 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.540
 at 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.570
 the fall from the corner of the attacker will 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.600
 see only one employee in this 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.810
 case, the principle of split 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.020
 goals namely stretch attention 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.730
 striker on the front shifting slightly 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.490
 backwards 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.890
 everyone is not recommended 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.550
 detain immediately without evaluation 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.680
 environments such assault detentions 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.400
 often ended in live or 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.849
 gunshot wounds 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.549
 when naked 2 employee criminal 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.610
 most cases do not have time quickly 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.879
 analyze the situation and for some 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.439
 time loses initiative and what can 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.439
 take advantage of the gbr staff 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.690
 when damage is detected, the output 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.350
 zone 2 employee gives the command to the first 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.240
 and the perimeter violation team must 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.380
 be clear he moves away to the corner of the building 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.050
 initial advancement 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.830
 back forward constantly controlling 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.350
 front door 1 employee moves forward to 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.370
 the other side of the perimeter and takes under 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.800
 control your sector is desirable so that 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.400
 both employees were in the zone 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.889
 visual contact perimeter control 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.479
 and problem areas 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.630
 carried out before the arrival of the responsible 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.630
 persons
