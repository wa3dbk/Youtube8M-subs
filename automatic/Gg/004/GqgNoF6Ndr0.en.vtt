to<00:00:17.279> work<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.869> usually<00:00:18.869> that's<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> case

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to work with usually that's not the case

brake lever when my hand is on the end

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
brake lever when my hand is on the end
of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> handle<00:01:24.299> bar<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
of the handle bar like this just just

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
of the handle bar like this just just
one<00:01:25.950> finger<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.520> brakes<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:26.909> good

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
one finger because these brakes are good

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
one finger because these brakes are good
enough<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> won't<00:01:27.630> need<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:27.930> whole<00:01:28.080> hand

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
enough that I won't need my whole hand

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.950 
enough that I won't need my whole hand
to<00:01:29.009> break<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.939> people<00:01:30.180> prefer<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.750> two

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to break some people prefer to use two

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
to break some people prefer to use two
fingers<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.470> other<00:01:31.619> fingers<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> break<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
fingers or other fingers to break and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
fingers or other fingers to break and
they<00:01:33.240> might<00:01:33.450> end<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.689> sliding<00:01:34.140> their<00:01:34.380> brake

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
they might end up sliding their brake

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.550 
they might end up sliding their brake
lever<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.470> more

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
lever out this way so that it's more

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
lever out this way so that it's more
natural<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.880> their<00:01:39.060> hand<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.689> end<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
natural to have their hand on the end of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.140 
natural to have their hand on the end of
the<00:01:39.930> bar<00:01:40.110> pull<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> middle<00:01:41.369> finger<00:01:41.400> or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the bar pull with the middle finger or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.859 
the bar pull with the middle finger or
two<00:01:42.270> fingers<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.229> that's<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.460> preference

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
two fingers but that's not my preference

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.590 
two fingers but that's not my preference
so<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.110> find<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> angle<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:48.390> feels

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so I'm going to find the angle it feels

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.350 
so I'm going to find the angle it feels
good<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.530> feels<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.210> going

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
good this feels pretty good so I'm going
