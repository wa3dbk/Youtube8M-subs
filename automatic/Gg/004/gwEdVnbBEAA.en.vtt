00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.550
 ingredients 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.620

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.730

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.160
 Second network 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.650

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.720

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.400
 and rib or also that is chest and in 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.050
 this case they also give us 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
 huesitos to give it flavor to me 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.829
 like to buy a part that was called 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.190
 villa that is not that they are not 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.769
 to dry then here is a kilo and a half of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.050
 beef for cooked the amount that 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.269
 you like corn for example 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.489
 These came out very small I take it 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.759
 this part of here they separate it in two 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.560
 then they would be this in halves too 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.110
 we need what is being step 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.710
 I bought a peso but more or less 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.450
 occupies like half that they are 50 cents 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.680
 here I also have what is coco not 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.440
 I know what is similar to the tuna 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.280
 what is this is this the game reads us 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.250
 Now I teach you how to peel but 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.990
 I wanted to overtake then also 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.750
 we need what they are being 2 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.560
 garlic cloves 1 is this for chili and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.930
 another is for the flesh a piece of my the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.480
 half a half onion for the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.080
 chili and half for the meat and what 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.620
 100 grams of bell pepper chili 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.660
 wide or chile guajillo that does not sting and 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.230
 The first thing we are going to do is put the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:58.480
 meat in the express pot for 30 minutes 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.700
 as soon as the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.070
 valve is as soon as we start counting 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.260
 the 30 minutes 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.510
 if you do it not because 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.990
 normal the truth if it takes a little bit 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.040
 more in being his flesh more or less a 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.770
 23 hours then let's start 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.770
 put the meat here and I put the meat in 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.150
 the express pot pressure cooker and you 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.580
 I put half of what is the onion and 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.400
 the clove of garlic and also it is the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.440
 time to put salt also but not 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.300
 tell them in all the videos that then 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.760
 I miss the seasoning because it's salt 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.310
 then we put some salt and 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.920
 we wait 30 minutes from when they are 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.840
 in the valve to turn it off if you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.140
 they also like here you can this one 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.239
 empty what is the corn but as I 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.750
 hey it's already a little full I prefer 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.170
 to leave it like that is how it is like I cut and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.570
 hair everything is something I knew 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.340
 we cut from this side of this other 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.760
 side that is the base 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:13.470
 and we started to remove this coming 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.470
 being the husk and we take everything 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.519
 and here is everything since we took it off 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.200
 what we are going to do is a cross because 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.200
 on the inside are the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.450
 on the inside are the 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.890
 seeds then we take them all 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.890
 it's because it has like little stones 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.900
 That's the way it should be and that's the way others are 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.060
 another ingredient that also do not forget 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.030
 tell them is to thicken the caldito 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.340
 we are going to put what is being a 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.150
 little ball of dough but in this case I do not 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.459
 mass found what I'm going to put it 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.220
 like three tortillas I'll wait for you 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.989
 I'm going with the meat stew 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.920
 to soak them I'm going to leave them well 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.470
 to soak and preferably because I 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.569
 I will put to grind with Chile 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.329
 that thickens a little and is not so 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.579
 watery immediately we put the meat what 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.440
 what we are going to do is in a fret put 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:26.169
 water and we wait for the chiles to boil 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.910
 and those of sven and already remove the veins 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:33.770
 and I already rinse them 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.990
 and we are going to empty them into the water 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.800
 and it's already starting to boil if you give 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.830
 We tell us we are not going to let 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.830
 boil 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.129
 I do not let them take me I was not 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.999
 less than easy 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.999
 be like this 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:01.120
 with a spoon or fork 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.840
 you lower us and you are assange us 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.880
 will occupy the same dish cover and 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.479
 wait for it to be more or less 15 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.330
 minutes 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.820
 the next is the guarantor and it's the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.370
 moment to tell you what is the 30 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.410
 minutes 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.330
 Now what we are going to do is already 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.620
 the chilies and we are going to put them to liquefy 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.720
 together with the garlic and the onion here already 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.140
 I put to liquefy what were the chilies 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.720
 and right here I put the tortillas 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.640
 omelets for expressing the caldito 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.480
 So what we are going to do is in a 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.420
 in a saucepan we are going to put a little 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.090
 oil and we're going to empty the chili here 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.820
 You've already put him crazy in 2 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.000
 tablespoons of oil was where I put him 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.000
 the 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.979
 chile we are going to put what is this 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.979
 epazote 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.830
 and also what is known here is what 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.380
 I know we do not put 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.050
 and what we are going to do is cover him up 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.540
 to help him boil and that he 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.210
 caldito in what is the meat to the 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.300
