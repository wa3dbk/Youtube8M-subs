that you know you're not going to see
anything<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.250> some<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.520> from

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
anything like this for some time from

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.260 
anything like this for some time from
here<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.829> I've<00:01:31.829> done<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> history<00:01:33.180> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
here on out I've done the history on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.920 
here on out I've done the history on
this<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:35.310> eight<00:01:35.520> Blood<00:01:35.820> Moon<00:01:36.030> tetrax<00:01:36.540> since

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
this the eight Blood Moon tetrax since

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710 
this the eight Blood Moon tetrax since
the<00:01:37.079> time<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> Christ<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:38.720> everything

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the time of Christ in everything

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
the time of Christ in everything
surrounding<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.350> shua<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.579> time<00:01:41.820> there

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
surrounding a shua in that time there

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.670 
surrounding a shua in that time there
was<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.860> tetra<00:01:43.909> specifically<00:01:44.909> right<00:01:45.299> then

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
was not a tetra specifically right then

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
was not a tetra specifically right then
but<00:01:46.680> since<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:48.270> very<00:01:48.840> interesting

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
but since then and it's very interesting

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.990 
but since then and it's very interesting
when<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> look<00:01:49.799> through<00:01:50.130> history<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.670> speaks

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
when you look through history it speaks

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.499 
when you look through history it speaks
for<00:01:51.240> itself<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:52.520> every<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:55.909> these<00:01:56.909> tetrax

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
for itself it's every time these tetrax

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.410 
for itself it's every time these tetrax
come<00:01:57.689> around<00:01:57.930> big<00:01:58.290> events<00:01:58.820> big<00:01:59.820> events<00:02:00.240> are

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
come around big events big events are

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
come around big events big events are
surrounding<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.079> either<00:02:01.590> before<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
surrounding it either before in the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.749 
surrounding it either before in the
middle<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.790> after<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.079> see<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> lot<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.759> big

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
middle or after you can see a lot of big

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.960 
middle or after you can see a lot of big
events<00:02:05.909> happening<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> end<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
events happening at the end here and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
then kind of shifted gears and now we're

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.450 
then kind of shifted gears and now we're
here<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.150> one

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
in September of 2017 now everybody's got

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.110 
in September of 2017 now everybody's got
the<00:04:50.500> theory<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:51.040> timeline<00:04:51.460> out<00:04:51.670> there<00:04:51.910> and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
the theory of a timeline out there and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.800 
the theory of a timeline out there and
to<00:04:52.360> me<00:04:52.540> specifically<00:04:53.200> I'm<00:04:53.500> not<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:53.860> sure<00:04:53.890> if

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
to me specifically I'm not so sure if

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190 
to me specifically I'm not so sure if
these<00:04:55.810> events<00:04:56.290> are<00:04:56.910> marked<00:04:57.910> by<00:04:58.120> one<00:04:58.660> day<00:04:58.930> and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
these events are marked by one day and

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.410 
these events are marked by one day and
time<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.770> think<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.130> may<00:05:00.280> be<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.490> broader<00:05:00.880> window

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
time I think it may be a broader window

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.390 
time I think it may be a broader window
and<00:05:01.660> these<00:05:01.750> tetrads<00:05:02.290> very<00:05:02.860> well<00:05:03.160> may

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
and these tetrads very well may

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.780 
and these tetrads very well may
represent<00:05:03.730> that<00:05:04.770> but<00:05:05.770> along<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.310> way<00:05:06.340> here

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
represent that but along the way here

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.480 
represent that but along the way here
after<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:07.330> tetra<00:05:07.780> we<00:05:07.990> see<00:05:08.230> this<00:05:08.410> sign<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.400> the

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490
