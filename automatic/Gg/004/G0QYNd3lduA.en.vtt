00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
now you delete the that one on the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.730 
now you delete the that one on the
bottom<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.790> sides<00:01:09.060> put<00:01:09.869> two<00:01:10.080> main<00:01:10.260> cannons

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

on<00:01:10.860> each<00:01:11.040> side<00:01:12.439> like<00:01:13.439> so

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.740 

ok

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.460 

and<00:01:24.870> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.580> put<00:01:27.510> a<00:01:27.690> dumpster<00:01:28.230> like

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and on the top you put a dumpster like

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.260 
and on the top you put a dumpster like
this<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:31.250> have<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> wall<00:01:32.580> leaning<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:35.270> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this I have a wall leaning on it this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
this I have a wall leaning on it this
helps<00:01:36.870> how<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.440> shoot<00:01:37.830> out<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.820> have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
helps how you shoot out you don't have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
helps how you shoot out you don't have
to<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.510> but<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.710> easier

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to do this but I think it's easier

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.350 
to do this but I think it's easier
because<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.369> shoots<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:42.020> all<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.080> now

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
because it shoots you out all right now

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.250 
because it shoots you out all right now
look<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.840> does<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.690> need<00:01:49.080> a

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
look see it does not go so you need a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.000 
look see it does not go so you need a
regenerator<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.920> throw<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.890> i'll

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
regenerator and you throw it up and i'll

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.940 
regenerator and you throw it up and i'll
throw<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> top<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.950> that's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
throw you at the top like that that's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
throw you at the top like that that's
how<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.310> didn't<00:01:59.520> work<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.700> everyone<00:02:00.000> shut<00:02:00.330> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
how it didn't work for everyone shut it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
how it didn't work for everyone shut it
again<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.500> how<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.800> works<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> that's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
again so that's how it works and that's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.870 
again so that's how it works and that's
that<00:02:08.479> okay

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.530 

see<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.570> bye
