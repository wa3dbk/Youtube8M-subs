design elements to it the other material

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.499 
design elements to it the other material
that<00:01:52.219> you<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.609> called<00:01:52.789> D<00:01:53.029> stone

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
that you see is called D stone

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.569 
that you see is called D stone
it's<00:01:53.779> a<00:01:53.929> woven<00:01:54.350> textile<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:54.979> has<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.099> really

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
it's a woven textile that has a really

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.370 
it's a woven textile that has a really
high<00:01:55.849> abrasion<00:01:56.299> resistant<00:01:56.719> rating<00:01:56.959> but<00:01:57.259> it

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
high abrasion resistant rating but it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.050 
high abrasion resistant rating but it
also<00:01:57.529> has<00:01:57.829> flecks<00:01:58.159> in<00:01:58.249> it<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:58.549> it's<00:01:58.700> as<00:01:58.849> a

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
also has flecks in it so it's as a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.359 
also has flecks in it so it's as a
slight<00:01:59.450> stretch<00:01:59.779> a<00:01:59.959> slight<00:02:00.289> flex<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.859> it<00:02:01.249> has

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
slight stretch a slight flex and it has

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.709 
slight stretch a slight flex and it has
a<00:02:01.399> high<00:02:01.670> abrasion<00:02:02.149> resistant<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:02.599> that's

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
a high abrasion resistant and that's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.149 
a high abrasion resistant and that's
gonna<00:02:02.810> be<00:02:02.959> that<00:02:03.020> woven<00:02:03.259> d<00:02:03.560> stone<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:03.950> see
