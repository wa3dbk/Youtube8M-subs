00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.000 
this is a series where we'll focus more
on<00:00:06.450> how<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.899> be<00:00:07.109> better<00:00:07.140> at<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.649> actual

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
on how to be better at the actual

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160 
on how to be better at the actual
mechanics<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> game<00:00:09.030> versus<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.960> quick

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
mechanics of the game versus just quick

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.839 
mechanics of the game versus just quick
tips<00:00:10.440> here<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.769> there<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.370> today<00:00:11.610> we're<00:00:11.790> gonna

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
tips here and there so today we're gonna

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.430 
tips here and there so today we're gonna
be<00:00:12.059> talking<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.900> movement<00:00:13.380> mechanics

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
be talking about the movement mechanics

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.460 
be talking about the movement mechanics
of<00:00:13.889> your<00:00:13.920> pilot<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.759> titanfall<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> couple

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
of your pilot in titanfall so a couple

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.689 
of your pilot in titanfall so a couple
of<00:00:16.590> things<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.920> should<00:00:17.130> know<00:00:17.279> right<00:00:17.460> off<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
of things you should know right off the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.880 
of things you should know right off the
bat<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.510> not<00:00:18.660> Call<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> Duty<00:00:19.439> you're<00:00:19.740> not

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
bat this is not Call of Duty you're not

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.470 
bat this is not Call of Duty you're not
restricted<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:20.910> kind<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.210> running

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
restricted to just kind of running

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.660 
restricted to just kind of running
around<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.170> halo<00:00:22.680> jumps<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.310> things<00:00:23.490> like

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
around and in halo jumps and things like

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.759 
around and in halo jumps and things like
that<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.689> whole<00:00:24.869> different<00:00:25.320> game<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that this is a whole different game and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.320 
that this is a whole different game and
so<00:00:26.099> you've<00:00:26.220> probably<00:00:26.369> seen<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> lot<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
so you've probably seen a lot about the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
so you've probably seen a lot about the
parkour<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.590> different<00:00:28.859> things<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.099> can

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
parkour and the different things you can

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.700 
parkour and the different things you can
do<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.090> we'll<00:00:30.630> kind<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> discuss<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
do and we'll kind of discuss that and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290 
do and we'll kind of discuss that and
how<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.640> affect<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.000> gameplay

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
how this really can affect your gameplay

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.139 
how this really can affect your gameplay
make<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> better<00:00:33.899> overall<00:00:34.290> player<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
make you a better overall player so the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.190 
make you a better overall player so the
first<00:00:36.390> thing<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.690> need<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:37.079> about

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
first thing you need to know about

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
first thing you need to know about
titanfall<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.760> there's<00:00:38.940> one

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
titanfall and really if there's one

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880 
titanfall and really if there's one
thing<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> take<00:00:39.480> away<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.079> video<00:00:40.500> over

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
thing you take away from this video over

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799 
thing you take away from this video over
anything<00:00:41.489> else<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> said<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> game

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
anything else that said this is a game

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
anything else that said this is a game
of<00:00:43.050> movement<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> move<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
of movement and the way you move and the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
of movement and the way you move and the
way<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> navigate<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.260> map<00:00:46.410> matters<00:00:46.860> more

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
way you navigate the map matters more

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.500 
way you navigate the map matters more
than<00:00:47.250> almost<00:00:47.399> anything<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> game

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
than almost anything you do in the game

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.959 
than almost anything you do in the game
anybody<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.649> run<00:00:49.800> around<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.430> fire<00:00:50.760> their

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
anybody can run around and fire their

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
anybody can run around and fire their
weapon<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.480> kill<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> couple<00:00:51.870> pilots<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.620> some

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
weapon and kill a couple pilots or some

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
weapon and kill a couple pilots or some
grunts<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.280> things<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> way

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
grunts or things like that but the way

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510 
grunts or things like that but the way
you<00:00:54.809> choose<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> move<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> way<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> choose

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you choose to move in the way you choose

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
you choose to move in the way you choose
to<00:00:56.730> navigate<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> map<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:58.230> help<00:00:58.620> set<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
to navigate the map really help set you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.319 
to navigate the map really help set you
apart<00:00:59.219> from<00:00:59.280> being<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> good<00:00:59.820> player<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
apart from being a good player to a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
apart from being a good player to a
great<00:01:00.629> player<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.590> before<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.010> talk<00:01:02.190> about

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
great player now before we talk about

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
great player now before we talk about
any<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> actual<00:01:03.210> movement<00:01:03.480> mechanics<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
any of the actual movement mechanics I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.560 
any of the actual movement mechanics I
want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> point<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.150> that's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
want to point out one thing and that's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
want to point out one thing and that's
controller<00:01:07.170> layout<00:01:07.500> usually<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> isn't

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
controller layout usually this isn't

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.070 
controller layout usually this isn't
that<00:01:08.970> big<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> deal<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.630> games<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that big of a deal in games it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.300 
that big of a deal in games it's
something<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.830> afterthought

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
something that's kind of an afterthought

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.969 
something that's kind of an afterthought
but<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.939> titanfall<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.689> absolutely<00:01:13.200> suggest<00:01:13.590> if

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but in titanfall I absolutely suggest if

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.990 
but in titanfall I absolutely suggest if
you're<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.460> playing<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.909> game

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you're going to be playing this game

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.140 
you're going to be playing this game
with<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> controller<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.530> Xbox<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.369> Xbox

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
with a controller on Xbox one or Xbox

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170 
with a controller on Xbox one or Xbox
360<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:18.960> even<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.229> PC<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.340> use<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> following

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
360 or even on PC that use the following

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.929 
360 or even on PC that use the following
layout<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.080> called<00:01:22.380> bumper<00:01:22.740> jumper<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
layout it's called bumper jumper now the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
layout it's called bumper jumper now the
main<00:01:24.180> reason<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.509> suggest<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.200> typically

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
main reason I suggest this is typically

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800 
main reason I suggest this is typically
your<00:01:26.369> button<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> jump<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
your button to jump it's going to be the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.539 
your button to jump it's going to be the
a<00:01:27.840> button<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> controller<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.220> means

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
a button on the controller that means

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.770 
a button on the controller that means
you're<00:01:29.640> gonna<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.329> thumb<00:01:30.540> off

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you're gonna have to take your thumb off

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.010 
you're gonna have to take your thumb off
the<00:01:31.020> stick<00:01:31.290> press<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.220> maybe<00:01:32.729> twice<00:01:33.119> maybe<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the stick press a maybe twice maybe a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
the stick press a maybe twice maybe a
few<00:01:34.229> times<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.710> sequence<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:36.119> not

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
few times in a sequence and it's not

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.910 
few times in a sequence and it's not
really<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> beneficial<00:01:37.229> unless<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> have

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
really that beneficial unless you have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
really that beneficial unless you have
like<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.100> scuf<00:01:38.430> controller<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.479> don't

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
like a scuf controller which I don't

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.090 
like a scuf controller which I don't
know<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.110> probably<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> probably<00:01:40.950> don't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
know you probably do you probably don't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
know you probably do you probably don't
who<00:01:41.250> knows<00:01:41.280> there's<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.150> large<00:01:42.390> group

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
who knows there's a pretty large group

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.870 
who knows there's a pretty large group
for<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> bumper<00:01:43.979> jumper<00:01:44.159> layout<00:01:44.640> as

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
for that but the bumper jumper layout as

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
for that but the bumper jumper layout as
I'm<00:01:45.119> gonna<00:01:45.240> put<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> screen<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.170> uses

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I'm gonna put on the screen here uses

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
I'm gonna put on the screen here uses
the<00:01:46.740> left<00:01:47.100> bumper<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.640> jump<00:01:47.970> versus<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the left bumper to jump versus that a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.289 
the left bumper to jump versus that a
button<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.680> honestly<00:01:50.369> guys<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> tell<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
button and honestly guys when I tell you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.420 
button and honestly guys when I tell you
that<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> easiest<00:01:52.470> most<00:01:52.799> efficient

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that this is the easiest most efficient

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
that this is the easiest most efficient
way<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.119> mean<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.020> feels

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
way to do it I mean it it feels

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
way to do it I mean it it feels
perfectly<00:01:56.250> natural<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> controller<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
perfectly natural with the controller to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
perfectly natural with the controller to
use<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.079> versus<00:01:58.530> say<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.430> throwing<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
use this versus say like throwing a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
use this versus say like throwing a
grenade<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.479> something<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.079> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
grenade or something like that I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
grenade or something like that I
honestly<00:02:02.340> wouldn't<00:02:02.790> wouldn't<00:02:03.450> use<00:02:03.540> any<00:02:03.780> other

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
honestly wouldn't wouldn't use any other

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
honestly wouldn't wouldn't use any other
button<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.469> unless<00:02:04.649> again<00:02:05.040> unless<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
button for this unless again unless you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
button for this unless again unless you
have<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> scuff<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.149> even<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.350> like

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
have a scuff but even then I just like

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.960 
have a scuff but even then I just like
the<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> feels<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> play<00:02:08.580> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the way this feels when you play so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 
the way this feels when you play so
definitely<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.869> suggest<00:02:10.200> trying<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.619> out

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
definitely I suggest trying that out

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.290 
definitely I suggest trying that out
first

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
first

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.020 
first
so<00:02:12.020> let's<00:02:12.170> get<00:02:12.290> into<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> mechanics<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.460> first

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
so let's get into the mechanics so first

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.970 
so let's get into the mechanics so first
thing<00:02:14.570> you'll<00:02:14.750> probably<00:02:14.780> realize<00:02:15.290> as<00:02:15.710> soon<00:02:15.890> as

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
thing you'll probably realize as soon as

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.210 
thing you'll probably realize as soon as
you<00:02:16.070> get<00:02:16.190> into<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.490> game<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.570> double<00:02:17.870> jump

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
you get into the game is the double jump

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.650 
you get into the game is the double jump
it's<00:02:19.220> pretty<00:02:19.490> simple<00:02:19.850> all<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.210> need<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.570> is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it's pretty simple all you need to do is

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's pretty simple all you need to do is
press<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.990> pajama<00:02:21.290> button<00:02:21.530> twice<00:02:21.650> obviously

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
press the pajama button twice obviously

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.050 
press the pajama button twice obviously
your<00:02:22.520> best<00:02:22.730> bet<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.900> go<00:02:24.140> ahead<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
your best bet on this is to go ahead and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.760 
your best bet on this is to go ahead and
jump<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.420> second<00:02:26.780> time<00:02:26.960> at<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> highest

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
jump the second time at the highest

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.080 
jump the second time at the highest
point<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.280> your<00:02:28.370> first<00:02:28.610> jump<00:02:28.820> you're<00:02:29.030> gonna

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
point of your first jump you're gonna

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.640 
point of your first jump you're gonna
get<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.360> most<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.960> like<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.380> just

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
get the most out of it like that just

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.070 
get the most out of it like that just
like<00:02:31.070> any<00:02:31.250> video<00:02:31.550> game<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.450> second<00:02:32.900> biggest

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
like any video game the second biggest

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.020 
like any video game the second biggest
mechanic<00:02:33.620> you're<00:02:33.740> gonna<00:02:33.860> utilize<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.670> wall

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
mechanic you're gonna utilize is wall

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.120 
mechanic you're gonna utilize is wall
running<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:36.020> wall<00:02:36.290> running<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.680> important

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
running now wall running is important

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.770 
running now wall running is important
for<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> couple<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.640> reasons<00:02:37.820> number<00:02:38.330> one<00:02:38.480> you

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
for a couple of reasons number one you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.450 
for a couple of reasons number one you
gain<00:02:39.050> momentum<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.800> way<00:02:40.010> meaning<00:02:40.340> you

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
gain momentum that way meaning you

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.160 
gain momentum that way meaning you
actually<00:02:40.820> run<00:02:41.000> faster<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> wall<00:02:41.900> than<00:02:42.080> you

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
actually run faster on the wall than you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.440 
actually run faster on the wall than you
do<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> ground<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.130> number<00:02:43.730> two<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.270> can

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
do on the ground and number two you can

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.690 
do on the ground and number two you can
actually<00:02:44.560> extend<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.740> length<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.280> your<00:02:46.400> jump

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
actually extend the length of your jump

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.670 
actually extend the length of your jump
meaning<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.150> can<00:02:47.270> jump<00:02:47.570> further<00:02:47.870> because<00:02:48.500> you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
meaning you can jump further because you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920 
meaning you can jump further because you
have<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.250> additional<00:02:49.730> momentum<00:02:50.240> so<00:02:50.720> wall

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
have that additional momentum so wall

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.870 
have that additional momentum so wall
running<00:02:51.110> itself<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.650> very<00:02:51.920> easy<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.430> do<00:02:52.610> all

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
running itself is very easy to do all

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.580 
running itself is very easy to do all
you<00:02:52.910> need<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.240> do<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.600> sprinting<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.470> need

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
you need to do is be sprinting you need

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.320 
you need to do is be sprinting you need
to<00:02:54.710> jump<00:02:54.950> towards<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.490> wall<00:02:55.640> at<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> 45

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
to jump towards a wall at like a 45

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.990 
to jump towards a wall at like a 45
degree<00:02:56.810> angle<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:58.340> contextual<00:02:58.730> based

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
degree angle and it's contextual based

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.340 
degree angle and it's contextual based
so<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.240> gonna<00:02:59.330> automatically<00:02:59.900> pick<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.320> up

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
so it's gonna automatically pick you up

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.100 
so it's gonna automatically pick you up
and<00:03:00.680> start<00:03:01.250> moving<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.670> along<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.120> wall<00:03:02.300> so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
and start moving you along the wall so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.660 
and start moving you along the wall so
these<00:03:03.350> mechanics<00:03:03.860> really<00:03:04.010> are<00:03:04.250> pretty<00:03:04.490> useful

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
these mechanics really are pretty useful

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.490 
these mechanics really are pretty useful
in<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> lot<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.300> different<00:03:05.690> situations<00:03:06.320> in

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
in a lot of different situations in

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.310 
in a lot of different situations in
titanfall<00:03:07.060> some<00:03:08.060> buildings<00:03:08.420> for<00:03:08.600> example<00:03:09.080> are

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
titanfall some buildings for example are

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.260 
titanfall some buildings for example are
spaced<00:03:09.620> apart<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.130> where<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.370> can't<00:03:10.700> double

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
spaced apart to where you can't double

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.150 
spaced apart to where you can't double
jump<00:03:11.480> across<00:03:11.720> them<00:03:12.080> but<00:03:12.650> if<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:12.890> get<00:03:13.040> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
jump across them but if you get the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.980 
jump across them but if you get the
ability<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.550> wall<00:03:13.820> run<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.270> then<00:03:14.450> double<00:03:14.750> jump

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
ability to wall run and then double jump

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.900 
ability to wall run and then double jump
you<00:03:15.140> can<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.980> I'll<00:03:16.310> try<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:16.550> show<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.760> guys<00:03:16.820> a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
you can and I'll try and show you guys a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.699 
you can and I'll try and show you guys a
good<00:03:17.090> example<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.020> really<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
good example of that and really just the

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.170 
good example of that and really just the
speed<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.160> which<00:03:19.310> you're<00:03:19.459> gonna<00:03:19.580> move<00:03:19.820> across

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
speed in which you're gonna move across

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.449 
speed in which you're gonna move across
the<00:03:20.360> map<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.870> point<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.620> much<00:03:22.190> faster

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
the map at that point is so much faster

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.070 
the map at that point is so much faster
than<00:03:22.850> you're<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.120> sprinting<00:03:23.540> across<00:03:23.870> the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
than you're just sprinting across the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.990 
than you're just sprinting across the
ground<00:03:24.320> now<00:03:24.920> granted<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> do<00:03:25.580> have<00:03:25.820> unlimited

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
ground now granted you do have unlimited

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.470 
ground now granted you do have unlimited
sprint<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:27.170> if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.500> take<00:03:28.000> seven<00:03:29.000> seconds<00:03:29.450> to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
sprint but if you take seven seconds to

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.510 
sprint but if you take seven seconds to
sprint<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.050> same<00:03:30.290> gap<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.860> can<00:03:31.040> double

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
sprint the same gap that you can double

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.720 
sprint the same gap that you can double
jump<00:03:31.550> wall<00:03:31.970> run<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.920> two<00:03:33.920> seconds<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.580> mean

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
jump wall run in two seconds I mean

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.520 
jump wall run in two seconds I mean
you're<00:03:34.820> saving<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> lot<00:03:35.300> of<00:03:35.360> time<00:03:35.510> there<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.080> so

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
you're saving a lot of time there and so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.170 
you're saving a lot of time there and so
that's<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.770> big<00:03:36.980> part<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.459> as<00:03:37.700> well

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
that's a big part of that as well

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.140 
that's a big part of that as well
so<00:03:38.480> these<00:03:38.690> mechanics<00:03:39.200> really<00:03:39.500> are<00:03:39.680> gonna<00:03:39.830> be

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
so these mechanics really are gonna be

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.820 
so these mechanics really are gonna be
pretty<00:03:41.150> core<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> way<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.020> play<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.650> game

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
pretty core in the way you play the game

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.680 
pretty core in the way you play the game
if<00:03:43.070> you're<00:03:43.550> not<00:03:43.700> doing<00:03:44.209> these<00:03:44.390> in

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
if you're not doing these in

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.350 
if you're not doing these in
opportunities<00:03:45.590> where<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:45.830> could<00:03:46.280> or<00:03:46.550> can<00:03:47.120> or

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
opportunities where you could or can or

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.760 
opportunities where you could or can or
what<00:03:47.480> get<00:03:47.630> any<00:03:47.750> advantage<00:03:47.990> in<00:03:48.290> doing<00:03:48.590> so

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
what get any advantage in doing so

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.400 
what get any advantage in doing so
you're<00:03:49.340> not<00:03:49.490> playing<00:03:49.850> titanfall<00:03:50.300> right<00:03:50.810> I've

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
you're not playing titanfall right I've

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380 
you're not playing titanfall right I've
seen<00:03:51.650> lots<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:52.100> bigger<00:03:52.400> youtubers<00:03:53.120> post

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
seen lots of bigger youtubers post

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.580 
seen lots of bigger youtubers post
videos<00:03:53.750> where<00:03:53.900> they're<00:03:54.020> just<00:03:54.170> running<00:03:54.380> around

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
videos where they're just running around

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.080 
videos where they're just running around
the<00:03:54.800> whole<00:03:54.920> time<00:03:54.980> like<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.550> Call<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.790> Duty

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
the whole time like it's Call of Duty

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.520 
the whole time like it's Call of Duty
and<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:56.780> not<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.140> way<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.290> should<00:03:57.500> be

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
and that's not the way you should be

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.990 
and that's not the way you should be
playing<00:03:57.770> this<00:03:57.950> game<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.430> shouldn't<00:03:58.640> approach

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
playing this game you shouldn't approach

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.850 
playing this game you shouldn't approach
it<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.480> same<00:03:59.690> thing<00:03:59.990> because<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:00.770> not

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
it like the same thing because it's not

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.270 
it like the same thing because it's not
wall<00:04:01.760> running<00:04:02.090> jumping<00:04:02.830> sprinting<00:04:03.830> double

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
your best friends in this game now let's

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.670 
your best friends in this game now let's
talk<00:04:08.030> about<00:04:08.180> some<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.600> uses<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:09.080> this<00:04:09.230> not

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
talk about some of the uses in this not

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.290 
talk about some of the uses in this not
only<00:04:09.830> is<00:04:10.070> map<00:04:10.250> navigation<00:04:10.489> going<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.180> the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
only is map navigation going to be the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.880 
only is map navigation going to be the
biggest<00:04:11.480> part<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.930> how<00:04:12.080> this<00:04:12.260> plays<00:04:12.530> into<00:04:12.860> what

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
biggest part of how this plays into what

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.040 
biggest part of how this plays into what
you<00:04:13.100> do<00:04:13.310> but<00:04:13.970> there's<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.180> couple<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.630> key

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
you do but there's a couple of key

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.510 
you do but there's a couple of key
situations<00:04:15.709> where<00:04:15.890> this<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.190> going<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.400> give

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
situations where this is going to give

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.970 
situations where this is going to give
you<00:04:16.609> specific<00:04:17.150> advantage<00:04:17.660> number<00:04:18.350> one<00:04:18.709> is

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
you specific advantage number one is

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.979 
you specific advantage number one is
rodeoing<00:04:19.729> titans<00:04:20.090> that's<00:04:20.359> where<00:04:20.540> you<00:04:20.600> jump<00:04:20.870> on

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
rodeoing titans that's where you jump on

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.210 
rodeoing titans that's where you jump on
the<00:04:21.109> Titan<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.590> open<00:04:21.830> up<00:04:21.890> their<00:04:22.070> little

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
the Titan you open up their little

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.740 
the Titan you open up their little
backplate<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.270> shoot<00:04:23.450> them<00:04:23.630> in

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
backplate and you just shoot them in

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.499 
backplate and you just shoot them in
their<00:04:23.870> core

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
their core

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.960

hi<00:04:25.080> that's<00:04:25.919> really<00:04:26.250> my<00:04:26.400> preferred<00:04:26.580> way<00:04:26.940> to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
hi that's really my preferred way to

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.749 
hi that's really my preferred way to
take<00:04:27.270> down<00:04:27.300> Titans<00:04:27.870> it's<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:28.710> much<00:04:28.949> fun<00:04:29.250> but

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
take down Titans it's so much fun but

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.040 
take down Titans it's so much fun but
you're<00:04:29.910> not<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.030> gonna<00:04:30.389> get<00:04:30.599> there<00:04:30.780> every

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
you're not just gonna get there every

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.439 
you're not just gonna get there every
single<00:04:31.229> time<00:04:31.380> by<00:04:31.800> luck<00:04:32.069> or<00:04:32.280> by<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:33.060> jumping

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
single time by luck or by just jumping

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.270 
single time by luck or by just jumping
around<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.020> hoping<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.349> land<00:04:34.590> on<00:04:34.740> them<00:04:34.919> you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
around and hoping you land on them you

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.800 
around and hoping you land on them you
need<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.490> plan<00:04:35.699> things<00:04:35.940> out<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:36.599> if<00:04:36.690> you

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
need to plan things out and so if you

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.930 
need to plan things out and so if you
can<00:04:36.960> wall<00:04:37.169> run<00:04:37.470> over<00:04:38.039> to<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> double<00:04:38.639> jump<00:04:38.789> and

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
can wall run over to a double jump and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.820 
can wall run over to a double jump and
you<00:04:39.060> can<00:04:39.210> land<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.569> back<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.930> Titan<00:04:40.289> that's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
you can land on the back of Titan that's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.469 
you can land on the back of Titan that's
perfect<00:04:41.370> or<00:04:41.490> if<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:41.639> see<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.880> Titan<00:04:42.240> coming

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
perfect or if you see a Titan coming

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.969 
perfect or if you see a Titan coming
your<00:04:42.599> way<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.319> want<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.500> double<00:04:43.650> jump

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
your way you just want to double jump

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.820 
your way you just want to double jump
off<00:04:44.099> wherever<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.580> are<00:04:44.660> again<00:04:45.690> perfect<00:04:46.289> so

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
off wherever you are again perfect so

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.080 
off wherever you are again perfect so
that's<00:04:47.009> one<00:04:47.310> situation<00:04:47.789> where<00:04:47.849> it<00:04:47.970> really

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that's one situation where it really

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.589 
that's one situation where it really
helps

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
helps

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.779 
helps
now<00:04:48.990> there's<00:04:49.199> another<00:04:49.289> mechanic<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.610> wall

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
now there's another mechanic to the wall

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.270 
now there's another mechanic to the wall
run<00:04:51.090> that's<00:04:51.660> very<00:04:52.229> limited<00:04:52.710> use<00:04:52.919> in<00:04:53.099> my

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
run that's very limited use in my

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.129 
run that's very limited use in my
opinion<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.910> that's<00:04:54.000> called<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.479> wall<00:04:54.750> hang

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
opinion and that's called the wall hang

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.110 
opinion and that's called the wall hang
now<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.889> stops<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.310> dead<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.699> your<00:04:56.729> tracks

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
now this stops you dead in your tracks

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.300 
now this stops you dead in your tracks
if<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:57.539> hold<00:04:57.810> down<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.169> 80s<00:04:58.680> trigger<00:04:59.099> the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
if you hold down the 80s trigger the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.939 
if you hold down the 80s trigger the
left<00:04:59.550> trigger<00:04:59.759> as<00:05:00.060> your<00:05:00.690> wall<00:05:00.900> running<00:05:01.319> so<00:05:01.710> you

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
left trigger as your wall running so you

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.339 
left trigger as your wall running so you
just<00:05:02.130> literally<00:05:02.550> hang<00:05:02.789> there<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.870> benefit<00:05:04.229> is

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
just literally hang there the benefit is

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.839 
just literally hang there the benefit is
you<00:05:04.380> can<00:05:04.710> stop<00:05:04.949> what<00:05:05.130> you're<00:05:05.250> doing<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.699> you

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
you can stop what you're doing and you

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.580 
you can stop what you're doing and you
can<00:05:06.000> shoot<00:05:06.300> at<00:05:06.449> people<00:05:06.780> but<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.080> can't<00:05:07.380> aim

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
can shoot at people but you can't aim

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.559 
can shoot at people but you can't aim
down<00:05:07.800> sights<00:05:08.130> because<00:05:08.400> you're<00:05:08.940> hanging<00:05:09.360> off

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
down sights because you're hanging off

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.020 
down sights because you're hanging off
the<00:05:09.720> wall<00:05:09.870> with<00:05:10.050> one<00:05:10.080> arm<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.460> really<00:05:11.789> is

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the wall with one arm so it really is

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.760 
the wall with one arm so it really is
very<00:05:12.599> limited<00:05:13.050> use<00:05:13.229> there<00:05:13.440> are<00:05:13.470> definitely

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
very limited use there are definitely

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.080 
very limited use there are definitely
situations<00:05:14.310> where<00:05:14.460> I<00:05:14.520> can<00:05:14.669> see<00:05:14.789> where<00:05:14.909> it'd<00:05:15.000> be

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
situations where I can see where it'd be

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.909 
situations where I can see where it'd be
helpful<00:05:15.539> or<00:05:15.630> it<00:05:15.960> can<00:05:16.110> help<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.560> in<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.710> tactical

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
helpful or it can help you in a tactical

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.219 
helpful or it can help you in a tactical
situation<00:05:17.789> but<00:05:18.479> it's<00:05:18.630> not<00:05:18.780> something<00:05:19.110> you

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
situation but it's not something you

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.930 
situation but it's not something you
should<00:05:19.259> be<00:05:19.409> trying<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.830> do<00:05:20.009> constantly<00:05:20.669> unless

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
should be trying to do constantly unless

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.159 
should be trying to do constantly unless
you're<00:05:21.120> trying<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.330> do<00:05:21.479> like<00:05:21.659> a<00:05:21.690> funny<00:05:21.990> video

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
you're trying to do like a funny video

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.960 
you're trying to do like a funny video
or<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.560> challenge<00:05:23.039> or<00:05:23.190> something<00:05:23.400> like<00:05:23.639> that

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
or a challenge or something like that

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.670 
or a challenge or something like that
I'm<00:05:24.419> just<00:05:24.870> keep<00:05:25.020> in<00:05:25.110> mind<00:05:25.229> you<00:05:25.289> have<00:05:25.319> that

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
I'm just keep in mind you have that

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.860 
I'm just keep in mind you have that
ability<00:05:25.860> but<00:05:26.370> it's<00:05:26.520> not<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:27.210> greatest<00:05:27.479> thing

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
ability but it's not the greatest thing

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.480 
ability but it's not the greatest thing
to<00:05:28.110> do<00:05:28.229> it<00:05:28.380> stops<00:05:28.650> your<00:05:28.860> momentum<00:05:29.099> and<00:05:29.430> it

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
to do it stops your momentum and it

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.920 
to do it stops your momentum and it
stops<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:29.880> from<00:05:29.909> doing<00:05:30.090> what<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:30.539> were<00:05:30.659> doing

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
stops you from doing what you were doing

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.629 
stops you from doing what you were doing
and<00:05:31.169> it's<00:05:31.560> not<00:05:31.710> permanent<00:05:31.949> either<00:05:32.310> at<00:05:32.490> some

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
and it's not permanent either at some

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.120 
and it's not permanent either at some
point<00:05:32.849> you<00:05:32.940> do<00:05:33.060> fall<00:05:33.300> off<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.690> wall<00:05:33.840> so<00:05:34.139> the

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
point you do fall off the wall so the

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.950 
point you do fall off the wall so the
final<00:05:35.520> thought<00:05:35.759> for<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.210> with<00:05:36.570> these

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
final thought for you with these

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.290 
final thought for you with these
movement<00:05:37.560> momentum<00:05:38.070> kind<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.610> techniques<00:05:39.030> is

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
movement momentum kind of techniques is

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.360 
movement momentum kind of techniques is
to<00:05:39.930> make<00:05:40.080> sure<00:05:40.110> that<00:05:40.259> you're<00:05:40.590> using<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:41.099> to

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
to make sure that you're using this to

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.339 
to make sure that you're using this to
your<00:05:41.520> advantage<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:42.539> one<00:05:42.750> thing<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.199> don't

your advantage the one thing you don't

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.439 
your advantage the one thing you don't
want<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.680> do<00:05:43.800> is<00:05:43.949> just<00:05:44.130> run<00:05:44.340> around<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:45.090> jump
