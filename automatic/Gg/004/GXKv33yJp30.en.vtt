00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
compatible one has got to be a lie and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.770 
compatible one has got to be a lie and
the<00:03:10.489> other<00:03:10.670> one's<00:03:10.880> got<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.450> truth

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780
