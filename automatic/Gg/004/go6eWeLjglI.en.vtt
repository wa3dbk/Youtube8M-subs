00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.420
 hello how about friends vaccinated adriano bar 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.730
 I made this video especially so that 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.629
 you realize how you can manipulate 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.270
 your phone from superuser is to say 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.250
 the root for it I already have installed 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.250
 previously what is ay to write 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.250
 Android 4.0 sandwich 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.220
 and for that 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.230
 I can show it at this time as 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.740
 we realize we're going to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 bring the phone closer 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:42.640
 Once here you will already show us the version 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.640
 android 4.0 point 3 perfect 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 according to the routing once it comes out 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.910
 the superuser application that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.220
 we have up here 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.540
 we enter and for the first time you get a 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.180
 sign in which you have to accept 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.180
 tells us the version number that is 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.040
 is already installed and in this case 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 You still see this list in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.110
 white and some applications appear 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.480
 since they are the ones that I have handled and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.340
 they need these special permits 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.890
 so here he shows you the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.930
 records if allowed or created 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.310
 canceled at times so it is no longer 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.369
 you need to use 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.710
 and for this if you install this 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.909
 application that is battery calibration 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.979
 without being rooted from the team then you 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.539
 will send errors that can not be 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.060
 run applications in a way 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.039
 adequate and therefore unlock the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 application you do it first you have to 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.149
 root for you to open the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.549
 application and you can manipulate it 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.420
 I do it right now with my application 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.479
 that I use to record in this case is 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.850
 exactly the same then you 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.590
 You can continue to give an account before you 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.009
 Run some application that asks you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.950
 Routing is going to ask you if you want to give 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.630
 permission you just want to give him permissions and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.429
 from here from the list you can go 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.190
 manipulating your applications like you 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.350
 want 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.200
 well I hope that it has helped you from 'the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.200
