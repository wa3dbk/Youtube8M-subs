Kuwait is the active you know is it a
pregnant<00:00:55.530> dog<00:00:55.739> there's<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.820> many<00:00:56.940> different

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
pregnant dog there's so many different

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
pregnant dog there's so many different
factors<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> mean<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> could

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
factors you know I mean that could

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
factors you know I mean that could
affect<00:00:59.070> exactly<00:00:59.730> what<00:01:00.059> easy<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:00.870> dog<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
affect exactly what easy to your dog and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
affect exactly what easy to your dog and
how<00:01:01.469> much<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> content<00:01:03.090> network<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
how much well the content network is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.660 
how much well the content network is
very<00:01:03.989> similar<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> basically

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
very similar to that and so basically

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.950 
very similar to that and so basically
your<00:01:08.670> click-through<00:01:09.060> rates<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.840> your

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
your click-through rates and your

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
your click-through rates and your
expectation<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> probably<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> depend

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
expectation is probably going to depend

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.179 
expectation is probably going to depend
on<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> number<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> factors<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.590> might<00:01:14.040> depend

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
on a number of factors it might depend

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.780 
on a number of factors it might depend
on<00:01:15.619> what<00:01:16.619> types<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.009> sites<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.549> you're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
on what types of sites that you're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
on what types of sites that you're
targeting<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> targeting<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:19.049> general

specific sites very very targeted for
your<00:01:29.909> audience<00:01:30.320> um<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.369> um<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
your audience um you know it's um it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.289 
your audience um you know it's um it
could<00:01:33.780> depend<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.549> strategy<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.909> you're

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
could depend on your strategy if you're

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.749 
could depend on your strategy if you're
doing<00:01:36.689> placement<00:01:37.290> targeting<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.070> display<00:01:38.490> at

doing placement targeting and display at

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
doing placement targeting and display at
it<00:01:39.450> maybe<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> expectation<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.650> your

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it maybe the expectation for your

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.960 
it maybe the expectation for your
click-through<00:01:41.040> rates<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.790> much

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
click-through rates going to be much

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.719 
click-through rates going to be much
higher<00:01:42.210> than<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:43.290> you're<00:01:43.409> doing<00:01:43.649> text<00:01:44.130> ads<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
higher than if you're doing text ads and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.880 
higher than if you're doing text ads and
you're<00:01:44.939> being<00:01:45.119> shown<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.290> myspace

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you're being shown on you know myspace

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
you're being shown on you know myspace
or<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> New<00:01:48.720> York<00:01:48.869> Times<00:01:48.899> or

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.690 
or and you know the New York Times or
something<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.799> where<00:01:50.100> there's<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
something like that where there's just a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
something like that where there's just a
lot<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> traffic<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> lot<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
lot of a lot of traffic and a lot of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.300 
lot of a lot of traffic and a lot of
general<00:01:53.479> conversations<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.799> um

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
general conversations going on so um

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.899 
general conversations going on so um
basically<00:01:57.119> there's<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.619> answer<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.159> what

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
basically there's not an answer on what

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
basically there's not an answer on what
is<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.329> expectation<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:01.350> what's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.860> good

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
is the expectation for what's a good
