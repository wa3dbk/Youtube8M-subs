00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.370
 the gospel in three minutes with mario 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.860
 persona as we have already learned prayer 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.650
 should start with expressions 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 aims at exaltation and gratitude to God for 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.529
 Then talk about our 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.420
 needs 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 it is also necessary to remember the character 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 prayer pantry taught by 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 Jesus 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 it was given at a time when the church 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.220
 there was still no holy spirit 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 I was with the disciples but not 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.880
 dwelt in them the gospel of John Jesus 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.570
 says the spirit of truth lives with you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.960
 and will be in the future in you 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 joÃ£o chapters is 14 25 17 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 these things would only happen on the day of 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.850
 Pentecost in chapter 12 acts from 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.289
 hence everyone who is saved by jesus 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.960
 enjoys the presence of the holy spirit 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.750
 inhabiting them individually and in the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 church equipment as jesus 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.460
 was in the world the holy spirit to act 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.309
 on the disciples from the outside in 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.520
 today the consoling holy spirit acts in the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.170
 within believer out should hence 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 difference between prayer that jesus 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.030
 taught the disciples and that the Christian 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 today have the privilege of putting on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.439
 practice 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.990
 paulo writes romans 8 26 the spirit 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.240
 helps us in our weakness because we do not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.119
 we know how to live but the very 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 Spirit intercedes for us with moans 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.310
 and the one who probes the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.860
 hearts know intention of spirit 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 because the spirit intercedes for the saints 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.890
 according to the will of God is in 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 Romans 8 at 6 to 27 before the descent of the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.369
 Holy Spirit 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.220
 the disciples had not yet 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.290
 this privilege and once again we see 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 there the absurdity of the decorated prayers 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.360
 repeated today the Christian is helped by the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.939
 holy spirit to pray and for more 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.060
 It is important that we intercede 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.909
 for others we should not forget 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.520
 that every believer has the privilege of 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.930
 a direct access to God without 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.700
 intermediates 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.720
 some religions teach their 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.350
 that this access is only possible 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.780
 and some gave him the priest 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.050
 but the crime is clear he 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.560
 knows that since the time of satan no 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.120
 It's just that things in this world work in the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 base of manipulation domination and control 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.590
 Paulo was worried for this not 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.890
 happen to the Corinthians he said 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.930
 my message my preaching does not 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.350
 consisted of persuasive words from 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.030
 human wisdom plus demonstration of 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.970
 power of the spirit so that your faith 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.950
 was not based on human wisdom but 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.959
 the power of God is first and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.440
 corinthians two of four or five and the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.950
 movies we think he wrote so 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.990
 my beloved, as always, you 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.760

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.300

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.590
 the union in action the salvation of you with 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.709
 fear and trembling 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.840
 for in God doeth in you both 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.170

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.450
 You already created in Jesus.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.410
 to the father knowing that he is able to do 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.350
 infinitely more than anything that 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.190
 we ask or think according to your 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.769
