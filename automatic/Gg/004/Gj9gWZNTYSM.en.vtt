00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello and welcome to this video 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.790
 Today I want to give you my wish 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.480
 iphone or too my perfect iphone 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.130
 describe 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.170
 but this is really only about the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.759
 go hardware and I'd say it is 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.070
 nothing really revolutionary here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.960
 it's more about the little things here 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 is really great iphone even better 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.800
 make or perfect it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 really hardly exists in the smartphone sector 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 something else not some handy 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 already possesses or what we at all 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.730
 able to imagine 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.080
 I think in 20 years will be the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 smartphones again functions 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.619
 have those for us today 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.320
 Incidentally, the whole thing is unthinkable 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.670
 here are more animations video for it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 there is still no iphone in it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.950
 images 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.059
 but now I digress a lot 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.059
 fun with this video 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.770
 Let's start with the display 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 I would buy an iphone with 4.7 inches 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.539
 and 1080p really great and imagine 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.199
 that would also be many android users 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.180
 attract 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 but I think more than 5 inches 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 too much and also simply impractical 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 maybe here would be one too 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.039
 Choice between four and 47 inches 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.149
 attached next I wish 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.979
 another material 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 here was often the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 Concept lay with metal inserted and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 I think that's very exciting, too 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.479
 In short, liquid metal is like that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 pretty indestructible and would that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 image and iphone broke quickly 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 finally put an end 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.930
 you would not have any heights 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 use and that would be real for me 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.840
 a great innovation 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.299
 Connected to it says the next 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.040
 Point and water resistance 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.680
 did that show that sony xperia z 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 and it's not so rare that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.520
 water comes to iphone and something is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.229
 simply extremely annoying and currently 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.549
 is an iphone with water damage in the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.860
 apple store not even against money 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.540
 So replaced a waterproof 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 iphone finally personally pretty horny 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.899
 then I want something to run and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.909
 say to the internal memory 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.950
 at the working storage agile is ideal 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.840
 if you could decide it yourself 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.720
 could a power user maybe up to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.790
 4 gb and a normal user one to two 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.880
 choose gigabyte ram and then I would 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.200
 another iphone model with 128 gigabytes 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.509
 very welcome to internal memory 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.520
 and here's my memory 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.990
 something that annoys me for so long 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.670
 many of you become that canon 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.649
 sometimes you just want a pdf 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.149
 file or anything else on that 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.470
 move it and as it were 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.270
 use usb-stick 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 and that's where the problem is 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.360
 I would not be so easy 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.310
 wish that there is a possibility 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200
 for example, somehow a data app 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.240
 or so the iphone quickly calculator 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 connect and in less than one 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.020
 minute to have the file on the iphone 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.490
 but I think that will be mine 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.900
 stay wishful thinking and I have to 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.820
 continue to send mail yourself 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.160
 that 's it with this video, too 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.190
 think you have noticed that my wish 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 iphone so a bit in the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.610
 individualization is not like that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.410
 motto iks from the outside but more so from 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.230
 the hardware that you ram and the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.060
 memory anyway so the display size so 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.650
 can put together a little himself 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.530
 Write me in the comments how 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.140
 your dream iphone would be or if you are with 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.760
 Me otherwise agrees otherwise 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.760
 thanks for watching and ciao
