00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello friends today we will make the lights 

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:07.979
 strobes that carry the cars of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.549
 the police to make the circuit let's 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.610
 to need a circuit diagram a 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.100
 boa proto plate 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.529
 all the components that go to the pole 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.289
 positive we will connect it to the holes 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.810
 of the red line and the negatives to the 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.869
 holes in the blue line too 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.430
 we will need two transistors 12 m 22 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.300
 22 to 2 resistances of 22 kilos and 2 of 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.059
 one kilo a 9 volt battery two 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.200
 2.2 micro fra ' capacitors 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:46.390
 16 volts two LEDs one red and 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.390
 the other blue color and cables 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.410
 we will place the transistors with the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.540
 numbers looking towards us is good 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.540
 clarify that the left leg of 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.480
 transistor is the emitter the central leg 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.700
 is the base and the left band the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.910
 manifold 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.650
 we put the transistor in a point 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.140
 I repeat that the transistor numbers 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.330
 it has to see us 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.330
 also the other transistor at a point 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.810
 now we place the resistance of 22 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.290
 boxes one of the legs we connect it to the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.400
 positive pole and the work to the base or leg 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.400
 central transistor 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.510
 we do the same with the other resistance 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.010
 of 22 k we connect it to the positive pole and 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.010
 to the base of the other transistor 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.219
 we put the resistance of one each 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.780
 from the legs to the positive pole and the other 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.780
 will go to the positive leg of the led 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.640
 for the moment we place it towards a 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.710
 point now we put the led the leg 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.259
 positive we connect it to the resistance 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.860
 and the negative leg to the collector's 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.860
 transistor 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.910
 and we do the same in this part 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.910
 we put the resistance of a kart 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:33.099
 and then the led the negative of the gives the 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.099
 collector and the positive to the resistance 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.600
 now we place the 2.2 capacitor 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.910
 micro stopped the negative leg of the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.550
 condenser we connect it to the base of the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.080
 transistor and the positive leg to 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.080
 collector of the other transistor 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.739
 we help ourselves with a cable to 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.739
 connect it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.660
 now with the other capacitor the leg 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.880
 negative to the base 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.480
 and the positive leg to the collector of the other 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.480
 transistor 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.090
 we also help each other with a cable 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.590
 now at the emitter of transistor 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.959
 we will connect to the negative pole 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.959
 we use a cable to connect it 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.830
 and we do the same with the issuer of 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.040
 another transistor we connect to the pole 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.040
 negative 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.840
 We can put this circuit together 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.330
 very homemade way that is soldering the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.810
 legs of each component as indicated in 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.140
 the diagram 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.020
 now we try it connect a cable to 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.569
 positive pole and another cable to the pole 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.750
 negative we connect the negative of the 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.010
 battery to the negative circuit and the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.010
 positive to positive 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.199
 Excellent 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.880
 Here I have it armed 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.310
 as we see it 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.620
 and so that we stay like the lights of 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.729
 the police are going to need a plywood 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.550
 or something similar 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.650
 one half of plastic we cut it from the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.139
 Plastic bottles 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.590
 we use a rule to be able to bend 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.590
 the mica 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.720
 We do as shown in the video 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.850
 and we unite it by applying a bit of 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.850
 hot silicone 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.040
 we cover with two small micas the two 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.500
 holes that are at the ends 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.500
 now we make the holes for the leds 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.389
 use the soldering iron to make the 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.389
 holes 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.150
 and I apply silicone to leave them fixed 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.679
 now to test connect the battery 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.659
 now it's ready to mount it in a 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.659
 stroller that we have at home 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.060
 good friends up here with the video yes 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.849
 He liked video and served them give him a 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:27.180
 click on I like ' subscribe to the channel and 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:30.349
 share the video thanks to everyone and 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.349
 until the next video
