00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 friends as they are today I will not give a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.379
 barbie report I will give an answer to a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.049
 series of questions that have come to me 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.150
 through the Internet mail of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.770
 facebook twitter and first then 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.110
 thank you very much for being following this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.710
 this series of videos the question 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.279
 concrete is why or when I go to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.160
 talk about campaign policy or 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 candidates the answer is I'm not going to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.079
 talk about candidates or campaigns and if 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.920
 I talk about politics I talk a lot about 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.310
 policy is very important to me that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 let's understand and that I can communicate the 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.030
 concept that I have of politics 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.540
 international because of politics 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.880
 international because I believe a lot in that 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.670
 maximum hermetic that says that as is 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.800
 up is down this means that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 as things happen up they happen 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.880
 also down to the extent that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.610
 We understand how they are handling 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.590
 threads from above globally we go 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.600
 to understand how the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.270
 threads also in our in our 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.939
 countries or in our Latin America ' 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.909
 true for the globalization america 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.340
 latina is still a compendium of 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.340
 Poor guys throwing a lot of desire for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.250
 They say that Brazil is a country 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.869
 emergent is coming out and the others 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 we remain united in our 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 mediocrities and in our poverty in 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.630
 our miseries them how they see us 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.890
 look 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.310
 the electoral process for me is dirty is 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.670
 corrupt is false and unnecessary is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.549
 hypocrite because this is the process 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.000
 electoral let me make an analogy like that 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.200
 with cereals 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 the tiger toño and his caritas melvin and his 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.870
 crashed krispis and the corn cock 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.970
 flakes them good the tiger good 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.370
 you know, vote for him because he's strong 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.310
 because he is athletic for what you want 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.340
 because it is sugary and what we need 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.580
 it's sugar and the town with the sugar 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.430
 Acquire energy and fight no no no I warned 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.070
 melvin the little elephant vote for me I'm from 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.350
 chocolate chocolate is from america and 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.880
 America needs the strength of chocolate 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.590
 etcetera etcetera 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.950
 good the cock the cock says no me 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.920
 mine I am austere I do not need 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.830
 sugar or chocolate to convince you 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.910
 tests nor see the street well ok 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.500
 third blablabla market tns 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.020
 honestly I'll tell you something or the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.170
 tiger toño is the owner of zucaritas 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.480
 nor melvin is the owner of the choco 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.310
 krispis nor the cock of conflicts 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.300
 the mind are the image 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.120
 the real owner is that the crazy 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.980
 and Kellogg's sell their products to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.760
 through then let's say one that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.100
 it also comes to be something like part 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.770
 of this globalization and this 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.900
 movement of I take your wool 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:18.900
 I explode that I use yes when you 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.300
 they could say but but caravan in 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.660
 net movements like the biggest or there 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.450
 is Mexican of the Fernandez family 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.550
 are my uncles unfortunately this of the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.890
 fernandez family el mais oro mira no 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.630
 there is only one extraordinary story of 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.360
 success leave more gold chaplain this leaves 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.850
 more gold and it starts to grow and starts to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.830
 compete with the little elephant and with the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.600
 tigrito and with the cock and starts to 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.240
 hit them and start to catch up 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.670
 never exceeded it may just really to 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.310
 them but if it was level even 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.280
 he saw that against marketing he could not 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.260
 and appealed to the nationalism of the Mexicans 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.549
 my soros the fernandez family don arturo 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.959
 come the consumption and they lowered the price 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.739
 they lowered it to the price of the serial 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.569
 clearly Mexican and cost 15 per 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.329
 one hundred percent cheaper in the market without 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.700
 However, after 2000, the 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.680
 debacle they begin to absorb and it reaches 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.380
 the table and he tells some he knows that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 don oscar i bought him the 24th 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.270
 percent of the shares then only 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.860
 to finally support the terms 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.930
 from 2003 2004 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.380
 gamesa is the owner of maison and who is 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.750
 gamesa is pepsico again we go 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.280
 out again you see the money again 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.610
 they use us again they take out the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.780
 little money they pay us and I know 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.000
 they take that is all this moral then 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.830
 so are the political parties 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.660
 candidates are not the owners the faces 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.150
 that we see are not really the ones that 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.030
 we believe there are some owners behind them 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.889
 and if those owners call themselves kellogg's 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.039
 if they are called mezcles and they are called 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.139
 cocacola if they are called pepsico obey 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.449
 the world movements that's why I 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.160
 talk about international politics so 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.530
 I'm interested to inform us 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.360
 well all together how is the cop 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.760
 how are the threads of the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.040
 international politics that yes I 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.320
 interesting because in Mexico and throughout 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.030
 latin america and the third world 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.810
 campaigns and candidates are equally 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.910
 useless are dirty are corrupt are 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.300
 rotten they do not really serve they are not going to 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.890

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.810

 participation in honest movements and 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.050
 true we managed to make those 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.480
 people who drive to the third world and 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.650
