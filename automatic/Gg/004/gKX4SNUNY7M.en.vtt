00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 we decided to check the quality of the gasoline and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.819
 the amount of gasoline developed by 3 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.300
 main gas stations kandalakshe 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.450
 this is a statoil with vega and no roses 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.000
 we will fill 92 gasoline to take 2 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 liter on each refueling emerge here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.210
 in this bank so go first refueling 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.210
 with vega 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.740
 choose exactly 2 liters of gasoline 92 gasoline 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 so we poured 2 liters of gasoline day 2 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 on for svega now we measure 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.410
 92 is it or not 92 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.980
 we have an octane indicator 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.900
 motor gasoline special 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.250
 octane meter 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.250
 and so we make peace 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.840
 93 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.469
 that is, it turns out that the octane number 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.000
 gasoline 92 gasoline us from the century it is even 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.399
 not 92 93 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.170
 by the way the error is allowed one and a half 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.820
 units that is it is possible for one and a half units 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.950
 one or two more units 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.520
 less here one more than that is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.700
 the urge to swag offers 92 gasoline satan 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.259
 the number is one more than 92 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.259
 at least this is how our device shows 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.909
 the next refueling Rosneft is also here 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.149
 buys 92 petrol and pour 2 liters in 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.149
 jar 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.690
 level exactly 2 liters per vega barely 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.250
 Does the guitar on the rise of oil is one and the same 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.910
 the amount of gas here is that level 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.910
 matches 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.990
 Now we take our miracle device 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.270
 octane indicator for gasoline 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.270
 check 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.180
 we are already scolded asking what 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.349
 the grounds we are shooting 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.349
 based on curiosity 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.280
 eg 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.819
 specialized store 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 us 3 refueling today statoil fill 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.280
 also 2 liters and here on the counter 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.340
 well, almost too . 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:14.200
 a little less than two here one liter 190 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.200
 gram where is our device 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.230
 octane car gasoline 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.680
 and using this device we measure 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.920
 octane gasoline 92 at the gas station 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.190
 statoil in a kandalaksha now exhibit 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.190
 0 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.930
 88 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.700
 8 Article 8, we did not pursue the goal of making 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.770
 advertising or vice versa 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.990
 anti-advertising one or another filling station 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.940
 stations we just wanted to show what 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.120
 gasoline 92 today offer on the plant 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.120
 you decide
