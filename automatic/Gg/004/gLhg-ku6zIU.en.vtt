00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.630 

my<00:00:31.540> design<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.349> really<00:00:33.310> wanted<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.520> put

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.340 
the logo on the top just of san jose i
always<00:00:36.280> think<00:00:36.400> that's<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.930> bit<00:00:37.930> of<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.080> clean

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
always think that's a bit of a clean

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.770 
always think that's a bit of a clean
look<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.890> classic<00:00:39.670> like<00:00:39.820> most<00:00:40.090> guys<00:00:40.300> used<00:00:40.690> to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
look and classic like most guys used to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.290 
look and classic like most guys used to
have<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.080> on<00:00:41.200> top<00:00:41.410> on<00:00:42.309> top<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.760> starts<00:00:43.059> with<00:00:43.150> the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
have it on top on top it starts with the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.740 
have it on top on top it starts with the
water<00:00:43.559> i<00:00:44.640> think<00:00:45.640> i've<00:00:45.850> really<00:00:46.300> liked<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.510> top

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
water i think i've really liked the top

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.310 
water i think i've really liked the top
like<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.260> just<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:47.739> way<00:00:47.860> he<00:00:48.010> did<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.340> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
like the just the way he did it and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.369 
like the just the way he did it and
asked<00:00:50.320> him<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.470> fade<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.489> as<00:00:51.970> it's<00:00:52.930> like<00:00:53.199> the

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
asked him to fade it as it's like the

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.880 
asked him to fade it as it's like the
ocean<00:00:53.739> gets<00:00:53.890> darker<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:56.440> came<00:00:56.559> up<00:00:56.620> with

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
ocean gets darker and we came up with

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.600 
ocean gets darker and we came up with
the<00:00:56.980> idea<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:58.080> putting<00:00:59.080> a<00:00:59.230> couple<00:00:59.610> girls

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
girls and things like that so it turned

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.050 
girls and things like that so it turned

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
came up with a pretty cool idea I did a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.100 
came up with a pretty cool idea I did a
few<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.130> junior<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.630> threw<00:01:55.630> around<00:01:55.720> ideas

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
few in junior just threw around ideas

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.050 
few in junior just threw around ideas
but<00:01:56.649> now<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:56.860> had<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:58.619> david's<00:01:59.619> email<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.819> we

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
but now I had a david's email and we

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.660 
but now I had a david's email and we
must<00:02:01.330> have<00:02:01.539> sent<00:02:01.750> about<00:02:01.990> 10<00:02:02.890> or<00:02:03.009> 15<00:02:03.160> e-mails

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
must have sent about 10 or 15 e-mails

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.540 
must have sent about 10 or 15 e-mails
back<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:03.970> forth<00:02:04.179> with<00:02:04.569> different<00:02:04.929> ideas<00:02:05.020> and

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
back and forth with different ideas and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.520 
back and forth with different ideas and
it's<00:02:06.550> pretty<00:02:06.759> hard<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.349> things

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
it's pretty hard to think of things

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.680 
it's pretty hard to think of things
because<00:02:09.090> every<00:02:10.090> day<00:02:10.270> I'll<00:02:10.420> think<00:02:10.599> is

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
because every day I'll think is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.000 
because every day I'll think is
something<00:02:10.989> different<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.470> want<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.709> throw<00:02:11.890> it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
something different and want to throw it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.309 
something different and want to throw it
in<00:02:12.099> there<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:12.520> eventually<00:02:12.849> he<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.780> just

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
in there so eventually he just I just

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.170 
in there so eventually he just I just
told<00:02:14.620> him<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.130> because<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:15.790> coming

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
told him to do it because I was coming

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.520 
told him to do it because I was coming
up<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.360> way<00:02:16.510> too<00:02:16.569> many<00:02:16.810> idea

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.920
