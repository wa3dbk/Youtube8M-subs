post and once again it is like I said

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480 
post and once again it is like I said
would<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.810> go<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.560> make<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:41.100> nil

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and this is actually a pretty effective

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500

way to score from corners since I feel

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.510 
way to score from corners since I feel
that<00:02:45.690> corners<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.770> pretty<00:02:46.980> hard<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> score

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
that corners are a pretty hard to score

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.340 
that corners are a pretty hard to score
this<00:02:47.670> year<00:02:47.880> especially<00:02:48.120> compared<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> fifa<00:02:49.140> 14

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
this year especially compared to fifa 14

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.830 
this year especially compared to fifa 14
and<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.310> feel<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.760> whenever<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.630> pass

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
and I feel that whenever you just pass

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.110 
and I feel that whenever you just pass
it<00:02:52.020> short<00:02:52.320> 22<00:02:53.010> York<00:02:53.190> teammate<00:02:53.520> basically<00:02:53.970> you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
it short 22 York teammate basically you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.520 
it short 22 York teammate basically you
only<00:02:54.270> need<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.570> hold<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.020> think<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.320> left

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
only need to hold I think the left

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.620 
only need to hold I think the left
trigger<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:56.040> order<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.610> basically<00:02:57.090> call<00:02:57.540> them

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
trigger in order to basically call them

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.449 
trigger in order to basically call them
up<00:02:57.780> then<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.500> far<00:02:58.709> more<00:02:58.860> effective<00:02:59.280> just

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
up then it is far more effective just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.949 
up then it is far more effective just
doing<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.000> way<00:03:00.030> that's<00:03:00.360> what<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> feel<00:03:00.780> any

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
doing it that way that's what I feel any

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.810 
doing it that way that's what I feel any
way<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.709> also<00:03:01.860> use<00:03:02.010> instructions

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
way you can also use instructions

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.520 
way you can also use instructions
haven't<00:03:03.180> used<00:03:03.330> them<00:03:03.510> yet<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:04.170> year<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> think

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
haven't used them yet this year I think

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.100 
haven't used them yet this year I think
or<00:03:04.950> not<00:03:05.130> not<00:03:05.430> as<00:03:05.550> much<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.330> I'll<00:03:06.750> probably<00:03:06.870> I

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
or not not as much but I'll probably I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.720 
or not not as much but I'll probably I
probably<00:03:07.170> give<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> go<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> future<00:03:08.400> as

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
probably give that a go in the future as

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.000 
probably give that a go in the future as
well<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.060> anyway<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.630> 90th<00:03:10.020> minute<00:03:10.110> into

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010

definitely<00:03:58.980> should<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.220> saved<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.610> one

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
definitely should have saved that one

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.030 
definitely should have saved that one
and<00:04:00.060> kind<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.110> looked<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.440> pass<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.920> me

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
and kind of looked like a pass to me

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.500 
and kind of looked like a pass to me
instead<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.489> just<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.820> normal<00:04:03.000> shot<00:04:03.360> because

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
instead of just a normal shot because

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.090 
instead of just a normal shot because
the<00:04:03.720> power<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.230> wasn't<00:04:04.560> really<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.920> best

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
the power on it wasn't really the best

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.580 
the power on it wasn't really the best
but<00:04:05.310> anyway<00:04:05.600> 25th<00:04:06.600> minute<00:04:06.750> looking<00:04:07.290> at<00:04:07.380> Fir

pretty much gave us delete and as you

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.500 
pretty much gave us delete and as you
can<00:04:26.160> see<00:04:26.190> from<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.669> halftime<00:04:27.030> stats

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
can see from the halftime stats

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.630 
can see from the halftime stats
it<00:04:27.930> actually<00:04:28.110> set<00:04:28.500> up<00:04:28.530> my<00:04:28.770> opponent<00:04:29.280> zero

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
it actually set up my opponent zero

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.670

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.800 
shots on target and also Sarah shots in
total<00:04:32.040> so<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.580> guess<00:04:32.970> I'm<00:04:33.180> right<00:04:33.420> when<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:33.780> said

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
total so I guess I'm right when I said

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.870 
total so I guess I'm right when I said
that<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.590> looked<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.280> looked<00:04:35.640> like<00:04:35.820> a

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
that it looked like it looked like a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.910 
that it looked like it looked like a
pass<00:04:36.450> rather<00:04:36.810> than<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.020> shot<00:04:37.290> but<00:04:37.470> anyway<00:04:37.740> we

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
pass rather than a shot but anyway we

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.430 
pass rather than a shot but anyway we
make<00:04:38.130> it<00:04:38.280> 3-1<00:04:38.700> with<00:04:38.850> masuku<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.510> was<00:04:39.990> kind<00:04:40.290> of

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.160 
being a pass across goal with luck I
said<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.210> basically<00:05:15.240> how<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.900> game

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
said so that is basically how the game

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.110 
said so that is basically how the game
on<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.440> as<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.620> can<00:05:16.800> see<00:05:16.980> from<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.370> stats<00:05:17.610> we

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
on it as you can see from the stats we

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.640 
on it as you can see from the stats we
were<00:05:18.240> absolutely<00:05:18.360> dominating<00:05:19.260> me<00:05:19.380> at<00:05:19.470> eight

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
were absolutely dominating me at eight

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.440 
were absolutely dominating me at eight
shots<00:05:19.980> on<00:05:20.130> target<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.610> my<00:05:20.730> opponent<00:05:21.150> only<00:05:21.360> at

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
shots on target and my opponent only at

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.360 
shots on target and my opponent only at
one<00:05:21.660> in<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.810> variance<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:22.500> yeah<00:05:22.920> we<00:05:23.040> move<00:05:23.250> on

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
one in the variance so yeah we move on

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.860 
one in the variance so yeah we move on
to<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.610> scalars<00:05:23.910> up<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.240> as<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.750> can<00:05:24.840> see

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
to the scalars up and as you can see

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.630 
to the scalars up and as you can see
right<00:05:25.050> there<00:05:25.380> we<00:05:25.530> currently<00:05:25.800> got<00:05:26.010> three<00:05:26.370> goals

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
right there we currently got three goals

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.790 
right there we currently got three goals
with<00:05:26.910> Masuku<00:05:27.480> which<00:05:27.630> is<00:05:27.780> pretty<00:05:27.960> decent<00:05:28.500> we

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
with Masuku which is pretty decent we

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.290 
with Masuku which is pretty decent we
only<00:05:28.950> need<00:05:29.190> two<00:05:29.370> more<00:05:29.400> goals<00:05:29.790> with<00:05:30.000> him<00:05:30.120> in
