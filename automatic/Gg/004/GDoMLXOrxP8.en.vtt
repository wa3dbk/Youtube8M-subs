00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.140
 the kfc is back on times this taste of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 cooking with a new recipe that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.280
 twister I had a little game on 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 facebook will not be I make taste of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.179
 cooking and I'm going to do the dedication to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.010
 the first person who had found the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.750
 name of the recipe so it's a gh 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.550
 engen here I hope I coach pat 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.170
 o'may a little dedication to you and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 now I wish you all a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.289
 very good viewing you will need the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.900
 tomato salad with pepper 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 briefcase of the kris peeters and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.059
 cakes v the first step must 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.190
 to be doing the kris peeters so 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.730
 for that you just have to click on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.040
 trim 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 and then you will automatically 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.059
 redirected to an old video where I 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 explains how to do them of course 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 for the most eager of you not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 need to do it you can buy some 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.340
 in the trade but hey I can you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.140
 to say that they will not be as good as 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.309
 this and then if you do not tend 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.489
 of the fans and do them all 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.620
 simply nature you will start the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 second for that it's very simple you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 go take 4 tablespoons of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.900
 mayonnaise and add pepper and you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.549
 mix well for the amount of 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.470
 pepper I really advise you to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 taste as you go 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 the points are a little different 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.970
 in order to have the best taste possible 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 you will then prepare the filling 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 so we go h and salad and cut 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.259
 slices of tomatoes 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.780
 you will then heat up the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.880
 arm for about 15 seconds at 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.460
 microwaves and once see him and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.960
 hot, we'll go to dressage for 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 that's very simple you'll put 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.439
 a good teaspoon of mayonnaise 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.060
 that you are going to spread it on the wrap 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.930
 we then add the salad we have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 previously prepared have completed 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.549
 with small pieces of tomatoes and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 we finish by adding the piece of 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.009
 chicken and you just have to roll your 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.160
 wraps and we'll be able to move on to 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.390
 tasting the friends it's gone for the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 tasting 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.709
 nice little arm so the twister home 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.020
 kfc 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.060
 I do not know how to put it everywhere 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.060
 it is rather practical to eat and I 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.160
 you say good appetite that's where 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.500
 frankly friends is the return of the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.660
 kfc is the return of mass killings 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.120
 because frankly it's just 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.430
 delicious it's too good so do it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.470
 game urges you to redo the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 recipe at home if you listen to it you 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.630
 also to this pure killing with a very 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.790
 good chicken well scented and spicy it's 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.140
 just delicious and then the wrap 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.489
 it's something I like 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.400
 especially what we can eat 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.290
 quietly in front of the TV so that's it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.820
 even for the big guides who would like 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.720
 to eat in front of their console is 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.370
 possible too 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.739
 then this is not really was not 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.120
