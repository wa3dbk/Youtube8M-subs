so<00:00:10.150> where<00:00:10.540> is<00:00:10.720> HD<00:00:11.110> might<00:00:11.290> be<00:00:11.470> now<00:00:11.740> it's<00:00:12.100> a<00:00:12.220> whole

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
so where is HD might be now it's a whole

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.420 
so where is HD might be now it's a whole
buncha<00:00:12.730> numbers<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.559> can<00:00:14.680> see<00:00:14.860> clock<00:00:15.129> speeds

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
buncha numbers you can see clock speeds

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.790 
buncha numbers you can see clock speeds
in<00:00:15.670> megahertz<00:00:16.180> there's<00:00:16.570> data<00:00:17.170> rates<00:00:17.500> in

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
in megahertz there's data rates in

in megahertz there's data rates in
gigabits<00:00:18.460> per<00:00:18.550> second<00:00:19.029> there's<00:00:19.330> per<00:00:19.630> channel

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960

the streets own officers it all gets

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.029 
the streets own officers it all gets
very<00:00:22.630> confusing<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:25.029> where<00:00:25.300> this<00:00:26.170> is<00:00:26.440> silligan

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
very confusing so where this is silligan

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.370

Hector most capable of the cables have
limitations<00:00:34.980> there's<00:00:35.980> so<00:00:36.550> many<00:00:36.610> different

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
limitations there's so many different

HDMI systems never mind all the claims

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.709 
HDMI systems never mind all the claims
of<00:00:59.440> Peyton<00:00:59.920> bandwidth<00:01:00.399> or<00:01:00.610> what<00:01:01.239> devices<00:01:01.539> are

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
of Peyton bandwidth or what devices are

of Peyton bandwidth or what devices are
capable<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.230> this<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.559> what's<00:01:02.800> actually<00:01:03.070> going

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
capable of this is what's actually going

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.190 
capable of this is what's actually going

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
side-by-side 3d formats and even 1080p

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.539 
side-by-side 3d formats and even 1080p
24<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:51.229> 2d<00:01:52.429> all<00:01:53.429> fit<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.450> bandwidth

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
24 in 2d all fit in that one bandwidth

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
24 in 2d all fit in that one bandwidth
so<00:01:56.549> 1080p<00:01:57.090> 24<00:01:57.239> is<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:57.989> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> golden

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so 1080p 24 is one of the golden

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.010 
so 1080p 24 is one of the golden
standard<00:01:58.679> blu-ray<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.670> now<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.539> fact<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
standard blu-ray right now but fact is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.330 
standard blu-ray right now but fact is
it's<00:02:01.289> actually<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> same<00:02:01.649> thing<00:02:02.039> with<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it's actually the same thing with this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.529 
it's actually the same thing with this
for<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> TI<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.220> sexy<00:02:05.520> body<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.360> that

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
for a TI so a sexy body to get that

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.859 
for a TI so a sexy body to get that
working<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.329> we've<00:02:09.479> been<00:02:09.660> using

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
working the one that we've been using

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.430 
working the one that we've been using
now<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.709> our<00:02:11.280> benchmark<00:02:11.940> as<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:13.019> only

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
now as our benchmark as the only

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
expectation of hdmi to date is the next

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.530 
step up which is 148 15 negative 4.45
you<00:02:21.180> give<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.389> specific<00:02:21.600> that's<00:02:22.350> 1080p<00:02:22.950> 60<00:02:23.540> so

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
you give a specific that's 1080p 60 so

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.870 
you give a specific that's 1080p 60 so
that's<00:02:24.780> that's<00:02:25.139> really<00:02:25.560> been<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.069> Golden

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that's that's really been the Golden

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.430 
that's that's really been the Golden
Nugget<00:02:27.000> today<00:02:27.389> that's<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.079> everybody

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
Nugget today that's what everybody

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.280 
Nugget today that's what everybody
expects<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.040> hdmi<00:02:29.549> so<00:02:30.359> our<00:02:30.540> experience<00:02:31.109> as

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
expects of hdmi so our experience as
