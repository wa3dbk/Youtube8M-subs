hey guys today I'm gonna teach you how

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.019 
hey guys today I'm gonna teach you how
to<00:00:02.399> do<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.580> heelflip<00:00:03.650> so<00:00:04.670> you<00:00:05.670> need<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.910> know

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
to do the heelflip so you need to know

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.570 
to do the heelflip so you need to know
how<00:00:06.150> ollie<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.589> helps<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.919> Newton<00:00:08.160> kickflip

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
how ollie and it helps a Newton kickflip

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.160 
how ollie and it helps a Newton kickflip
by<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.760> don't<00:00:08.940> necessarily<00:00:09.059> need<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.929> learn

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
by you don't necessarily need to learn

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.749 
by you don't necessarily need to learn
that<00:00:10.410> trick<00:00:10.559> because<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.099> know<00:00:11.160> people<00:00:11.429> that

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that trick because I know people that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150 
that trick because I know people that
actually<00:00:12.139> learn<00:00:13.139> heel<00:00:13.380> flips<00:00:13.650> before<00:00:14.070> they

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
actually learn heel flips before they

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340 
actually learn heel flips before they
can<00:00:14.309> kick<00:00:14.490> flip<00:00:14.730> but<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> kickflip<00:00:16.109> just

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
can kick flip but the kickflip just

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.260 
can kick flip but the kickflip just
helps<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.190> understand<00:00:17.699> how<00:00:17.880> what<00:00:18.090> they

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
helps like you understand how what they

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.550 
helps like you understand how what they
what<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> board<00:00:18.750> feels<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.140> when<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.350> floats

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
what the board feels like when it floats

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.580 
what the board feels like when it floats
underneath<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.039> feet<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.199> help<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
underneath your feet so it will help of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.170 
underneath your feet so it will help of
you<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:23.130> them<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:24.720> set<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> heel<00:00:25.830> flip

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
you know them to set up on the heel flip

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.210 
you know them to set up on the heel flip
one<00:00:27.180> put<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.510> front<00:00:27.779> foot<00:00:28.070> pretty<00:00:29.070> much

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
one put your front foot pretty much

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
one put your front foot pretty much
where<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.460> put<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:29.789> an<00:00:29.910> ollie<00:00:30.090> except<00:00:30.990> when

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679

like not down here but like right here
on<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.559> board<00:00:47.719> right<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> tail<00:00:49.079> down

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
on the board right on the tail down

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.750 
on the board right on the tail down
towards<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> corner<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.160> little<00:00:50.219> bit<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.640> up

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
towards the corner a little bit not up

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 
towards the corner a little bit not up
here<00:00:50.940> looking<00:00:51.030> Holly<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that when you talk it'll turn a little

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
that when you talk it'll turn a little
bit<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> way<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:54.989> it'll<00:00:55.410> naturally<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
bit this way so it'll naturally make you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
bit this way so it'll naturally make you
want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> kick<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.390> make<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.539> flip<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
want to kick it to make it flip like a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.470 
want to kick it to make it flip like a
hill<00:00:58.170> foot<00:00:58.820> I'm<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.940> work<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.329> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hill foot I'm gonna work it out like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.189 
hill foot I'm gonna work it out like
that<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> pop<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:02.370> ollie<00:01:03.199> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that so when you pop like an ollie you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.289 
that so when you pop like an ollie you
want<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> take<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.949> front<00:01:05.250> foot<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
right here great parallel with this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.690 
right here great parallel with this
wheel<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.720> out<00:01:18.720> over<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:20.400> too<00:01:20.549> much

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
wheel and out over here not too much

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.760 
wheel and out over here not too much
just<00:01:20.759> try<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.229> want<00:01:22.380> trying<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> do

this is just get your foot from here to
here<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.060> slide<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.720> should<00:01:27.930> work<00:01:28.080> out

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
here and slide and it should work out

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
here and slide and it should work out
just<00:01:28.350> fine<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> whole<00:01:29.250> flip<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:30.390> make

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
just fine with the whole flip just make

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.969 
just fine with the whole flip just make
sure<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.680> flips

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
sure it's out of the way when it flips

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
sure it's out of the way when it flips
because<00:01:32.939> sometimes<00:01:33.299> i<00:01:33.390> bring<00:01:33.540> my<00:01:33.630> front<00:01:33.869> foot

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
because sometimes i bring my front foot

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
because sometimes i bring my front foot
back<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> early<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.979> it'll<00:01:35.430> mess<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
back to early and it'll mess up the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.690 
back to early and it'll mess up the
board<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> everything<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> just

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
board and everything so you want to just

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
board and everything so you want to just
flick<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> keep<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> way<00:01:39.840> keep<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
flick and keep it out of the way keep it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.130 
flick and keep it out of the way keep it
up<00:01:40.979> above<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> board<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
up above the board and then when it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
to make it flip so instead of just

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.619 
to make it flip so instead of just
kicking<00:02:09.470> my<00:02:09.560> leg<00:02:09.800> out<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.789> kicked<00:02:11.450> my

leg and not your whole body and it'll

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.830 
leg and not your whole body and it'll
work<00:02:26.810> out<00:02:26.989> all<00:02:27.050> right<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.739> should<00:02:28.750> nothing<00:02:29.750> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
work out all right it should nothing to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.650 
work out all right it should nothing to
sink<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:31.340> some<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:33.700> having<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> board<00:02:35.060> spin

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
sink is some not having the board spin

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.720 
sink is some not having the board spin
right<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.230> would<00:02:36.410> flick<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.069> then<00:02:37.610> right

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
right like I would flick and then right

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.300 
right like I would flick and then right
before<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:38.060> boards<00:02:38.330> his<00:02:38.390> funnel<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> way<00:02:39.310> my

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
before the boards his funnel the way my

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.370 
before the boards his funnel the way my
foot<00:02:40.610> would<00:02:40.730> always<00:02:40.940> get<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.269> way<00:02:41.450> it

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
foot would always get in the way it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.130 
foot would always get in the way it
wouldn't<00:02:42.590> mess<00:02:42.799> it<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.069> my<00:02:43.250> stall<00:02:43.549> up<00:02:43.760> I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
wouldn't mess it off my stall up I

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.620 
wouldn't mess it off my stall up I
actually<00:02:45.140> send<00:02:45.500> those<00:02:45.590> went<00:02:45.890> up<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.630> flicked

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
actually send those went up and flicked

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.270 
actually send those went up and flicked
and<00:02:47.840> then<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.170> probably<00:02:48.590> foot<00:02:48.920> back<00:02:49.099> in<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and then like probably foot back in to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330 
and then like probably foot back in to
tip<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.549> back<00:02:49.670> over<00:02:49.940> till<00:02:50.090> he<00:02:50.180> was<00:02:50.269> like<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.280> I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
tip the back over till he was like and I

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.220 
tip the back over till he was like and I
almost<00:02:52.519> let<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.849> was<00:02:53.329> really<00:02:53.510> weird<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:53.930> I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
almost let it was really weird but I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.650 
almost let it was really weird but I
almost<00:02:55.220> did<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.519> couple<00:02:55.579> times<00:02:55.819> but<00:02:56.360> what

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
almost did that a couple times but what

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.140 
almost did that a couple times but what
you<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.049> do<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.130> just<00:02:58.280> flick<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.849> hang

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
you want to do is to just flick and hang

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.539 
you want to do is to just flick and hang
it<00:02:59.329> out<00:02:59.510> there<00:02:59.780> long<00:03:00.650> enough<00:03:00.860> for<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.280> board

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
it out there long enough for the board

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.970 
it out there long enough for the board
to<00:03:01.640> level<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.239> underneath<00:03:02.750> your<00:03:03.049> feet<00:03:03.260> and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
to level out underneath your feet and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.490 
to level out underneath your feet and
then<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.220> bring<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.519> up<00:03:04.700> over<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.299> as<00:03:06.170> your

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
then you bring it up over it as your

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.240 
then you bring it up over it as your
back<00:03:06.620> foot<00:03:06.829> catches<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.630> stomp<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.780> down<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
back foot catches it stomp it down and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.930 
back foot catches it stomp it down and
it<00:03:10.250> will<00:03:10.340> work<00:03:10.489> out<00:03:10.639> just<00:03:10.670> fine<00:03:10.970> for<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.389> and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
it will work out just fine for you and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.830 
it will work out just fine for you and
went<00:03:13.940> well<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.900> finished<00:03:15.739> trick<00:03:16.400> will<00:03:16.609> look

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
went well the finished trick will look

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.990 
went well the finished trick will look
look<00:03:17.840> something<00:03:18.109> like<00:03:18.139> this<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:25.000> it's

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
look something like this like that it's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.479 
look something like this like that it's
really<00:03:26.299> not<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.660> hard<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.170> trick<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:28.310> takes

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
really not that hard of a trick it takes

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.620 
really not that hard of a trick it takes
a<00:03:28.579> little<00:03:28.700> bit<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:28.910> time<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.180> get<00:03:29.299> used<00:03:29.510> to

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
a little bit of time to get used to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.110 
a little bit of time to get used to
kicking<00:03:29.930> out<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.730> should<00:03:31.910> get<00:03:32.000> it

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
kicking out but you should get it

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.059 
kicking out but you should get it
eventually<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:33.579> um<00:03:34.579> yeah<00:03:35.829> after<00:03:36.829> learning

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
eventually and um yeah after learning

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.259 
eventually and um yeah after learning
will<00:03:37.280> facing<00:03:37.579> examples<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:40.269> we're

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
will facing examples of it and if we're

00:03:41.269 --> 00:04:09.400 
will facing examples of it and if we're
kind<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.480> right<00:03:41.600> for<00:03:41.810> you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.810 

once<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.530> learn<00:04:10.650> heel<00:04:10.830> flips<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.550> learn

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
once you learn heel flips you can learn

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.310 
once you learn heel flips you can learn
some<00:04:12.000> variations<00:04:12.530> such<00:04:13.530> as<00:04:14.210> faking<00:04:18.110> the<00:04:19.110> half

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
some variations such as faking the half

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.180 
some variations such as faking the half
cat<00:04:19.560> heel<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:23.220> double<00:04:23.790> heel<00:04:23.940> foot
