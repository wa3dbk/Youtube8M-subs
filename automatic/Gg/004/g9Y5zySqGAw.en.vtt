00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.289 
kind of parts or what what they're doing
differently<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.820> looks<00:03:13.120> like<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
differently but it just looks like a

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.910 
differently but it just looks like a
slightly<00:03:13.660> cheaper<00:03:13.989> harmonica

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
slightly cheaper harmonica

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.840 
slightly cheaper harmonica
however<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:17.049> looks<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.920> be<00:03:17.950> deceiving<00:03:18.430> and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
however the looks can be deceiving and

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.650 
however the looks can be deceiving and
it<00:03:19.030> plays<00:03:19.590> relatively<00:03:20.590> well<00:03:20.769> all<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:22.330> the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
it plays relatively well all of the the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.080 
it plays relatively well all of the the
notes<00:03:22.930> are<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.290> tune<00:03:23.890> as<00:03:24.190> they<00:03:24.400> should<00:03:24.459> be<00:03:24.850> and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
notes are in tune as they should be and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.840 
notes are in tune as they should be and
it's<00:03:25.989> made<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.410> Germany<00:03:26.860> so<00:03:27.100> these<00:03:27.370> aren't<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
it's made in Germany so these aren't the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.710 
harmonicas this is a German hand tuned
harmonica<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.459> going<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.760> be<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.209> a

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
harmonica so it's going to be of a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.990 
harmonica so it's going to be of a
certain<00:03:38.500> quality

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
certain quality

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.750

it's not very airtight when you play you

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.680 
it's not very airtight when you play you
want<00:03:50.200> air<00:03:50.680> tightness<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.209> don't

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690

harmonica in contrast is something like

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.570 
harmonica in contrast is something like
a<00:04:14.160> golden<00:04:15.160> melody<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:16.030> special<00:04:16.750> 20<00:04:17.170> or<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.580> sidle

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
airtight and that is one thing that I

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.420 
airtight and that is one thing that I
