this<00:03:23.630> guy's<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> goner<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:27.470> wouldn't<00:03:27.650> kill

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
this guy's a goner but we wouldn't kill

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.120 
this guy's a goner but we wouldn't kill
him<00:03:28.040> off<00:03:28.190> yet<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:29.390> show<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:29.750> started<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.920> he

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.250 

so<00:03:43.850> how<00:03:44.000> did<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.330> Mathemagician<00:03:44.750> avoid

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
so how did the Mathemagician avoid

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.630 
so how did the Mathemagician avoid
becoming<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.770> human<00:03:46.070> paperweight<00:03:48.490> here<00:03:49.490> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
becoming a human paperweight here the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.450 
becoming a human paperweight here the
secrets<00:03:51.310> as<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:54.080> illusion<00:03:54.410> begins<00:03:54.770> the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
secrets as the illusion begins the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.130 
secrets as the illusion begins the
magician<00:03:55.880> is<00:03:55.970> placed<00:03:56.240> into<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.600> restraints

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
magician is placed into the restraints

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.200 
magician is placed into the restraints
to<00:03:57.650> make<00:03:57.800> his<00:03:57.950> escape<00:03:58.070> from<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.520> car<00:03:58.730> appear

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
to make his escape from the car appear

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.580 
to make his escape from the car appear
impossible<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.480> how<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.840> our<00:04:03.020> magician<00:04:03.230> able

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
impossible so how is our magician able

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.660 
impossible so how is our magician able
to<00:04:03.650> break<00:04:03.800> free<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.890> trick<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.370> there

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
to break free the trick is that there

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.190 
to break free the trick is that there
are<00:04:07.790> two<00:04:08.000> pieces<00:04:08.210> of<00:04:08.390> rope<00:04:08.660> tied<00:04:09.020> together

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
are two pieces of rope tied together

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.640 
are two pieces of rope tied together
with<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.560> thin<00:04:09.830> thread<00:04:10.840> making<00:04:11.840> them<00:04:11.960> very<00:04:12.260> easy

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
with a thin thread making them very easy

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.629 
with a thin thread making them very easy
to<00:04:12.920> break<00:04:13.070> apart

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.879 

but<00:04:17.299> how<00:04:17.449> is<00:04:17.629> our<00:04:17.719> mystery<00:04:18.109> man<00:04:18.319> able<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:18.739> get

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
but how is our mystery man able to get

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.700 
but how is our mystery man able to get
out<00:04:19.069> of<00:04:19.219> the<00:04:19.280> car<00:04:19.519> before<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.329> crushed

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.680 

this<00:04:23.580> part<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.000> illusion<00:04:24.300> takes

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
this part of the illusion takes

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.559 
this part of the illusion takes
split-second<00:04:25.620> timing<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.190> some<00:04:26.940> magical
