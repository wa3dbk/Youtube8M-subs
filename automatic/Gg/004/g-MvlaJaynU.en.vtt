00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
cable sometimes you have to have a cable

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
cable sometimes you have to have a cable
with<00:00:59.609> four<00:00:59.820> pins<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.239> each<00:01:00.390> end<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.840> the

with four pins on each end on the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
with four pins on each end on the
connector<00:01:01.469> sometimes<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.280> use<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.640> with

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
connector sometimes you can use one with

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.509 
connector sometimes you can use one with
just<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> depends<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> fax<00:01:04.110> machine

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
just two it depends on the fax machine

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
just two it depends on the fax machine
usually<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.820> doesn't<00:01:06.119> matter<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.780> are

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
usually it doesn't matter but there are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
usually it doesn't matter but there are
a<00:01:06.960> couple<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.320> older<00:01:07.680> ones<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.040> there<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
a couple of older ones out there that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.870 
a couple of older ones out there that
are<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.119> picky<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.580> make<00:01:11.580> sure<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
are that are picky so make sure you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.969 
are that are picky so make sure you
check<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.960> first<00:01:12.990> step<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
check that out the first step is to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
check that out the first step is to
connect<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.460> phone<00:01:14.700> cord<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.020> available

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
connect your phone cord to an available

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.830 
connect your phone cord to an available
phone<00:01:16.680> jack<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.610> we've<00:01:17.970> already<00:01:18.180> done<00:01:18.509> here

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
phone jack which we've already done here

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.080 
phone jack which we've already done here
so<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.439> phone<00:01:19.710> cord<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.100> live<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.759> it's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so this phone cord is live it's it's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
so this phone cord is live it's it's
going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> connection<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> phone

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
going to have a connection to the phone

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.969 
going to have a connection to the phone
line<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> next<00:01:24.210> thing<00:01:24.360> you'll<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
line the next thing you'll want to do is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.870 
line the next thing you'll want to do is
go<00:01:26.250> ahead<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.299> plug<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.810> unit<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.790> an

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
go ahead and plug the unit in to an

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.179 
go ahead and plug the unit in to an
available<00:01:30.090> power<00:01:30.479> power<00:01:31.229> source<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.920> would

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
available power power source I would

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
available power power source I would
recommend<00:01:33.060> hooking<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.049> into<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> surge

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
recommend hooking it into a surge

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.950 
recommend hooking it into a surge
protector<00:01:34.590> first<00:01:38.420> once<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> machine<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
protector first once the machine is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.050 
protector first once the machine is
powered<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.560> you'll<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> phone

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
powered up you'll take the phone

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.359 
powered up you'll take the phone
connector<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.259> usually<00:01:43.439> two<00:01:43.649> lines<00:01:44.159> on
