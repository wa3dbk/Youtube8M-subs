00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
phenomenal and it really does I at two

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.850 
phenomenal and it really does I at two
moments<00:00:46.360> I'm<00:00:46.480> recording<00:00:47.140> without<00:00:47.289> a<00:00:47.500> pop

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
moments I'm recording without a pop

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.430 
moments I'm recording without a pop
filter<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:48.640> as<00:00:48.789> you<00:00:48.910> can<00:00:49.030> hear<00:00:49.090> it's<00:00:49.719> actually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
filter so as you can hear it's actually

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.500 
filter so as you can hear it's actually
really<00:00:50.590> really<00:00:50.829> good<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.300> don't

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
really really good because you don't

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.310 
really really good because you don't
even<00:00:52.660> need<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:52.960> pop<00:00:53.260> filter<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:55.960> that

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
even need a pop filter for it and that

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.840 
even need a pop filter for it and that
is<00:00:56.500> really<00:00:56.710> competing<00:00:57.280> its<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:57.820> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
is really competing its that is a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
is really competing its that is a
problem<00:00:58.420> with<00:00:58.629> with<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.289> lot<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.769> like<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.870> more

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
problem with with a lot of like the more

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.590 
problem with with a lot of like the more
expensive<00:01:02.350> microphones<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:04.210> might<00:01:04.420> need<00:01:04.540> a

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
expensive microphones you might need a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.140 
expensive microphones you might need a
pop<00:01:04.870> filter<00:01:05.110> or<00:01:05.530> also<00:01:06.010> if<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:06.460> really<00:01:06.910> really

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
pop filter or also if it's really really

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.630 
pop filter or also if it's really really
close<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.450> your<00:01:07.840> face<00:01:08.230> this<00:01:08.980> is<00:01:09.190> like<00:01:09.340> really

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
close to your face this is like really

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.670 
close to your face this is like really
you<00:01:10.150> know<00:01:10.270> stuffed<00:01:10.660> up<00:01:10.840> on<00:01:10.990> your<00:01:11.140> face<00:01:11.410> then

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
you know stuffed up on your face then

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.370 
you know stuffed up on your face then
you<00:01:11.799> might<00:01:12.189> need<00:01:12.400> one<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.990> microphone

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
you might need one with this microphone

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.499 
you might need one with this microphone
it<00:01:14.710> actually<00:01:15.100> isn't<00:01:15.250> an<00:01:15.400> issue<00:01:15.700> because<00:01:16.299> you

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
it actually isn't an issue because you

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.690 
it actually isn't an issue because you
can<00:01:16.659> actually<00:01:16.930> have<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.320> at<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:18.009> you<00:01:18.580> know

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
can actually have it at a you know

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.050 
can actually have it at a you know
comfortable<00:01:19.210> distance<00:01:20.140> away<00:01:20.470> from<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:21.100> so

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
comfortable distance away from you so

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.149 
comfortable distance away from you so
you<00:01:22.150> don't<00:01:22.330> need<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.840> have<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.140> shut<00:01:23.409> down<00:01:23.470> your

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
you don't need to have it shut down your

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.690 
you don't need to have it shut down your
throat<00:01:24.460> really<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.530> pretty<00:01:26.680> nice<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.220> it's

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
throat really it's pretty nice and it's

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700 
throat really it's pretty nice and it's
really<00:01:28.090> really<00:01:28.479> good<00:01:28.689> you<00:01:29.290> could<00:01:29.500> actually

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
really really good you could actually

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.100 
really really good you could actually
you<00:01:30.280> know<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.759> use<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.420> longer

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
you know you can use it at a longer

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.370 
you know you can use it at a longer
distance<00:01:32.259> which<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.880> sound<00:01:34.180> quality<00:01:34.930> does

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
distance which the sound quality does

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.590 
distance which the sound quality does
get<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.829> little<00:01:36.340> bit<00:01:36.460> lower<00:01:36.670> but<00:01:36.939> not<00:01:37.149> too<00:01:37.420> much

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
get a little bit lower but not too much

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.260 
get a little bit lower but not too much
which<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.259> is<00:01:38.770> really<00:01:39.070> nice<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.610> like<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.210> a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
which is is really nice I like that in a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.980 
which is is really nice I like that in a
microphone<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.630> know<00:01:43.750> when<00:01:43.960> you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
microphone and then you know when you

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.530 
microphone and then you know when you
record<00:01:44.740> close<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.250> like<00:01:45.430> I<00:01:45.490> am<00:01:45.700> right<00:01:45.880> now<00:01:45.939> it
