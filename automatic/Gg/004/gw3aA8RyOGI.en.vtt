okay<00:00:01.530> well<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.870> was<00:00:03.870> cleaning<00:00:04.080> up<00:00:04.319> my<00:00:04.529> desk<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
okay well I was cleaning up my desk and

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.089 
okay well I was cleaning up my desk and
I<00:00:05.629> found<00:00:06.859> my<00:00:07.859> first<00:00:09.110> gun<00:00:10.110> what<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I found my first gun what the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.079 
I found my first gun what the
interchangeable<00:00:11.880> parts<00:00:12.740> that<00:00:13.740> would<00:00:13.860> take

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
interchangeable parts that would take

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.660 
interchangeable parts that would take
cartridges<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> yeah<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.890> actually<00:00:17.250> kind<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
cartridges so yeah it's actually kind of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.929 
cartridges so yeah it's actually kind of
small<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.529> yeah<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.859> felt<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.550> making

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
small but yeah I felt like making

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.870 
small but yeah I felt like making
something<00:00:21.119> small<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.410> very<00:00:22.680> simple<00:00:23.189> hook

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
something small so it's very simple hook

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.910 
something small so it's very simple hook
and<00:00:24.210> lever<00:00:24.840> mechanism<00:00:26.240> yeah<00:00:27.240> that's<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> me

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
and lever mechanism yeah that's the me

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.680 
and lever mechanism yeah that's the me
mainspring<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:30.570> these<00:00:31.230> these<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.309> by<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
mainspring and these these are just by a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.090 
mainspring and these these are just by a
lighter<00:00:33.690> spring<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> springs<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.800> found<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
lighter spring the springs I found a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.319 
lighter spring the springs I found a
lighter<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.780> simple<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> thing<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> don't

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
lighter so very simple the thing I don't

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
lighter so very simple the thing I don't
like<00:00:39.480> about<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.530> doesn't<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
like about this is well doesn't have a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.920 
like about this is well doesn't have a
proper<00:00:41.690> reach<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> Shelton's<00:00:44.640> too<00:00:44.930> often

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
proper reach so the Shelton's too often

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
proper reach so the Shelton's too often
pop<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.950> shoot<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.489> no<00:00:47.789> big

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
pop out when you shoot it but no big

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.240 
pop out when you shoot it but no big
deal<00:00:48.180> cuz<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.200> hits<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.100> fly

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
deal cuz it just hits this and it fly

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.910 
deal cuz it just hits this and it fly
off<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.879> doesn't<00:00:51.149> fly<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.600> face<00:00:51.920> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
off so it doesn't fly into my face so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.490 
off so it doesn't fly into my face so
yeah<00:00:53.239> what<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.329> shoots<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.370> two<00:00:56.370> millimeter

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
yeah what it shoots is a two millimeter

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.970 
yeah what it shoots is a two millimeter
projectile<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:59.359> pencil<00:01:00.359> lids<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> yeah<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
projectile or pencil lids so yeah you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
projectile or pencil lids so yeah you
just<00:01:02.129> snap<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> pencil<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.000> half<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
just snap the pencil in half and you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
just snap the pencil in half and you
know<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> lid<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.500> stick<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> in

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
know get the lid out and stick it in

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.020 
know get the lid out and stick it in
here<00:01:05.990> put<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> tape<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.670> tape<00:01:08.820> them

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
here put the tape I just put tape them

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.810 
here put the tape I just put tape them
on<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.400> it's<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.580> big

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
on there because you know it's not a big

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.500 
on there because you know it's not a big
deal<00:01:12.030> really

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
deal really

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.609 
deal really
I<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.680> tape<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.760> cap<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I just tape a little cap on to it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.980 
I just tape a little cap on to it
the<00:01:17.250> ones<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.610> come<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> sheet<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> roll

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the ones that come in a sheet the roll

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
the ones that come in a sheet the roll
caps<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:20.009> take<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
caps and I take one of these as a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
caps and I take one of these as a
propellant<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.710> address<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
propellant just one address and put it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.890 
propellant just one address and put it
in<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.970> yeah<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.479> think

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
in there and that's it so yeah I think

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.010 
in there and that's it so yeah I think
I'll<00:01:28.740> disassemble<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I'll disassemble it right now so it's a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.429 
I'll disassemble it right now so it's a
45<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> small

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
45 so you can see it's kind of small

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.340 
45 so you can see it's kind of small
well<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> yeah<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:38.720> these<00:01:39.720> pins<00:01:40.020> are

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
well so yeah these are these pins are

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.880 
well so yeah these are these pins are
the<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.860> paper<00:01:41.040> clips<00:01:42.049> that's<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the little paper clips that's for the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.160 
the little paper clips that's for the
barrel<00:01:44.960> there<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.369> there's<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> barrel

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
barrel there we go there's the barrel

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.109 
barrel there we go there's the barrel
okay

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
okay

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.380 
okay
and<00:01:51.219> actually<00:01:52.219> let<00:01:52.640> me<00:01:52.700> take<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.969> spring<00:01:53.270> out

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and actually let me take the spring out

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.399 
and actually let me take the spring out
first<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:54.170> hammer<00:01:54.409> spring<00:01:55.539> there<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.659> go<00:01:56.810> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
first the hammer spring there you go and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.789 
first the hammer spring there you go and
the<00:01:58.219> hammer<00:01:59.530> comes<00:02:00.530> out<00:02:00.679> very<00:02:01.039> easy<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
the hammer comes out very easy and the

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.859 
the hammer comes out very easy and the
trigger<00:02:04.479> that's<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.659> trigger<00:02:05.869> spring<00:02:06.459> and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
trigger that's the trigger spring and

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.630 
trigger that's the trigger spring and
then<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:10.640> cooperative<00:02:11.150> part<00:02:11.569> here<00:02:12.580> there<00:02:13.580> you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
then on cooperative part here there you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.660 
then on cooperative part here there you
go<00:02:14.260> there's<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.489> trigger<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:19.069> how<00:02:19.489> it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
go there's the trigger so how it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.610 
go there's the trigger so how it
operates<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:23.120> very<00:02:23.360> simple<00:02:23.780> start<00:02:24.500> off

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
operates is it's very simple start off

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.690 
operates is it's very simple start off
like<00:02:24.799> that<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:26.920> cock<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.099> hammer<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.459> back

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
like that you cock the hammer it back

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.589 
like that you cock the hammer it back
and<00:02:30.010> basically<00:02:31.010> hooks<00:02:31.280> onto<00:02:31.459> this<00:02:31.670> spot<00:02:32.360> right

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
and basically hooks onto this spot right

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.420 
and basically hooks onto this spot right
there<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.700> pull<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.629> on<00:02:35.810> hooks<00:02:36.110> and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
there and you pull it it on hooks and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.809 
there and you pull it it on hooks and
the<00:02:37.430> hammer<00:02:38.680> disengaged<00:02:40.060> engages<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.470> yeah

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
the hammer disengaged engages so yeah

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.330 
the hammer disengaged engages so yeah
very<00:02:43.819> simple<00:02:44.239> hook<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.599> lover<00:02:45.340> mechanism
