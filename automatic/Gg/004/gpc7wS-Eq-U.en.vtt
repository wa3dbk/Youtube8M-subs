but the sweet deal is we left the wheels

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.040 
but the sweet deal is we left the wheels
that<00:03:01.400> were<00:03:01.490> on<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.760> car<00:03:01.940> on<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.180> car<00:03:02.450> he

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
that were on the car on the car he

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.230 
that were on the car on the car he
traded<00:03:03.410> us<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.950> these<00:03:04.700> are<00:03:04.850> ultimately<00:03:05.120> going

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
traded us and these are ultimately going

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.190 
traded us and these are ultimately going
to<00:03:05.300> go<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.570> Oldsmobile<00:03:06.700> BAM

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
to go on the Oldsmobile BAM

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.330 
to go on the Oldsmobile BAM
set<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> for<00:03:10.000> 15-inch<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:12.140> rears<00:03:12.440> are<00:03:12.890> wider

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
set a for 15-inch the rears are wider

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.110 
set a for 15-inch the rears are wider
than<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> front

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
than the front

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.210 
than the front
so<00:03:15.080> I'm<00:03:15.200> guessing<00:03:15.380> they're<00:03:15.620> probably<00:03:15.800> eats<00:03:16.070> in

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
so I'm guessing they're probably eats in

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.190 
so I'm guessing they're probably eats in
the<00:03:16.310> back<00:03:16.490> that's<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.600> back<00:03:17.780> room<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.080> can

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the back that's the back room you can

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.780 
the back that's the back room you can
see<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.470> deep<00:03:18.650> lip<00:03:18.860> there's<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> box<00:03:19.490> pack

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
see that deep lip there's the box pack

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.060 
see that deep lip there's the box pack
right<00:03:20.060> now<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.990> rear<00:03:21.200> tires<00:03:21.440> somebody<00:03:21.920> to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
right now the rear tires somebody to

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.260 
right now the rear tires somebody to
burn<00:03:22.250> out<00:03:22.400> with<00:03:22.580> them<00:03:22.700> but<00:03:22.790> they<00:03:22.880> got<00:03:22.910> lots<00:03:23.150> of

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
burn out with them but they got lots of
