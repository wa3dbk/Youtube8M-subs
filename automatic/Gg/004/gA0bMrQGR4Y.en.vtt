basket<00:01:19.459> the<00:01:20.459> second<00:01:20.910> stage<00:01:21.209> is<00:01:21.630> inside<00:01:22.140> you'll

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
basket the second stage is inside you'll

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
basket the second stage is inside you'll
see<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.399> looks<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.789> tall<00:01:24.330> black<00:01:24.720> stick

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
see it it looks like a tall black stick

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.359 
see it it looks like a tall black stick
you<00:01:25.410> pull<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:25.800> straight<00:01:26.069> out<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
you pull it straight out and it is

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
you pull it straight out and it is
another<00:01:29.369> filter<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.110> cleaned

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
another filter which just can be cleaned

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.830 
another filter which just can be cleaned
and<00:01:31.590> put<00:01:31.800> back<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.250> again<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:33.090> third<00:01:33.450> stage

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and put back in again the third stage

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.900 
and put back in again the third stage
filter<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.830> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> compression

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
filter is actually in the compression

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.580 
filter is actually in the compression
chamber<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.660> right<00:01:36.840> down<00:01:37.080> at<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> bottom

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
chamber it's right down at the bottom

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.029 
chamber it's right down at the bottom
it's<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.489> most<00:01:38.700> difficult<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> clean<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
it's the most difficult to clean so you

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.370 
it's the most difficult to clean so you
want<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.640> keep<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:42.300> stage<00:01:42.599> 1<00:01:43.380> 2<00:01:44.069> &amp;<00:01:44.369> 4<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:46.020> clean

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
want to keep the stage 1 2 &amp; 4 as clean

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.589 
want to keep the stage 1 2 &amp; 4 as clean
as<00:01:46.530> possible<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.250> it'll<00:01:47.910> minimize<00:01:48.090> the
