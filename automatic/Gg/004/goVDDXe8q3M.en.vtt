problem here is as you can see I had to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
problem here is as you can see I had to
pull<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> door<00:00:31.740> panel<00:00:32.130> off<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.550> rear<00:00:32.730> door

panel here because it's a common problem

where<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.120> wires<00:00:36.809> seem<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> rot<00:00:38.309> after<00:00:39.149> about

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
where the wires seem to rot after about

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119 
where the wires seem to rot after about
10<00:00:39.570> years<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.140> break<00:00:40.320> off<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> cannot

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
10 years and break off and you cannot

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.010 
10 years and break off and you cannot
open<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> door<00:00:41.969> anymore<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> handle

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
open the door anymore with the handle

what<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> did<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.250> mine<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.820> different

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
what I did on mine is a little different

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
what I did on mine is a little different
than<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> other<00:00:45.600> videos<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.230> seen<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.680> YouTube

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
than the other videos I seen on YouTube

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
than the other videos I seen on YouTube
and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> quicker<00:00:48.090> simpler<00:00:48.600> way

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and I think it's a quicker simpler way

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.639 
and I think it's a quicker simpler way
of<00:00:48.780> taking<00:00:49.260> care<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> problem<00:00:51.590> there's<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
of taking care of the problem there's a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.790 
of taking care of the problem there's a
lever<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.059> top<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
lever here at the top you can see and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
lever here at the top you can see and
the<00:00:56.370> wire<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.059> sometimes<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> becomes

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the wire in there sometimes it becomes

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
the wire in there sometimes it becomes
way<00:00:58.230> too<00:00:58.260> loose<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.100> there's<00:00:59.460> some

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
way too loose because there's some

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
way too loose because there's some
little<00:00:59.899> fittings<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.410> catches<00:01:01.920> on

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
little fittings and little catches on

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.830 
little fittings and little catches on
the<00:01:02.190> interior<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> door<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> believe<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the interior the door that I believe in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
the interior the door that I believe in
some<00:01:04.559> cases<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.180> basically

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
some cases right off to just basically

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200 
some cases right off to just basically
hold<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> original<00:01:07.979> wire<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.430> place<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
hold the original wire in place as you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.539 
hold the original wire in place as you
can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> did<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.280> took<00:01:11.310> some

can see what I did here is I took some

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
can see what I did here is I took some
speaker<00:01:12.180> wire<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> had<00:01:12.750> plenty<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> speaker

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
your shoulder it works for me I didn't

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
your shoulder it works for me I didn't
think<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.050> would<00:02:22.200> my<00:02:22.709> first<00:02:22.950> time<00:02:23.160> doing<00:02:23.340> this

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
think it would my first time doing this

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.880 
think it would my first time doing this
it's<00:02:24.180> my<00:02:24.360> own<00:02:24.510> idea<00:02:25.050> here<00:02:25.290> again<00:02:25.500> as<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.770> can

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's my own idea here again as you can

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.910 
it's my own idea here again as you can
see<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.870> use<00:02:27.870> speaker<00:02:28.350> wire<00:02:28.560> I

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
see on the bottom I use speaker wire I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.850 
see on the bottom I use speaker wire I
tied<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.120> main<00:02:30.420> cable<00:02:30.959> here<00:02:31.260> which<00:02:31.680> was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
tied this main cable here which was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.309 
tied this main cable here which was
causing<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.310> problem<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> bottom<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
causing the problem on the bottom to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.280 
causing the problem on the bottom to
make<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.770> more<00:02:34.950> erect<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.989> didn't

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
make it more erect so that it didn't

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.020 
make it more erect so that it didn't
have<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.560> slack<00:02:37.860> where<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.370> wasn't<00:02:38.790> pulling

have the slack where it wasn't pulling

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
have the slack where it wasn't pulling
the<00:02:39.209> latch<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.660> now<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.230> speaker<00:02:41.130> wire

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400

how<00:03:06.540> simply<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.110> did<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:10.280> I'm<00:03:11.280> sure<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.640> can

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
how simply I did this I'm sure you can
