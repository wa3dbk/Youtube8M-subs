you can find something like that at

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.030 
you can find something like that at
wherever<00:02:50.499> local<00:02:51.280> hardware<00:02:51.609> stores<00:02:51.909> you<00:02:52.060> have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
wherever local hardware stores you have

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.449 
wherever local hardware stores you have
and<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.219> this<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.549> helmets<00:02:55.200> obviously

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you need to put the screws on the inside

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.050 
you need to put the screws on the inside
of<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.469> helmet<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.920> opposite<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.400> put<00:03:00.609> two<00:03:00.939> of

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.420 

just<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.840> safe<00:03:14.050> screws<00:03:14.770> I<00:03:14.890> guess

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
just a safe screws I guess

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.110 
just a safe screws I guess
so<00:03:17.030> mix<00:03:17.239> up<00:03:17.359> some<00:03:17.510> rondo<00:03:17.959> time<00:03:18.849> or<00:03:19.849> i<00:03:19.909> guess

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
so mix up some rondo time or i guess

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.970 
so mix up some rondo time or i guess
that<00:03:20.719> is<00:03:20.810> weird<00:03:21.019> it's<00:03:21.230> time<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.530> mix<00:03:21.680> up<00:03:21.859> some

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
that is weird it's time to mix up some

now if I wanted to but yeah this one you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.339 
now if I wanted to but yeah this one you
can<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.430> once<00:04:05.700> it's<00:04:05.849> carrying<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.689> makes<00:04:07.200> a

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
can see once it's carrying it it makes a

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.190 
can see once it's carrying it it makes a
pretty<00:04:07.500> huge<00:04:07.799> lump<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.659> clay<00:04:09.659> type<00:04:10.079> of

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
pretty huge lump of clay type of

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.030 
pretty huge lump of clay type of
textured<00:04:11.180> material<00:04:12.470> agarrando<00:04:13.470> there<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:13.980> you

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
textured material agarrando there so you

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.999 
textured material agarrando there so you
want<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.310> cut<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.519> off<00:04:14.610> with<00:04:14.760> uh<00:04:14.849> with<00:04:15.739> a<00:04:16.739> razor

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
want to cut it off with uh with a razor

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.719 
want to cut it off with uh with a razor
blade<00:04:17.160> or<00:04:17.959> any<00:04:18.959> type<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.199> blade<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.500> guess<00:04:19.739> to

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
blade or any type of blade I guess to

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.730
