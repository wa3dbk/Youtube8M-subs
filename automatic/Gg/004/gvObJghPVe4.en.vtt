hi<00:00:00.450> my<00:00:00.690> name<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.870> Ken<00:00:01.110> Marcou<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:02.100> going

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi my name is Ken Marcou and I'm going

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.390 
hi my name is Ken Marcou and I'm going
to<00:00:02.340> talk<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.520> little<00:00:02.700> bit<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.030> tuning<00:00:03.419> drums

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 
to talk a little bit about tuning drums

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.789 
to talk a little bit about tuning drums
the<00:00:05.400> drums<00:00:05.600> have<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.660> top<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.290> bottom<00:00:07.319> head

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the drums have a top and a bottom head

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.790 
the drums have a top and a bottom head
which<00:00:08.760> need<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.059> resonate<00:00:09.630> together<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.559> a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
which need to resonate together in a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.980 
which need to resonate together in a
harmonious<00:00:10.920> way<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.549> more<00:00:14.960> more<00:00:15.960> than

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
harmonious way this is more more than

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.010 
harmonious way this is more more than
anything<00:00:16.320> trial<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.279> error<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.810> just<00:00:18.810> kind

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
anything trial and error and just kind

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.540 
anything trial and error and just kind
of<00:00:19.050> hitting<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.560> until<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> son<00:00:20.010> good<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.369> be

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
of hitting it until it son good to be

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.109 
of hitting it until it son good to be
quite<00:00:20.910> honest<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.130> bugs<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.789> go

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
quite honest but there are bugs that go

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.650 
quite honest but there are bugs that go
around<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.510> drum<00:00:24.689> these<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.500> bugs<00:00:25.740> here

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
around the drum these are bugs here

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.990 
around the drum these are bugs here
every<00:00:27.660> drum<00:00:27.869> has<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
every drum has them and what they do is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.810 
every drum has them and what they do is
they<00:00:30.210> hold<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> drum<00:00:31.920> head<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
they hold the drum head which is this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.250 
they hold the drum head which is this
thing<00:00:33.030> right<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
thing right here this is what you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.040 
thing right here this is what you
actually<00:00:34.469> hit<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.450> top<00:00:36.660> drum<00:00:36.899> head

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
actually hit this is the top drum head

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.280 
actually hit this is the top drum head
is<00:00:37.140> called<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> batter<00:00:37.590> head<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:39.270> bottom<00:00:40.050> drum

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is called a batter head the bottom drum

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.490 
is called a batter head the bottom drum
head<00:00:40.530> underneath<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.460> drum<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.260> called<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
head underneath the drum is called a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.119 
head underneath the drum is called a
resonant<00:00:44.160> n<00:00:44.870> both<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.230> resume<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:47.010> at

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
resonant n both of them resume I'm at

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.560 
resonant n both of them resume I'm at
the<00:00:47.280> res<00:00:47.399> name<00:00:47.579> together<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> good

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the res name together to get a good

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.709 
the res name together to get a good
sounding<00:00:48.899> drum<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
sounding drum to do that the way I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.500 
sounding drum to do that the way I
typically<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:53.399> thing<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
typically do it is first thing I do is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
typically do it is first thing I do is
to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> top<00:00:55.379> head<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.980> I'll<00:00:56.760> mute<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> bottom

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
to the top head and I'll mute the bottom

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.869 
to the top head and I'll mute the bottom
head<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.899> hand<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
head with my hand now it's not not a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.869 
head with my hand now it's not not a
perfect<00:01:00.180> science<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.930> works<00:01:01.430> from<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
perfect science but it works from here I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
perfect science but it works from here I
hit<00:01:03.300> each<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> lug<00:01:04.199> locations<00:01:04.920> which

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
hit each one of the lug locations which

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
hit each one of the lug locations which
you<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.790> basically<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.450> hit<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.020> front

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you know basically I hit right in front

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
you know basically I hit right in front
of<00:01:07.350> each<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> lugs<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.330> try<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
of each one of the lugs and you try to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.620 
of each one of the lugs and you try to
get<00:01:09.720> each<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:09.930> sounding<00:01:11.270> more<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.330> less<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
get each one sounding more or less the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:25.999 
get each one sounding more or less the
same<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:24.200> now<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.530> less<00:01:25.740> each

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
same so like so now more or less each

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.340 
same so like so now more or less each
one<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> those<00:01:26.430> hits<00:01:26.729> were<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> same

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
one of those hits were about the same

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
one of those hits were about the same
tone<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:29.340> were<00:01:29.460> several<00:01:29.729> differences

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
tone there were several differences

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
tone there were several differences
though<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.229> i<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.799> my

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
though and from there i would take my

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.550 
though and from there i would take my
drum<00:01:32.369> key<00:01:32.610> which<00:01:33.540> i<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:35.130> keychain

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
drum key which i have on my keychain

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.830 
drum key which i have on my keychain
which<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.740> attached<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.460> times

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
which is attached to me at all times

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
which is attached to me at all times
believe<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> where<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
believe it or not and this is where the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
believe it or not and this is where the
drum<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> me<00:01:42.450> looks<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:45.079> more<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.170> less<00:01:46.290> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
drum to me looks like more or less you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.550 
drum to me looks like more or less you
use<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.360> manipulate<00:01:48.360> below<00:01:48.689> screw<00:01:49.229> which

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
use this to manipulate below screw which

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.740 
use this to manipulate below screw which
is<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> drum<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.149> tighten<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.570> or

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
is on the drum and you can tighten it or

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.749 
is on the drum and you can tighten it or
loosen<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> depending<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.220> lug

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
loosen it depending on if that lug

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.690 
loosen it depending on if that lug
location<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.659> too<00:01:55.350> high<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.890> too<00:01:55.920> low<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.490> pitch

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
location is too high or too low in pitch

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.490 
location is too high or too low in pitch
if<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.570> too<00:01:57.719> low<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> pitch<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
if it's too low in pitch you want to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.800 
if it's too low in pitch you want to
tighten<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.130> lug<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.390> pitch<00:02:00.570> goes

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
tighten the lug so that the pitch goes

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.160 
tighten the lug so that the pitch goes
up<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.890> too<00:02:02.509> high<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> bit<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
up if it's too high a bit you want to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.749 
up if it's too high a bit you want to
loosen<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.649> lug<00:02:04.770> location<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
loosen the lug location so that the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.730 
loosen the lug location so that the
pitch<00:02:05.969> goes<00:02:06.329> down<00:02:06.659> don't<00:02:07.170> demonstrate<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
pitch goes down don't demonstrate that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.960 
pitch goes down don't demonstrate that
here<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.670> hit<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.149> location

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
here if I hit this location

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.470 
here if I hit this location
and<00:02:12.970> then<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.990> loosen<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.150> hear<00:02:19.300> that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and then I loosen it you can hear that

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.420 
and then I loosen it you can hear that
pitch<00:02:19.660> change<00:02:20.050> pretty<00:02:20.530> substantially<00:02:21.190> that's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
pitch change pretty substantially that's

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.880 
pitch change pretty substantially that's
just<00:02:21.580> one<00:02:21.849> lug<00:02:22.120> location<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.380> usually<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
just one lug location so usually you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.800 
just one lug location so usually you
want<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.489> very<00:02:24.819> subtly<00:02:25.209> by<00:02:25.510> turning

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
want to do this very subtly by turning

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.040 
want to do this very subtly by turning
each<00:02:26.050> log<00:02:26.290> location<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.670> subtly<00:02:28.390> now<00:02:28.959> I'm

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
each log location very subtly now I'm

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.300 
each log location very subtly now I'm
going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> pitch<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.590> back<00:02:29.800> up<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.100> where<00:02:30.130> it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
going to pitch this back up to where it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:39.000 
going to pitch this back up to where it
was<00:02:30.340> generally<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:38.440> here<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.620> want<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.890> go

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
was generally and from here I want to go

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070 
was generally and from here I want to go
around<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> whole<00:02:39.519> drum<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.090> match<00:02:40.630> all<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
around the whole drum and match all the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.400 
around the whole drum and match all the
pitches<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.090> from<00:02:43.090> there<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.480> want<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.319> do

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
pitches and from there you want to do

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.750 
pitches and from there you want to do
that<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.890> bottom<00:02:45.040> head<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.610> make<00:02:45.730> sure

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that on the bottom head and make sure

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.890 
that on the bottom head and make sure
each<00:02:46.180> tone<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.319> each<00:02:47.800> head<00:02:48.250> works<00:02:49.060> together<00:02:49.420> so

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
each tone on each head works together so

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.949 
each tone on each head works together so
that<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.110> drum<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.650> end<00:02:51.160> sounds<00:02:51.760> nice

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
that the drum and the end sounds nice

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.640 
that the drum and the end sounds nice
that's<00:02:52.959> high<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.440> new<00:02:53.650> drums<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.250> nutshell
