the side and this is my gaming PC and I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.240 
the side and this is my gaming PC and I
built<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.050> 2<00:02:32.260> months<00:02:32.530> ago<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.980> I'm<00:02:33.100> not

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
built this 2 months ago and I'm not

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.950 
built this 2 months ago and I'm not
going<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> go<00:02:33.550> into<00:02:33.700> much<00:02:33.940> detail<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.600> but

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
going to go into much detail with it but

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.480 
going to go into much detail with it but
it<00:02:35.050> has<00:02:35.230> an<00:02:35.410> AMD<00:02:35.680> r9<00:02:36.010> 280<00:02:36.610> GPU<00:02:37.240> an<00:02:37.450> FX<00:02:37.990> 6300<00:02:38.560> CPU

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
it has an AMD r9 280 GPU an FX 6300 CPU

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.520 
it has an AMD r9 280 GPU an FX 6300 CPU
