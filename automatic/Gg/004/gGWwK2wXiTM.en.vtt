all right so the VIP is plugged in let's
turn<00:00:23.099> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> bike<00:00:27.500> should<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.650> an<00:00:28.739> amber

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
turn on the bike should be an amber

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.410 
turn on the bike should be an amber
light<00:00:33.500> supposedly<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> amber<00:00:34.829> light<00:00:34.980> means

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
light supposedly the amber light means

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
light supposedly the amber light means
software's<00:00:36.420> updating<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> would<00:00:44.399> go

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
software's updating so it would go

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:59.700 
software's updating so it would go
through<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> bunch<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.300> different<00:00:45.450> phases

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:12.249 

light<00:01:00.310> still<00:01:00.670> amber<00:01:02.790> hopefully<00:01:03.790> it's<00:01:03.910> working

it<00:01:14.450> may<00:01:14.630> freeze<00:01:15.380> or<00:01:15.950> look<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.670> not

it may freeze or look like it's not
doing<00:01:17.180> anything<00:01:20.439> but<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.710> entire<00:01:22.189> process

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
doing anything but the entire process

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.980 
doing anything but the entire process
can<00:01:22.670> take<00:01:22.880> up<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:24.070> 15<00:01:25.070> minutes

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
supposedly each time the speedometer

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.029 
supposedly each time the speedometer
goes<00:01:30.079> through<00:01:30.319> this<00:01:30.439> series<00:01:32.439> it's<00:01:33.439> loading<00:01:33.860> a

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
goes through this series it's loading a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.850 
goes through this series it's loading a
different<00:01:34.689> piece<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.929> software<00:01:36.289> onto<00:01:36.770> the
