today<00:00:05.339> i'm<00:00:05.609> going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> be<00:00:05.879> making<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.480> cheat<00:00:06.779> for

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
today i'm going to be making a cheat for

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.799 
today i'm going to be making a cheat for
typing<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.890> dead<00:00:08.160> overkill<00:00:08.570> the<00:00:09.570> first

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
typing of the dead overkill the first

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.499 
typing of the dead overkill the first
step<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.440> process<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:11.160> agent<00:00:12.059> locate

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
step in this process is agent locate

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.090 
step in this process is agent locate
where<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.860> health<00:00:13.860> value<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.790> memory<00:00:16.100> so

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
where the health value is in memory so

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.310 
where the health value is in memory so
I'm<00:00:17.670> gonna<00:00:17.820> use<00:00:17.910> cheat<00:00:18.359> engine<00:00:18.390> I'm<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.260> to

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I'm gonna use cheat engine I'm going to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.359 
I'm gonna use cheat engine I'm going to
scan<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.550> initial<00:00:20.939> help<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.869> 10

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
scan for the initial help which is 10

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.529 
scan for the initial help which is 10
I'm<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> go<00:00:23.670> ahead<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.330> one

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I'm going to go ahead and get it one

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.640 
I'm going to go ahead and get it one
time<00:00:24.810> scan<00:00:25.529> 49<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.960> looks<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.500> gonna

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
time scan 49 and it looks like I'm gonna

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220 
time scan 49 and it looks like I'm gonna
get<00:00:28.890> lucky<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.510> only<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.960> three

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
get lucky this time and I only get three

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.000 
get lucky this time and I only get three
results<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:33.320> obviously<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.219> middle<00:00:35.399> one

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
results so obviously it's the middle one

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.639 
results so obviously it's the middle one
if<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.190> wandering<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.910> last<00:00:39.180> eight<00:00:39.649> just

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
if you're wandering the last eight just

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.950 
if you're wandering the last eight just
the<00:00:40.829> third<00:00:41.070> value<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.480> scan

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the third value that it the scan

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.650 
the third value that it the scan
returned<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:46.789> think<00:00:47.789> its<00:00:47.940> graphical

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
returned is just a I think its graphical

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020 
returned is just a I think its graphical
or<00:00:48.840> something<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:50.039> anyway<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:50.940> going

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
or something but anyway so we're going

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.639 
or something but anyway so we're going
to<00:00:51.120> open<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.510> hot<00:00:51.780> dng<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.890> um<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.469> make<00:00:55.469> sure

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to open up hot dng and um I to make sure

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.130 
to open up hot dng and um I to make sure
we<00:00:55.980> load<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> resources<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> we're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we load the resources and we're going to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
we load the resources and we're going to
go<00:00:58.289> ahead<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.500> import<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.309> debug

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
go ahead and import the debug

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.880 
go ahead and import the debug
information<00:01:05.540> like<00:01:06.540> most<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> steam<00:01:07.530> games

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
information like most of the steam games

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.539 
information like most of the steam games
this<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:09.060> debugger<00:01:09.930> protection<00:01:10.590> built-in<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
this has debugger protection built-in so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.330 
this has debugger protection built-in so
we're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.540> use<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> stealth

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
we're going to need to use I to stealth

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.810 
we're going to need to use I to stealth
and<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> use<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.950> few<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> options

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and I want to use as few of the options

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.270 
and I want to use as few of the options
as<00:01:18.299> possible<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.380> make<00:01:19.560> rebase<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
as possible just to make rebase and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.929 
as possible just to make rebase and
quicker<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.820> easier<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> see

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
quicker and easier so as you can see

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.859 
quicker and easier so as you can see
here<00:01:24.240> I've<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> few<00:01:25.080> options<00:01:25.320> checked

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
here I've only got a few options checked

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.749 
here I've only got a few options checked
so<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.229> ahead<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> click<00:01:28.650> OK<00:01:29.130> make<00:01:29.520> sure

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so we go ahead and click OK make sure

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.390 
so we go ahead and click OK make sure
that<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.900> sort<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.009> done<00:01:32.189> up

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that that is all sort of done up

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
that that is all sort of done up
properly<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.900> we're<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> select<00:01:34.409> our

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
properly then we're going to select our

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
properly then we're going to select our
debugger<00:01:35.130> which<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.060> win32

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
debugger which is going to be the win32

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
debugger which is going to be the win32
debugger<00:01:37.579> button<00:01:38.579> start<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.700> wait<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
debugger button start it and wait for it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
debugger button start it and wait for it
to<00:01:42.090> rebase<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.930> we're<00:01:43.619> actually<00:01:43.799> only

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to rebase and we're actually only

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
to rebase and we're actually only
looking<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.090> rebase<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.590> all

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
looking to rebase right now that's all

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.679 
looking to rebase right now that's all
that<00:01:46.950> matters<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.270> throw<00:01:48.540> an

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that matters it's going to throw an

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.830 
that matters it's going to throw an
error<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.320> it'll<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.680> okay<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.479> goes<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
error but it'll be okay so here goes the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.170 
error but it'll be okay so here goes the
air<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.040> ahead<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> we'll<00:01:53.610> stop

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
air then we can go ahead and we'll stop

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.249 
air then we can go ahead and we'll stop
the<00:01:54.630> debugger<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.299> then<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the debugger and then what we can do is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
the debugger and then what we can do is
actually<00:01:58.530> attached<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> game<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.790> go

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
actually attached to the game so we go

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.910 
actually attached to the game so we go
ahead<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.299> attach<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.930> hot<00:02:04.079> d<00:02:04.380> ng<00:02:04.829> txt

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.470 

I<00:02:14.440> was<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.620> making<00:02:16.010> sure<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.580> was<00:02:16.760> in

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
I was just making sure that it was in

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.199 
I was just making sure that it was in
game<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.930> not<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.230> pause<00:02:18.410> menu<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> anyway<00:02:20.180> um

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
game and not the pause menu so anyway um

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.430 
game and not the pause menu so anyway um
go<00:02:23.209> ahead<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.510> open<00:02:23.540> up<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.959> debugger<00:02:24.290> and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
go ahead and open up the debugger and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.830 
go ahead and open up the debugger and
then<00:02:24.650> we're<00:02:24.800> going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> jump<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.480> address

ESI in the movie SI function call so
we'll<00:03:30.620> add<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.739> breakpoint<00:03:31.040> there<00:03:31.579> just<00:03:31.880> to

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
we'll add a breakpoint there just to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.759 
we'll add a breakpoint there just to
make<00:03:32.180> sure<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:34.630> what's<00:03:35.630> gonna<00:03:35.930> happen<00:03:36.049> is

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
make sure and what's gonna happen is

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.610 
make sure and what's gonna happen is
we'll<00:03:37.190> go<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.519> get<00:03:37.670> hit<00:03:37.940> it'll<00:03:38.510> come<00:03:38.690> here<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
we'll go and get hit it'll come here and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.979 
we'll go and get hit it'll come here and
we<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.890> see<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.280> health<00:03:40.579> is<00:03:40.820> nine<00:03:41.150> currently

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
we can see that health is nine currently

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.720 
we can see that health is nine currently
and<00:03:43.209> in<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.510> EDI<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.079> is<00:03:45.590> eight<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.549> that's

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
and in the EDI it is eight and so that's

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.699 
and in the EDI it is eight and so that's
what's<00:03:46.970> going<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.390> be<00:03:47.540> moved<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:48.049> that's<00:03:48.380> going

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
what's going to be moved in that's going

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.580 
what's going to be moved in that's going
to<00:03:48.769> change<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.549> health<00:03:49.700> from<00:03:49.940> nine<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.359> eight

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
to change the health from nine to eight

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.580 
to change the health from nine to eight
in<00:03:51.590> other<00:03:51.769> words<00:03:52.040> decrease<00:03:52.609> it<00:03:52.790> by<00:03:52.819> one<00:03:53.590> so

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
in other words decrease it by one so

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.410 
in other words decrease it by one so
this<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.220> instruction<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.970> we<00:03:56.090> want<00:03:56.299> to

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
this is the instruction that we want to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.490 
this is the instruction that we want to
change<00:03:58.420> go<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.600> copy<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.319> address<00:04:02.350> will<00:04:03.350> go

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
change go and copy that address will go

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.020 
change go and copy that address will go
into<00:04:03.739> cheat<00:04:04.130> engine<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.709> we're<00:04:07.519> going<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.880> add

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
into cheat engine and we're going to add

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.449 
into cheat engine and we're going to add
address<00:04:08.420> manually<00:04:11.889> change<00:04:12.889> it<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.130> array<00:04:13.430> of

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
address manually change it to array of

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.820 
address manually change it to array of
bytes<00:04:14.230> default<00:04:15.230> length<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.739> okay<00:04:17.769> go<00:04:18.769> ahead

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
bytes default length is okay go ahead

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.250 
bytes default length is okay go ahead
and<00:04:18.919> change<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.729> hexadecimal<00:04:20.390> so<00:04:21.109> that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
and change that to hexadecimal so that

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.470 
and change that to hexadecimal so that
we<00:04:21.349> can<00:04:21.560> compare<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.099> to<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.580> original

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
we can compare it to the original

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.040 
we can compare it to the original
array<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.840> bytes<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.500> Ida<00:04:25.840> we're<00:04:26.840> going<00:04:26.960> to

the breakpoint so I just need to turn
off<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.610> breakpoint<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:01.130> reason<00:05:01.430> I'm<00:05:01.550> doing

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
off the breakpoint the reason I'm doing

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.440 
off the breakpoint the reason I'm doing
this<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:02.330> that<00:05:02.510> i<00:05:02.720> can<00:05:02.870> copy<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:04.550> array<00:05:05.420> of

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
this is so that i can copy the array of

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.410 
this is so that i can copy the array of
bytes<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:06.940> rescan<00:05:07.940> for<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.540> which<00:05:09.230> seems<00:05:10.420> kind

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
bytes and rescan for it which seems kind

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.630 
bytes and rescan for it which seems kind
of<00:05:11.510> pointless<00:05:11.570> but<00:05:12.200> what<00:05:12.350> i<00:05:12.380> want<00:05:12.620> is<00:05:12.920> the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
of pointless but what i want is the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.880 
of pointless but what i want is the
relative<00:05:14.210> virtual<00:05:14.750> address<00:05:15.400> instead<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.730> the

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
relative virtual address instead of the

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.250 
relative virtual address instead of the
just<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.130> static<00:05:20.230> address<00:05:21.230> that<00:05:21.860> we<00:05:21.950> get<00:05:22.190> from

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
just the static address that we get from

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.780 
just the static address that we get from
adding<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.380> manually<00:05:25.040> so<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.400> will<00:05:25.580> give<00:05:25.760> us

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
adding it manually so this will give us

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
adding it manually so this will give us
an<00:05:26.060> offset<00:05:26.570> from<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.960> exe<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:28.660> we're<00:05:29.660> going

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
an offset from the exe and we're going

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.220 
an offset from the exe and we're going
to<00:05:29.870> use<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.470> make<00:05:30.650> our<00:05:30.830> trainer<00:05:31.160> and

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
to use that to make our trainer and

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.660 
to use that to make our trainer and
instead<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.380> starting<00:05:33.860> from<00:05:34.040> scratch<00:05:34.250> i'm

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
instead of starting from scratch i'm

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.100 
instead of starting from scratch i'm
just<00:05:34.850> going<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.090> open<00:05:35.150> up<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.840> one<00:05:35.990> i've

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
just going to open up the one i've

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.670 
just going to open up the one i've
already<00:05:36.290> written<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:38.870> give<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.230> an<00:05:39.320> idea<00:05:39.440> of

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
already written just give you an idea of

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.270 
already written just give you an idea of
what<00:05:39.770> it'll<00:05:40.040> look<00:05:40.160> like<00:05:40.340> it's<00:05:41.830> a<00:05:42.830> pretty

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
what it'll look like it's a pretty

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.940 
what it'll look like it's a pretty
cookie<00:05:43.670> cutter<00:05:43.990> you'll<00:05:44.990> just<00:05:45.290> when<00:05:45.710> you<00:05:45.800> do

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
cookie cutter you'll just when you do

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.740 
cookie cutter you'll just when you do
your<00:05:46.160> own<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.550> can<00:05:46.580> do<00:05:46.790> this<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.000> exact<00:05:47.510> same

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
your own you can do this the exact same

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.430 
your own you can do this the exact same
thing<00:05:48.050> you'll<00:05:48.320> just<00:05:48.530> change<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:50.540> address<00:05:50.870> and

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
thing you'll just change the address and

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.950 
thing you'll just change the address and
what<00:05:51.650> uh<00:05:52.030> whatever<00:05:53.030> goes<00:05:53.450> into<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.810> new

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
what uh whatever goes into the new

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.260 
what uh whatever goes into the new
memory<00:05:54.350> label<00:05:54.740> what<00:05:55.670> you<00:05:55.850> do<00:05:56.000> is<00:05:56.120> you<00:05:56.240> just

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
memory label what you do is you just

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.720 
memory label what you do is you just
copy<00:05:56.720> that<00:05:57.080> address<00:05:57.260> and<00:05:57.860> you'll<00:05:58.190> paste<00:05:58.430> it

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
copy that address and you'll paste it

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.990 
copy that address and you'll paste it
here<00:05:58.760> where<00:05:59.600> you<00:05:59.780> see<00:05:59.810> it<00:06:00.170> and<00:06:00.880> then<00:06:01.880> what

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
here where you see it and then what

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.450 
here where you see it and then what
you're<00:06:02.180> going<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.360> do<00:06:02.540> is<00:06:02.750> you<00:06:02.960> go<00:06:03.140> to<00:06:03.460> then

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
you're going to do is you go to then

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.100 
you're going to do is you go to then
you're<00:06:04.670> going<00:06:04.790> to<00:06:04.850> jump<00:06:05.120> down<00:06:05.270> here<00:06:05.600> this<00:06:05.840> new

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
you're going to jump down here this new

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.110 
you're going to jump down here this new
memory<00:06:06.500> area<00:06:07.510> and<00:06:09.220> i'm<00:06:10.220> showing<00:06:10.820> i<00:06:10.940> guess

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
memory area and i'm showing i guess

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.150 
memory area and i'm showing i guess
still<00:06:11.300> disabled<00:06:11.900> now<00:06:12.050> but<00:06:12.680> anyway<00:06:13.010> the

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
still disabled now but anyway the

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.480 
still disabled now but anyway the
disabled<00:06:13.670> code<00:06:13.850> is<00:06:14.030> just<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.390> original<00:06:14.840> ALB

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
disabled code is just the original ALB

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.540 
disabled code is just the original ALB
so<00:06:16.490> that's<00:06:16.880> really<00:06:17.390> easy<00:06:17.480> to<00:06:17.750> get<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.170> then<00:06:19.040> um

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
so that's really easy to get and then um

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.650 
so that's really easy to get and then um
you<00:06:19.910> can<00:06:20.030> see<00:06:20.240> it<00:06:20.360> there<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:22.270> for<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.510> new

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
you can see it there and for the new

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.720 
you can see it there and for the new
memory<00:06:24.080> though<00:06:24.290> we're<00:06:24.620> going<00:06:24.980> to<00:06:25.160> change<00:06:25.460> the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
instead of EDI and so that means

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.870 
instead of EDI and so that means
instead<00:06:39.000> of<00:06:39.030> moving<00:06:39.720> whatever's<00:06:40.350> an<00:06:40.500> EDI<00:06:40.880> into

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
instead of moving whatever's an EDI into

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.340 
instead of moving whatever's an EDI into
the<00:06:42.030> health<00:06:42.830> area<00:06:44.360> of<00:06:45.360> memory<00:06:45.840> we're<00:06:46.140> just

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
the health area of memory we're just

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.930 
the health area of memory we're just
going<00:06:46.470> to<00:06:46.500> move<00:06:46.710> into<00:06:46.920> n<00:06:47.160> so<00:06:47.460> it's<00:06:47.640> always

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
going to move into n so it's always

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.510 
going to move into n so it's always
going<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.210> be<00:06:48.270> 10<00:06:51.560> you<00:06:52.560> could<00:06:52.740> probably<00:06:52.950> go<00:06:53.490> a

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
going to be 10 you could probably go a

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.810 
going to be 10 you could probably go a
little<00:06:53.730> bit<00:06:53.940> further<00:06:54.240> with<00:06:54.510> this<00:06:54.750> and

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
little bit further with this and

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.060 
little bit further with this and
actually<00:06:56.820> find<00:06:57.540> out<00:06:57.750> like<00:06:58.050> what<00:06:58.110> functions

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
actually find out like what functions

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.520 
actually find out like what functions
calling<00:06:59.640> what<00:07:00.330> when<00:07:00.540> you<00:07:00.660> get<00:07:00.870> hit<00:07:01.050> and<00:07:01.350> then

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
calling what when you get hit and then

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.910 
calling what when you get hit and then
actually<00:07:02.990> disable<00:07:03.990> the<00:07:04.140> whole<00:07:04.290> thing<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.890> that

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
actually disable the whole thing so that

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.100 
actually disable the whole thing so that
you<00:07:05.160> don't<00:07:05.400> ever<00:07:08.030> lose<00:07:09.030> combos<00:07:09.660> and<00:07:09.690> stuff

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
you don't ever lose combos and stuff

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.860 
you don't ever lose combos and stuff
like<00:07:10.320> that<00:07:10.380> but<00:07:11.120> you<00:07:12.120> know<00:07:12.180> I'm<00:07:12.420> not<00:07:12.630> going<00:07:12.810> to

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
like that but you know I'm not going to

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.900 
like that but you know I'm not going to
really<00:07:12.990> worry<00:07:13.320> about<00:07:13.410> that<00:07:13.890> it<00:07:14.640> sort<00:07:14.880> of

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
really worry about that it sort of

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.180 
really worry about that it sort of
defeats<00:07:15.300> the<00:07:15.300> purpose<00:07:16.970> of<00:07:17.970> the<00:07:18.120> game<00:07:18.330> I<00:07:18.630> guess

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
defeats the purpose of the game I guess

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.490 
defeats the purpose of the game I guess
anyway<00:07:20.190> I'm<00:07:20.430> done<00:07:20.790> hacking<00:07:21.240> this<00:07:21.480> hope<00:07:22.350> you

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
anyway I'm done hacking this hope you

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.770 
anyway I'm done hacking this hope you
had<00:07:22.620> fun
