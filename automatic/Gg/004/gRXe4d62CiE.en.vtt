absolutely<00:02:07.480> good<00:02:07.960> as<00:02:08.080> new<00:02:08.470> before<00:02:09.039> after

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
absolutely good as new before after

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.420 
absolutely good as new before after
after<00:02:10.630> before<00:02:10.840> before<00:02:11.350> after<00:02:11.770> look<00:02:12.220> at<00:02:12.280> that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
after before before after look at that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.580 
after before before after look at that
and<00:02:12.880> that's<00:02:13.060> all<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.330> takes<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.410> that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and that's all it takes and we do that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.430 
and that's all it takes and we do that
probably<00:02:14.980> every<00:02:15.940> few<00:02:16.150> months<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.320> as

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
probably every few months and it's as

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.840 
probably every few months and it's as
simple<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.220> I'm<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.490> crack<00:02:18.670> on

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
simple as it is so I'm going to crack on

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.210 
simple as it is so I'm going to crack on
with<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.210> get<00:02:19.930> these<00:02:20.080> done<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.920> I'll<00:02:21.070> show

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
with this get these done and I'll show

with this get these done and I'll show
you<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.550> when<00:02:21.670> they're<00:02:21.790> finished<00:02:25.620> and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
as you can see if about ten minutes I've

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.660 
as you can see if about ten minutes I've
gone<00:02:31.450> around<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.810> wheel<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.459> pretty

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
gone around the wheel and it's pretty

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.930 
gone around the wheel and it's pretty
much<00:02:33.760> got<00:02:34.120> everything<00:02:34.209> off<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:35.580> check<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:36.730> way

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
much got everything off I check this way

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.140 
much got everything off I check this way
back<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> black<00:02:38.520> scotch<00:02:39.520> brite<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.970> check

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
back with a black scotch brite to check

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.940 
back with a black scotch brite to check
if<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:40.420> white<00:02:40.750> was<00:02:40.930> coming<00:02:41.230> off<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> just

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
if this white was coming off and it just

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.800 
if this white was coming off and it just
doesn't<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.670> seems<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.239> be<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> solid

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
doesn't it just seems to be a solid

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.170 
doesn't it just seems to be a solid
white<00:02:44.020> rubber<00:02:44.320> so<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.130> seems<00:02:45.400> safe<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.850> can't

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
white rubber so it seems safe I can't

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.910 
white rubber so it seems safe I can't
see<00:02:46.300> where<00:02:46.420> your<00:02:46.570> tires<00:02:46.840> made<00:02:47.140> off<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.530> what
