00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
sandstorm and then he begins with

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.890 
sandstorm and then he begins with

the<00:05:47.240> right<00:05:47.480> side<00:05:47.810> are<00:05:48.020> better<00:05:48.290> than<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.800> ones

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
the right side are better than the ones

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:58.270
