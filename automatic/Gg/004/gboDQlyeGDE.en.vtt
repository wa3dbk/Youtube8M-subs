get<00:02:14.430> ahead<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.850> field<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:15.300> bit<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
get ahead in the field a little bit and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510 
get ahead in the field a little bit and
try<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.050> introduce<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> top<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.370> the

or 10 or 15 minutes long and it means

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
or 10 or 15 minutes long and it means
that<00:03:36.630> there's<00:03:36.750> going<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:36.989> times<00:03:37.230> when<00:03:37.500> I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
that there's going to be times when I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.350 
that there's going to be times when I
have<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.950> record<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.430> clip<00:03:38.610> min<00:03:38.760> stop<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.300> in

have to record the clip min stop and in

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.090 
have to record the clip min stop and in
record<00:03:39.630> again<00:03:39.989> I'm<00:03:40.380> not<00:03:40.440> going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.769> capture

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
record again I'm not going to capture

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.590 
record again I'm not going to capture
everything<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.580> want<00:03:41.850> I'm<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.450> have

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
everything that I want I'm going to have

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.449 
everything that I want I'm going to have
to<00:03:42.630> stop<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.170> start<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.800> then<00:03:43.920> peace<00:03:44.220> all<00:03:44.370> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
to stop and start and then peace all the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.090 
to stop and start and then peace all the
clips<00:03:44.670> together<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.769> think<00:03:46.800> they've

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
clips together and I think they've

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.610 
clips together and I think they've
really<00:03:47.340> really<00:03:48.090> they've<00:03:48.989> really<00:03:49.019> messed<00:03:49.440> out

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
really really they've really messed out

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.410 
really really they've really messed out
here<00:03:49.830> because<00:03:50.010> within<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.820> next<00:03:51.000> six<00:03:51.239> months

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
here because within the next six months

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.610 
here because within the next six months
or<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> year<00:03:51.720> there's<00:03:52.080> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.380> lot<00:03:52.560> of

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
or a year there's going to be a lot of

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.290 
or a year there's going to be a lot of
cameras<00:03:53.040> coming<00:03:53.220> out<00:03:53.370> by<00:03:53.910> other<00:03:54.060> companies

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
cameras coming out by other companies

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.610 
cameras coming out by other companies
perhaps<00:03:54.840> Cameron's<00:03:55.200> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.410> release<00:03:55.560> a

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
perhaps Cameron's going to release a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.740 
perhaps Cameron's going to release a
successor<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.400> g<00:03:56.489> 7<00:03:56.880> eggs<00:03:57.030> or<00:03:57.360> perhaps

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
successor to the g 7 eggs or perhaps

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.720 
successor to the g 7 eggs or perhaps
we're<00:03:58.019> going<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.200> see<00:03:58.350> another<00:03:58.830> one<00:03:59.040> being

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
we're going to see another one being

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.970 
we're going to see another one being
released<00:04:00.090> by<00:04:00.209> another<00:04:01.110> company<00:04:01.320> some<00:04:01.709> strong

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
released by another company some strong

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.110 
released by another company some strong
or<00:04:02.160> something<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:02.790> they're<00:04:02.970> going<00:04:03.060> to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
or something like they're going to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.940 
or something like they're going to
release<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.450> camera<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:03.930> small<00:04:04.170> as<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.410> rx100

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
release a camera as small as the rx100

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.360 
release a camera as small as the rx100
that<00:04:05.580> offers<00:04:06.030> four<00:04:06.269> key<00:04:06.450> but<00:04:06.690> without<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
that offers four key but without the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.660 
that offers four key but without the
time<00:04:08.370> restriction<00:04:09.380> time<00:04:10.380> will<00:04:10.500> tell<00:04:10.680> but<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:11.220> do

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
time restriction time will tell but I do

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.250 
time restriction time will tell but I do
think<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.390> really<00:04:12.720> putting<00:04:12.959> me<00:04:13.019> off<00:04:13.080> from

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
think it's really putting me off from

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.570 
think it's really putting me off from
getting<00:04:13.560> rx100<00:04:14.010> no<00:04:14.870> but<00:04:15.919> there<00:04:16.919> is<00:04:17.040> one<00:04:17.340> good

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
getting rx100 no but there is one good

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.949 
getting rx100 no but there is one good
thing<00:04:17.609> about<00:04:17.820> all<00:04:18.269> these<00:04:18.450> come<00:04:18.660> has<00:04:18.840> been

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
thing about all these come has been

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.420 
thing about all these come has been
released<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.440> it's<00:04:19.560> quite<00:04:19.979> an<00:04:20.070> obvious<00:04:20.310> one

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
released and it's quite an obvious one

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.360 
released and it's quite an obvious one
whenever<00:04:21.120> new<00:04:21.419> cameras<00:04:21.810> are<00:04:21.930> being<00:04:22.080> released

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
whenever new cameras are being released

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.200 
whenever new cameras are being released
whenever<00:04:23.370> they're<00:04:23.520> been<00:04:23.610> announced<00:04:24.090> and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
whenever they're been announced and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.150 
whenever they're been announced and
shortly<00:04:25.020> before<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.500> actually<00:04:25.770> released

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
shortly before that actually released

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.629 
shortly before that actually released

the previous

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.360 
the previous
models<00:04:27.849> drop<00:04:28.330> in<00:04:28.479> play<00:04:28.689> square<00:04:28.990> back<00:04:29.229> so<00:04:30.009> I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
models drop in play square back so I

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.939 
models drop in play square back so I
would<00:04:31.120> maybe<00:04:31.240> be<00:04:31.419> another<00:04:31.719> month<00:04:31.900> or<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.229> that
