00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.319
 it was ok geeks and geekettes these 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.030
 videos was I hope you did well 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.620
 here we go for a new video 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 memory game dofus 1 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 it was a hunt between plague the sacred 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.330
 almost legendary dofus so the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 there is 2 menalt who is one of the most 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 first players to be level arrival 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.130
 2 did not care a brute in pvp 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.769
 annoying pvm and he wiped kaiser's she 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.750
 who weighed during the menal server soon 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.780
 that they reach 196 at the time so 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.969
 he did not have access to staff yet 199 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.649
 so that was the panoply go all this 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.719
 which was usually the whole 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.410
 difference at the time was very very 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.890
 interesting 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.510
 of course to resituate you see here 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.870
 who examined it with the case this carnage 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.289
 so he is with stocks 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 today we would not use pvp anymore 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.870
 but at the time there was not much 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.850
 thing one like stuff so that's it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 made with what we had see scourge 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 he will play finally he plays with early lugar 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.049
 as a hammer and and that's good back then 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.939
 it was not there was not a very choice 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.920
 very high as now as she 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.070
 was there lugar early also tell you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.119
 very often beautiful logar early it was 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.670
 really a very very good staff 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.320
 finally for the pvp because actually 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.939
 the 400 points of life that gave 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 it was huge for the pines that is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.420
 no ipad stuff like that that gave 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 4,100 points of life it's a trick of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 crazy and conveyed lugar toros 10 and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.470
 wau thing gives 400 life 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.600
 it's huge, it's good, it steals from the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.220
 life as it is a hammer and more 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.650
 ozone so it was nickel for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.240
 the pvp 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.930
 it's true that I too had a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.310
 weak for the hammer m inches which 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.380
 had the defect of not stealing from the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.440
 life but who instead withdraw pea 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.850
 and so that's okay it would win a 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.160
 advantage place on the opponent which I 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.450
 find it very interesting 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.300
 so that's all that to say that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.710
 kyle reese she had a little he had 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.840
 a little disadvantage what about this fight 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 sacred did not yet have access to the staff 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.310
 very high level it was all the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.860
 difference and actually even 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.950
 when we are level 199 we really have a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.709
 advantage over the guy who level 198 and 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.780
 who can not wear the same stuff and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.070
 on the other hand then with the hassle 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.740
 the time which was pretty crazy it's 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.030
 that on the one hand it was pretty cool 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.230
 to be able to walk around the world 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.180
 of dofus because when we had a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.560
 contract on a guy it could be that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.540
 could be anywhere nearly end 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.890
 there were some certain areas on 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.000
 could not see contraction with by 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.650
 example when they were safe in a 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.150
 dungeon what seen he was at it's 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.780
 impossible to go the trail is good there 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.430
 there was no jitters but there against 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.870
 we had the opportunity to walk around 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.740
 so one full of places from the game of 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.060
 it is true that at the time 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.250
 players who made trains 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.570
 know very well all the areas of 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.190
 dofus which is not the case currently where 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.810
 people are just going to frigost because 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.140
 anyway there's no need to go 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.780
 elsewhere 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.489
 but the problem is that there were maps 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.400
 very unbalanced for example on this 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.260
 map exile pool out of teleporting cac he 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.260
 still has this possibility in taste 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.000
 to do can rotate round the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.800
 sacrier if they use doors of 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.330
 deportations quite often there 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.920
 frankly it's frankly that's all 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350
 to his honor but 15:10 ali who is this 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.240
 not that kind of technique but let's say 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.580
 than when we see this map 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.380
 it was the kind of mapou there 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.730
 had way to have big big anti game 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.350
 by classes that have 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.200
 teleportations donzÃ© laure makes that 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.510
 diop also at one time the iob could 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.490
 you could do two good everywhere 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.350
 so you imagine the thing it was 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.840
 worse than toffees wandering everywhere 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.760
 on the maps was pretty awful 1 2 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.280
 when we were forced yop who is who 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.520
 was running away I sometimes saw 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.020
 fights that lasted 3 4 with one side a 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.480
 guy who is proud to pursue a iop 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.830
 elliott that was that double good at 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.510
 every time so it was finally the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.280
 game of the most con what is the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.010
 more stupid than the other and it was always 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.240
 the most conquered win that's a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.860
 little bit sad with the games of the most 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.060
 we know it's the most stupid 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.920
 what remains the longest in the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.120
 fight which ended up winning so 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.430
 there was certainly a very block 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.840
 very reputed safe but do not alter 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.510
 I imagine on the eight servers too 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.250
 for the notorious anti-game time and the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.270
 double good techniques finally he 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.310
 use that when he fell against a 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.060
 opponent against whom they were 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.590
 sure to lose 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.830
 he used the technique of double good 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.720
 to make the fight last by telling oneself 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.609
 if I wait and shit 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.500
 my opponent for an hour or two 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.410
 he does not attack me anymore rats the days 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.730
 following by what will be said no this guy 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.100
 there he is too boring I know he's going 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.120
 to make me the technique of double good he 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.190
 will do that were during the fight 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.450
 so I'm gonna go over the jitters and 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.430
 what finally when I have a contract 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.170
 on him I would leave him alone and he 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.030
 must say that this technique market - 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.010
 there are some games that really have me 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.370
 under the business of the techniques of 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.540
 double good to run away all the time during 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.490
 45 minutes an hour month after I 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.570
 abandoned after one hour but it's 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.160
 true that sometimes I saw fighting 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.380
 it was I think once I was 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.580
 too edgy I did during end I 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.480
 tried to pursue elsewhere during 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.190
 three hours 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.200
 in the end I am no I will do more 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.180
 never that and so that's it for that 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.050
 than 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.310
 personally i hate in dofus 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.200
 the people who make the fight 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.260
 because it reminds me of that time 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.700
 really with a lot of anti play and 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.280
 it was finally here it's horrible 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.480
 to use this kind of technique flee to 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.130
 the other end of the map so all that for 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.750
 to say kaiser gsell who is rather a 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.140
 fair-play player because on this map 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.730
 there he could have used teleportation 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.920
 Finally, more than he did what he 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.830
 could have used also leaked to himself 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.240
 barring and he decided to be earlier he 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.550
 played the man when he played it 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.990
 what you you are evil to you I ebu 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.630
 balance of the big shots of early dougar 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.150
 in the head so 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.590
 So here it was not bad but at the same 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.930
 time it's true that it's hard to flee 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.760
 facing a sacred heart at the time since 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.080
 you may have seen right before 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.270
 flail it uses the technique of 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.100
 sacrifices on his sword 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.610
 so he does they sacrificed on his 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.410
 sword and suddenly at the time sticking them 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.180
 allies we had sacrificed 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.590
 players or invocations 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.530
 were taking damage the sacrier 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.740
 took the place of the invocation or 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.380
 the ally so from the flail blow he launches his 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.420
 sword his ep goes directly to 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.920
 the opponent makes sacrifices on the sword 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.050
 is like that is enough for him to launch a 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.190
 flamish or any spell on his 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.140
 sword could change places with 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.380
 the sword which gives him a mobility 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.420
 additional equal to the number of peace m 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.960
 2 flying sword I think it was 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.670
 4 pm 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.670
 so it's really interesting 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.800
 of course the opponents with m between 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.810
 quotation marks a way of countering that 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.100
 is that the flying sword if you 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.540
 put for example an invocation to 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.289
 next to her she tended to stay 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.259
 soft 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.069
 the bourquaise she who benefits because 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.619
 that he has the zone 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.270
 he can slap on the sword and the sacrier 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:37.680
 who made the sacrifice so blow it 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.460
 allows him to do damage 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.469
 additional 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.610
 there we see who is almost 500 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.149
 damage per shot what is really 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.949
 huge especially at the time 

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:48.330
 at the time it's true that there was 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.379
 no stuff that gave so many points 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.999
 of life and frankly we see we see 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.979
 flail it has rained a lot of life points 

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:57.379
 so does kaiser's go 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.479
 succeed in having it on the next turn 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:02.009
 and no, because this scourge has succeeded in 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.189
 kill him I must say that I think he 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.740
 had good d good boost with the 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:09.089
 punishment of the sacrieur but frankly 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.639
 it was just played 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:13.559
 it was played to a few I would say 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.309
 around 100 health points that's what 

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:16.529
 made the difference 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:18.719
 I hope this little video of 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:21.059
 memories of dofus one you liked it was 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:23.539
