00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.089
 this video my cell phone is in me 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.589
 I like you so much 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 Help as with such a situation 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.639
 gets along in most cases 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 the mobile phone is still working for me 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.219
 that has already happened the mobile phone 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.529
 but we just worked 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.170
 have activated that is just the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.939
 all the time yes that means this power 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.570
 button is broken i can not do it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.130
 use 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 Now I'll show you how to do that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 get it right the second way 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.769
 You can start without the buttons 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.309
 needs all the buttons included 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.980
 For that he goes to the settings and 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.270
 then go to general scrolls here 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.410
 then down and then here is completely 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 down help is very 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.539
 practically 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.969
 Now you go down and do it here 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.590
 assistive touch and undoing 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.149
 and then you did that here 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
 Just go straight to those now 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.350
 At first ignore it for a power 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.879
 button like the home button league 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.020
 seen that does not work that is 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.439
 Of course, really shit how do I get 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.570
 Now back I just click on it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.610
 and here is a free one 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.010
 home button we would not be I am 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.260
 of course, this is always home 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.119
 Button click works the same way 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.110
 back to normal home button i can 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.520
 twice more 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.900
 then comes the down there so it is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 really just like the normal home 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.590
 button 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.360
 I can disable the device that is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.600
 In this case further lock screen 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.770
 turn sound on shake quieter louder 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 everything works as you see and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 You can also switch off the device 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.729
 lock at device and then determined 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.000
 long then that is the case with the mobile phone 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.799
 Well 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 It stinks a bit, though, I'm glad 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.500
 not where it fell for but that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.189
 in any case a very good 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.689
 alternative 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.000
 thanks apple you do not always have to 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.770
