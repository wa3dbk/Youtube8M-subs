I generally bring it around and clip it
to<00:01:34.539> here<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:35.860> hole<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.450> these

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
to here to this hole and this these

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:38.999 
to here to this hole and this these
holes<00:01:37.960> here<00:01:38.079> just<00:01:38.439> you<00:01:38.530> know<00:01:38.649> are<00:01:38.799> like<00:01:38.979> a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
holes here just you know are like a

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.919 
holes here just you know are like a
lineman<00:01:39.280> belt<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.939> what<00:01:40.299> this<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.659> used<00:01:40.840> for

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
lineman belt and what this is used for

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.300 
lineman belt and what this is used for
is<00:01:41.079> when<00:01:41.289> you're<00:01:41.409> putting<00:01:41.649> up<00:01:41.740> tree<00:01:41.950> stands

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
is when you're putting up tree stands

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.070 
is when you're putting up tree stands
you<00:01:42.369> can<00:01:42.520> put<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> belt<00:01:43.090> around<00:01:43.270> hook<00:01:43.869> onto

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
you can put a belt around hook onto

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.839 
you can put a belt around hook onto
these<00:01:44.319> and<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.890> lean<00:01:45.039> back<00:01:45.069> which<00:01:45.610> allows

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
these and you can lean back which allows

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.399 
these and you can lean back which allows
you<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.360> be<00:01:46.509> hands-free<00:01:46.869> when<00:01:47.049> you're<00:01:47.259> putting

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
you to be hands-free when you're putting

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.339 
you to be hands-free when you're putting
tree<00:01:47.619> stands<00:01:47.860> which<00:01:48.009> is<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.189> huge<00:01:48.459> advantage

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
tree stands which is a huge advantage

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.719 
tree stands which is a huge advantage
so<00:01:50.349> this<00:01:50.560> harness<00:01:50.770> system<00:01:51.009> has<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> lot<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.610> good

so this harness system has a lot of good

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.490 
so this harness system has a lot of good
features<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.020> your<00:01:53.170> tether<00:01:53.380> that

features to it this is your tether that
goes<00:01:53.799> on<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.069> tree<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.789> gonna<00:01:54.909> wrap<00:01:55.179> around

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
goes on the tree it's gonna wrap around

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.289 
goes on the tree it's gonna wrap around
and<00:01:55.599> clip<00:01:55.840> then<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.530> clip<00:01:56.829> your<00:01:57.299> carabiner

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
and clip then you clip your carabiner

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.990 
and clip then you clip your carabiner
right<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.899> that's<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.829> so<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.700> doesn't<00:02:00.939> make

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
right to it that's so so it doesn't make

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.130 
right to it that's so so it doesn't make
any<00:02:01.179> sound<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.569> not<00:02:01.630> hitting<00:02:01.869> any<00:02:01.989> other

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
any sound it's not hitting any other

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.679 
any sound it's not hitting any other
metal<00:02:02.349> real<00:02:03.340> simple<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.060> again<00:02:04.450> when<00:02:04.569> you're

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
metal real simple and again when you're

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.270 
metal real simple and again when you're
getting<00:02:04.929> down<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.739> twist<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:06.189> again

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
getting down you just you twist it again

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.300 
getting down you just you twist it again
undo<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.209> and<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:07.959> down<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> tree<00:02:08.470> they

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
undo it and you get down the tree they

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.330 
undo it and you get down the tree they
also<00:02:09.489> have<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.869> lineman<00:02:11.380> system<00:02:11.799> this<00:02:12.160> is

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
also have this lineman system this is

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.220 
also have this lineman system this is
what<00:02:12.459> they<00:02:12.549> call<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.030> lineman<00:02:13.239> belt<00:02:13.599> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
what they call like a lineman belt and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.440 
what they call like a lineman belt and
how<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> works<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.940> goes<00:02:16.120> through<00:02:16.329> these

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
how it works is it goes through these

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
how it works is it goes through these
hooks<00:02:16.690> right<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.040> you're<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.190> slide

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
hooks right here you're going to slide

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.039 
hooks right here you're going to slide
this<00:02:18.579> through<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.299> knot<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.870> this

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
this through you do a knot and this

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.870 
this through you do a knot and this
comes<00:02:20.350> around<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.769> tree<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.489> clip<00:02:21.730> on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
comes around the tree and you clip on

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
comes around the tree and you clip on
over<00:02:22.120> here<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.079> I<00:02:23.109> put<00:02:23.290> enough<00:02:23.440> tree

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
over here so when I put enough tree

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.129 
over here so when I put enough tree
stands<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.790> simply<00:02:25.150> lean<00:02:25.359> back<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.989> can

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:26.139 
stands I can simply lean back and I can

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.750 
stands I can simply lean back and I can
use<00:02:26.290> my<00:02:26.319> hands<00:02:26.709> head<00:02:26.950> my<00:02:27.040> hands<00:02:27.400> have

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
use my hands head my hands have

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.059 
use my hands head my hands have
hands-free<00:02:28.120> literally<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.079> do<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.769> work<00:02:29.950> and

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
hands-free literally and do the work and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.289 
hands-free literally and do the work and
then<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.430> slide<00:02:30.639> up<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:30.970> keep<00:02:31.150> moving

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
then you just slide up and keep moving

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.330 
then you just slide up and keep moving
as<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.630> keep<00:02:31.930> working<00:02:32.079> so<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:32.889> we're<00:02:33.130> putting

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
as you keep working so as we're putting

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.190 
as you keep working so as we're putting
up<00:02:33.430> our<00:02:33.579> climbing<00:02:34.480> sticks<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.840> all<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.079> it's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
up our climbing sticks and all that it's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.809 
up our climbing sticks and all that it's
gonna<00:02:35.319> make<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.709> safe<00:02:35.920> way<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.190> feel<00:02:36.579> safe

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
gonna make for a safe way to feel safe

and know you're secured to the tree they

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.729 
and know you're secured to the tree they
also<00:02:39.310> have<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.579> relief<00:02:40.000> system<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:41.560> is

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
also have a relief system this is

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.809 
also have a relief system this is
something<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.400> cool<00:02:42.579> it's<00:02:42.790> really

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
something it's really cool it's really

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.590 
something it's really cool it's really
important<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.510> know<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:44.410> comes<00:02:44.650> out<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:44.859> this

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
important to know it comes out of this

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.629 
important to know it comes out of this
and<00:02:46.600> how<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:46.959> works<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.440> gonna<00:02:48.160> come<00:02:48.370> out<00:02:48.459> it's

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
and how it works is gonna come out it's

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.059 
and how it works is gonna come out it's
attached<00:02:48.970> directly<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.720> harness<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.380> if

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
attached directly to the harness and if

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.160 
attached directly to the harness and if
you<00:02:51.220> were<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.430> fall<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.060> you're<00:02:52.630> hanging<00:02:52.989> for

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
you were to fall and you're hanging for

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.750 
you were to fall and you're hanging for
a<00:02:53.200> while<00:02:53.380> you're<00:02:53.889> gonna<00:02:54.010> want<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.310> step<00:02:54.579> in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
a while you're gonna want to step in

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.180 
a while you're gonna want to step in
this<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.720> relieve<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.200> pressure<00:02:56.380> off<00:02:56.769> off<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
this to relieve the pressure off off the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.650 
this to relieve the pressure off off the
harness<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.180> don't<00:02:58.359> want<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.569> be

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
harness because you don't want to be

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.930 
harness because you don't want to be
hanging<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.079> harness<00:02:59.440> a<00:03:00.160> whole<00:03:00.670> bunch<00:03:00.849> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
hanging in the harness a whole bunch of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.490 
hanging in the harness a whole bunch of
time<00:03:01.120> without<00:03:01.269> being<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.660> relief<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
time without being on the relief of the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.680 
time without being on the relief of the
pressure<00:03:02.819> that's<00:03:03.819> really<00:03:04.120> important<00:03:04.540> it's

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
pressure that's really important it's

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.449 
pressure that's really important it's
really<00:03:04.900> dangerous<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:06.130> hanging<00:03:06.430> around

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
really dangerous to be hanging around

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.030 
really dangerous to be hanging around
for<00:03:06.790> too<00:03:06.910> long<00:03:07.120> for<00:03:07.510> lots<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.470> reasons<00:03:08.530> you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
for too long for lots of reasons you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.440 
for too long for lots of reasons you
know<00:03:09.130> look<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.489> up<00:03:09.579> online<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.180> can<00:03:10.329> learn

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
know look that up online you can learn

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.839 
know look that up online you can learn
about<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.870> online<00:03:10.989> I'm<00:03:11.680> not<00:03:11.889> a<00:03:11.919> medic<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.760> I'm

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
about it online I'm not a medic so I'm

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:13.979 
about it online I'm not a medic so I'm
not<00:03:12.940> gonna<00:03:13.060> get<00:03:13.239> into<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:13.780> is

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
not gonna get into that but this is

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.420 
not gonna get into that but this is
really<00:03:14.019> important<00:03:14.829> because<00:03:14.889> it's<00:03:15.310> gonna

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
really important because it's gonna

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.580 
really important because it's gonna
relieve<00:03:15.700> pressure<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:17.109> you're<00:03:17.290> hanging

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
relieve pressure and if you're hanging

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.809 
relieve pressure and if you're hanging
there<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.889> can't<00:03:18.160> get<00:03:18.250> back<00:03:18.430> up<00:03:18.609> on<00:03:18.760> the
