the box just yet so we're gonna open

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.740 
the box just yet so we're gonna open
this<00:00:33.750> together<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:35.520> package<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> little

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this together the package is a little

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
this together the package is a little
bit<00:00:36.840> wet<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.200> possibly<00:00:37.710> there's<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> little

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
bit wet so possibly there's a little

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.100 
bit wet so possibly there's a little
puncture<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.030> let's<00:00:39.719> hope

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
puncture in here so let's hope

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.869 
puncture in here so let's hope
everything<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.829> okay<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.579> takes<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
everything is okay but it only takes a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.479 
everything is okay but it only takes a
day<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.270> okay<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:46.640> here<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.090> eggs

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489
