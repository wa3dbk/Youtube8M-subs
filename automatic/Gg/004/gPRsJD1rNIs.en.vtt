units<00:00:10.379> in<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.400> tutorial<00:00:11.549> we're<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> be

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.119 
units in this tutorial we're going to be

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.030 
units in this tutorial we're going to be
examining<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.780> units<00:00:13.200> move<00:00:13.379> around<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.830> map

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
examining how units move around the map

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.980 
examining how units move around the map
so<00:00:14.669> to<00:00:15.000> make<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.330> bit<00:00:15.540> easier<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.870> see

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
so to make it a little bit easier to see

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.359 
so to make it a little bit easier to see
what's<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.439> on<00:00:16.680> we're<00:00:16.950> going<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> use<00:00:17.220> one

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
what's going on we're going to use one

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.659 
what's going on we're going to use one
of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> game<00:00:17.700> options<00:00:18.560> any<00:00:19.560> control<00:00:20.039> options

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
of the game options any control options

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.240 
of the game options any control options
you<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.300> turn<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.720> path<00:00:22.050> lines<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.710> units<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you can turn on path lines for units and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.130 
you can turn on path lines for units and
this<00:00:23.460> will<00:00:23.640> show<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.849> what<00:00:24.000> units<00:00:24.539> currently

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this will show you what units currently

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980 
this will show you what units currently
have<00:00:25.349> orders<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.640> issue<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.210> order<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> unit

have orders to issue in order to a unit

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
have orders to issue in order to a unit
simply<00:00:28.439> select<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> unit<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.400> then

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
simply select the unit and then

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.490 
simply select the unit and then
right-click<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> destination<00:00:30.929> where

right-click on the destination where

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.860 
right-click on the destination where
you'd<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> unit<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> move<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.720> you

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
you'd like the unit to move to if you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
you'd like the unit to move to if you
select<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> hex<00:00:34.500> where<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.010> multiple

select a hex where there are multiple

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.329 
select a hex where there are multiple
units<00:00:35.940> you'll<00:00:36.330> be<00:00:36.449> given<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.720> choice<00:00:36.989> of

given<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.430> modify<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:44.970> unit<00:00:45.330> will<00:00:45.449> act

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
given to modify how the unit will act

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.009 
given to modify how the unit will act
when<00:00:45.900> it<00:00:45.930> reaches<00:00:46.260> its<00:00:46.409> destination<00:00:47.839> once<00:00:48.839> the

unit<00:00:51.420> again<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.019> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.619> the<00:00:52.920> name

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
unit again we can see that the name

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
unit again we can see that the name
shows<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:53.699> different<00:00:54.150> show<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.600> is
