what it looks like here it's just a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.470 
what it looks like here it's just a
small<00:00:15.949> piece<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.460> chuck<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:17.970> near<00:00:18.119> tailstock

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
small piece you chuck up near tailstock

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.810 
small piece you chuck up near tailstock
and<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.410> cut<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> 14<00:00:20.910> mil<00:00:21.920> area<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> Center<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> tip

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and I cut a 14 mil area to Center a tip

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.890 
and I cut a 14 mil area to Center a tip
in<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.170> make<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.670> 13<00:00:26.670> mil<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.810> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
in you can make it 13 mil and you do it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.259 
in you can make it 13 mil and you do it
every<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:29.550> simple<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.119> long

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
every like this is really simple as long

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.110 
every like this is really simple as long
as<00:00:30.390> your<00:00:30.539> lathe<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.990> running<00:00:32.030> pretty<00:00:33.030> good

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
as your lathe is running pretty good

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.670 
as your lathe is running pretty good
it's<00:00:33.960> pretty<00:00:34.290> straightforward<00:00:36.469> not<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it's pretty straightforward not that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.569 
it's pretty straightforward not that
hard<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.219> all

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
hard to do at all

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.770 
hard to do at all
does<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> take<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:39.840> much<00:00:39.989> time<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.640> it's

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
does it take for much time and it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.380 
does it take for much time and it's
pretty<00:00:42.780> accurate<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.059> I've<00:00:45.059> already<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
pretty accurate so I've already got a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.940 
pretty accurate so I've already got a
tip<00:00:45.600> prepared<00:00:47.030> like<00:00:48.030> 2

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
tip prepared like 2

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.350 
tip prepared like 2
go<00:00:50.950> ahead

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
go ahead

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.780 
go ahead
check<00:00:52.989> up<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:54.250> hips<00:00:54.550> entry<00:00:55.090> tool<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:57.340> tailstock

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
check up my hips entry tool my tailstock

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.660 
check up my hips entry tool my tailstock
and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.739> don't<00:00:59.800> know<00:01:00.010> how<00:01:00.129> good<00:01:00.309> this<00:01:00.430> is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
and I don't know how good this is

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.850 
and I don't know how good this is
show<00:01:01.629> up<00:01:02.160> not<00:01:03.809> tested<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:04.900> or<00:01:05.080> anything

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.820 

so<00:01:09.850> we<00:01:10.000> set<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.390> depth<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.810> was<00:01:10.960> sucking<00:01:11.560> up<00:01:11.710> all

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
so we set the depth I was sucking up all

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.440 
so we set the depth I was sucking up all
the<00:01:11.920> way<00:01:12.010> let<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.280> butch<00:01:12.490> push<00:01:12.820> my<00:01:13.000> tail<00:01:13.210> stock

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the way let it butch push my tail stock

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.810 
the way let it butch push my tail stock
back<00:01:15.120> that's<00:01:16.120> where<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.330> like<00:01:16.480> to<00:01:16.600> put<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:17.820> let's

from unique which is a good product that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.070 
from unique which is a good product that
keeps<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.560> tip<00:02:23.770> pretty<00:02:24.070> Center<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.270> remember

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
keeps a tip pretty Center but I remember

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.640 
keeps a tip pretty Center but I remember
when<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.260> used<00:02:26.290> mine<00:02:26.820> had<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.560> sort<00:02:29.560> of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
when I used mine had to be sort of

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.080 
when I used mine had to be sort of
tweaked<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.070> have<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.280> push<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.670> side<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.910> side

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
tweaked you have to push it side to side

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.670 
tweaked you have to push it side to side
in<00:02:31.480> order<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.720> get<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.080> perfectly<00:02:33.300> square<00:02:34.680> so

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
in order to get it perfectly square so

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.680 
in order to get it perfectly square so
this<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.040> making<00:02:36.550> your<00:02:36.700> own<00:02:36.730> seems<00:02:37.570> to

this is just making your own seems to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.360 
this is just making your own seems to
work<00:02:38.130> quite<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> lot<00:02:39.370> better<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:42.010> straight

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.730 
work quite a lot better it's straight
every<00:02:43.209> single<00:02:43.480> time<00:02:43.660> there's<00:02:44.320> no<00:02:44.470> room<00:02:44.709> for

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
every single time there's no room for

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.970 
every single time there's no room for
adjustment<00:02:44.980> because<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.790> has<00:02:46.620> been<00:02:47.620> cut<00:02:47.860> on

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
adjustment because it has been cut on

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.320 
adjustment because it has been cut on
your<00:02:48.100> machine

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
your machine

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.760 
your machine
it<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:49.780> works<00:02:49.959> works<00:02:50.350> out<00:02:50.470> really<00:02:50.620> good

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
it just works works out really good

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.270 
it just works works out really good
really<00:02:51.070> easy<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:53.440> takes<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.740> few<00:02:53.860> seconds<00:02:54.190> a

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
really easy just takes a few seconds a

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
really easy just takes a few seconds a
nice<00:02:54.400> thing<00:02:54.580> about<00:02:54.640> Delrin<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.450> glue

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
nice thing about Delrin is that glue

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.980 
nice thing about Delrin is that glue
doesn't<00:02:55.900> stick<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.780> even<00:02:58.780> if<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.959> put

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
doesn't stick to it so even if you put

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.230 
doesn't stick to it so even if you put
way<00:02:59.320> too<00:02:59.350> much<00:02:59.620> glue<00:02:59.860> on<00:03:00.070> your<00:03:00.100> tip<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.700> it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
way too much glue on your tip and it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.720 
way too much glue on your tip and it
sort<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.810> glues<00:03:02.110> itself<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.830> your<00:03:03.040> tip

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
sort of glues itself to your tip

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.870 
sort of glues itself to your tip
centering<00:03:04.240> device<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.160> give<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.580> spin

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
centering device you just give it a spin

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.680 
centering device you just give it a spin
and<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.540> will<00:03:07.690> break<00:03:08.680> free<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.060> tip<00:03:10.540> I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and it will break free so that tip I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.550 
and it will break free so that tip I
hope<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.590> glued<00:03:11.890> all<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.190> way<00:03:13.080> as<00:03:14.080> much<00:03:14.140> as<00:03:14.440> it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
hope is glued all the way as much as it

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.380 
hope is glued all the way as much as it
should<00:03:14.769> be<00:03:15.550> hope<00:03:15.700> instead<00:03:17.430> look<00:03:18.430> at<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.760> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
should be hope instead look at that it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.750 
should be hope instead look at that it
is<00:03:19.570> pretty<00:03:20.560> square<00:03:20.830> there's<00:03:21.310> not<00:03:21.489> too<00:03:21.610> much

a<00:04:30.430> nice<00:04:31.620> sort<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.680> halfway<00:04:32.860> between<00:04:33.039> a<00:04:33.310> nickel
