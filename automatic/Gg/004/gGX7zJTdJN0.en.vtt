00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 service and welcome to one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.819
 new video and that's fast 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
 trek has a picture of nine minutes 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.639
 posted that from the cinemagic 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.410
 tomorrow's release will be shown and really 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.880
 I do not know what else they are doing 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 want 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.660
 Tomorrow will be the song and the scene 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 magic published here and here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.590
 small teaser you can see a new one 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.619
 robot and honestly erich the me 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 it is precisely this part that destroys me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 somehow I want the old one somehow 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.090
 just back and no new robots though 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.850
 Continue robot with not blue not red 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.579
 Do n't not lose your eyes 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 with purple or white songs 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.879
 or maybe I change blue 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 believe her purple and no idea what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.730
 that is supposed to mean maybe 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.399
 really just a robot color of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.489
 lye and this robot has one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.250
 people's head in hand 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.239
 At first I thought I had this nicolai 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.780
 but then maybe not 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.129
 some warrior just and i believe 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.540
 he just ripped his skull out 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.460
 it also makes you more beautiful cinemagic 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.530
 I think see and then you see 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.509
 course right of course inevitable 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.030
 the no freefight symbol box could 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.170
 but not now thinks it could also 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.570
 but be another group 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 maybe later 95 in any case 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.869
 or another group the game 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.000
 probably under the earth or in 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.119
 destroyed a temple one sees behind 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 right still a mysterious plate and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.600
 What seems to me indescribable 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.700
 are these blue parts do you see that one 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.280
 could think blue eyes now though 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.100
 why is there only one eye to see or 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.950
 only a blue light 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 maybe this map is really damn 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.110
 mysterious and our new group so 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.420
 the old four main characters of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.110
 come meet with the old characters 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.850
 from 1900 still something on it that they 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.009
 maybe they want to prevent something 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.190
 old new characters so the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.380
 want to warn suspect 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.000
 yes I can not really interpret that much 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.590
 He could see for me what it is 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.510
 a robot new robot so me 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.330
 I think I have three different ones now 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.720
 So what will that be 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.240
 I think it will be something like brutus 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.880
 and the others will like it too 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.010
 which are like photos, yes, but no idea 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.560
 we can only wait until tomorrow 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.230
 am really looking forward to the song 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.060
 I am really looking forward to it and myself 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.430
 properly showdown still this education 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.860
 Do not disturb these blue dots since me 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.260
 maybe also wants more files or 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.020
 I do not know if you were because that's it 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.430
 I hope I could update you 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.110
 Update no matter how it is next time 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.110
 how the skin is clean and servus
