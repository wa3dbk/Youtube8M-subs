his<00:01:34.420> claws<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:35.080> rotate<00:01:35.530> 360<00:01:36.310> degrees<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:38.130> does

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
his claws to rotate 360 degrees so does

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.310 
his claws to rotate 360 degrees so does
his<00:01:41.740> arm<00:01:42.070> goes<00:01:42.880> up<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.720> point<00:01:43.990> because

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
his arm goes up to this point because

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.790 
his arm goes up to this point because
there's<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:45.990> piece<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.020> plastic<00:01:47.440> there<00:01:47.620> that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
there's a piece of plastic there that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.290 
there's a piece of plastic there that
prevents<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.370> from<00:01:48.490> going<00:01:48.580> all<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.120> way<00:01:51.300> his

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
prevents it from going all the way his

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.020 
prevents it from going all the way his
other<00:01:52.540> clauses<00:01:52.900> could<00:01:53.260> rotate<00:01:53.410> also<00:01:54.040> 360

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
other clauses could rotate also 360

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.700 
other clauses could rotate also 360
degrees<00:01:56.190> his<00:01:57.190> mom<00:01:58.180> could<00:01:58.450> open<00:01:58.840> here<00:01:59.140> but

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
degrees his mom could open here but

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.530 
degrees his mom could open here but
there's<00:01:59.950> no<00:02:00.130> button<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.000> could<00:02:01.180> open<00:02:01.330> it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
there's no button that could open it

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.400 
there's no button that could open it
right<00:02:01.720> now<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:03.160> really<00:02:03.460> tight<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:05.380> I

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
right now and it's really tight what I

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.440 
right now and it's really tight what I
like<00:02:05.619> about<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.940> mode<00:02:07.180> he<00:02:07.390> could<00:02:07.570> stand<00:02:07.869> up

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
like about this mode he could stand up

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.350 
like about this mode he could stand up
if<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.570> put<00:02:10.810> him<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.140> flat<00:02:12.130> surface<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:13.120> hard

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
if I put him in a flat surface that hard

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.270 
if I put him in a flat surface that hard
surface<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.709> make<00:02:14.860> his<00:02:15.870> head<00:02:16.870> look

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
surface and you can make his head look

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.610 
surface and you can make his head look
straight<00:02:18.280> up<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:20.020> that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.960

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it better in this move because it looks

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.100 
it better in this move because it looks
