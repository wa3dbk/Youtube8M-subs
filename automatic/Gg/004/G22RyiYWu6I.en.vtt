00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.450
 low 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.790
 I will not fail and I can not win 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.360
 as a host is Jesus Christ thing for 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.360

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.730

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.240

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.590
 let's go for a ride with the bike 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.040
 water that we found here here has 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.040
 nothing the same

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.280

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.280
