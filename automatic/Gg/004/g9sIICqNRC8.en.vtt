00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.139
 from the ice in thialf we go to it 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.209
 grass of some skort because there was this 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.770
 week of course also trained hard 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.690
 Sunday does not wait for you the next 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.480
 challenge the away game in the cockpit 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.850
 against Feyenoord certainly is a whole 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.789
 nice competition sold out I hear and 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.439
 so we did well last year 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.939
 we have to return the after the win on pec 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.410
 zwolle did last Saturday 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.730
 Heerenveen hit a hole with the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.019
 competition in the battle for the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.640
 play-offs 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.870
 the number 9 of the premier league fc 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.250
 groningen is already at ten points 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.630
 backlog 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.490
 secretly look a fine here so now 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.320
 if you win then you do very good ones 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.750
 case and then you can again 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 yes they actually compete with them then 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.720
 we will go for it 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.490
 we just have to just be our sunday 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.990
 do the best and just finish them and then 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.920
 we do good business 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.270
 what brands in the group from it 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 now trust it twice in a row 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.480
 then I won a necessary 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.730
 rest 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.260
 yes of course our weather is of course whole 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.230
 well have won now 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.210
 only 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.260
 yes we must continue to focus 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 hold for your 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.190
 are perhaps certain of one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 playoffs but yes I think we have more 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.950
 get out of it 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.110
 what else can you do in terms of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.909
 football or perhaps even in terms of position 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.869
 on the ranking direct placement for 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.930
 european soccer 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.180
 the most important is 100 points and yes it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.619
 football just needs to be much better and better 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.820
 the second half have one 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 show a bit against zwolle 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 and we just have to go on with that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.950
 van basts cannot dispose of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.380
 Mitchell the defenders that some 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 weeks along the side with a groin injury 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.860
 probably stefano marzo himself 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 start playing right back and write pele 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.670
 van anholt to the left back position 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 going to see it later time i quite 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.050
 played little in my own position and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.220
 it's a little everywhere I go everywhere 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.920
 the stand so it's all a part 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.940
 from work a bit 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.080
 multifunctional hair belly 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.880
 Already live a march like it did well 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.590
 as the right back you think so too 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.509
 nice as a left back 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 wet your breast yes we go 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 I am curious and see the trainer 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.399
 certain is no i feyenoord wins one 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.759
 good wing forwards Ruben chess and 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.849
 boetius 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.860
 so how can you turn off on shorter 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:08.069
 sit yes I think so anyway 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.690
 they love when you give space 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.940
 they are very dangerous with a speed so 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 we should not allow that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.290
 I notice that the trust the present 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640
 I have families Heerenveen is already 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.770
 three seasons and undefeated in 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
 rotterdam last season in a blazing hot 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 tub was the team from van boston 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.560
 close to victory but is feyenoord in the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.489
 final phase of the competition 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.130
 to score 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.690
 the roon well given here goes joris 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.590
 slightly faster than math ice cross 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.030
 recently 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.510
 and now the Czech the referee 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.790
 penalty kick 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.830
 penalty kick for heerenveen 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.070
 the violation of what demands and be with 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.810
 debut red and what a disastrous debut 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.290
 for him at feyenoord 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.290
 15 minutes before time 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.790
 eye to eye with mulder 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.260
 security and it is right for heerenveen 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.190
 clasie pounds him redecorating that 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.070
 it is also coming to win chess 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.890
 playing chess 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:16.380
 euro pappu file on button 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.380
 in need for a hundred 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 Coopers whistle as a one is for 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.280
 feyenoord in the first home game 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.840
 disappointing especially after the season 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.819
 the first l of the better team 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.500
 was van bastens picks a point his first 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.500
 point with heerenveen
