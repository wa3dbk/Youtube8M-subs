00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
down but it feels like it's on the floor

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
down but it feels like it's on the floor
hand<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> course<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> feel<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is whether the horse is swinging through

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
is whether the horse is swinging through
behind<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.700> that's<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.600> tell<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
whether or not the horse is going to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.979 
whether or not the horse is going to
develop<00:00:48.030> correctly<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.809> not

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
develop correctly or not

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.770 
develop correctly or not
so<00:00:49.559> Tonya<00:00:50.070> has<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.489> begun<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.120> able<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.600> do

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so Tonya has just begun to be able to do

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.900 
so Tonya has just begun to be able to do
this<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> today<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.280> today<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this and today actually today is the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.040 
this and today actually today is the
first<00:00:54.120> day<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> she's<00:00:54.480> ever<00:00:54.629> had<00:00:54.780> her<00:00:54.899> horse

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

you see how the trot back end isn't
moving<00:01:49.890> any<00:01:50.189> longer<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.299> her<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.540> into

moving any longer now put her back into
a<00:01:51.840> working<00:01:52.320> trot<00:01:52.560> again<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:53.250> her<00:01:53.310> swinging

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
a working trot again get her swinging

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.709 
a working trot again get her swinging
forward<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> active<00:01:56.090> like<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.509> find

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
forward and active like that and find

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
forward and active like that and find
your<00:01:57.899> working<00:01:58.229> trot<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.219> now<00:01:59.310> ask<00:01:59.520> for

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
your working trot there and now ask for

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
your working trot there and now ask for
a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.880> bit<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> comes<00:02:00.719> through<00:02:00.990> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a little bit more so it comes through so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.810 
a little bit more so it comes through so
very<00:02:01.649> often<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.130> find<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.490> people<00:02:02.670> are

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
very often we find that people are

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.459 
very often we find that people are
simply<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.540> moving<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> horses

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
simply just not moving the horses

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.260 
simply just not moving the horses
actively<00:02:05.100> enough<00:02:05.369> forward<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.060> what

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
actively enough forward and that's what

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
actively enough forward and that's what
we<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> very<00:02:07.020> beginning<00:02:07.200> so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
we need to do in the very beginning so

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
we need to do in the very beginning so
there<00:02:08.160> once<00:02:08.399> again<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:08.849> she's<00:02:09.119> gotten<00:02:09.360> her<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
there once again now she's gotten her to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.850 
there once again now she's gotten her to
stretch<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> horse<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> had

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
stretch and this is a horse that had

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.619
