00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.830
 hello this is the channel for you you have 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.310
 the office metalist project found 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.210
 this is the info channel all around team 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.020
 package ticket vice bistros plugins 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.930
 texture pack server configuration 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.920
 I invite you to join us the project 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.460
 advance 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.570
 the parameter list percent and use the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.250
 link in the video description yes today 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.859
 synonymous with us again with votes 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.609
 We want to employ this system 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:52.429
 this time a shop is being cut down 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.289
 locally is working fully automatically 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.289
 you save all personnel costs 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.409
 that is simply no place 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.899
 only very few people tell you they are here 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.370
 rather not even infinity 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.470
 a little bit right and in all 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:12.770
 Models there is a so-called trade 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:16.250
 Pay homage to this credo relatively cheaply 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.050
 and I'll just give it to her 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.170
 then see the graphical user interface 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.620
 and there you can do different things 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.390
 attitude which is quite simple 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.090
 down here just what he does 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.880
 wanted to sell and up here she gives 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.970
 that have a water for word when 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.390
 So I want to sell an oral 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.990
 then I expect that from the opposite 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.480
 we have 54 newspaper report and if 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.670
 I you now talk purely tour and 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.160
 then I get my lead and me 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.220
 I even got over that 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.500
 of course that works completely 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.770
 just by putting it down here, so to speak 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.330
 the interface is installed and there 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.269
 Let's go into what we want to sell 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.019
 very simple and the same for more 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.050
 can make it back here, the quasi 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.510
 want to sell 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.840
 they say okay for a quartz 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.040
 I like to have 50 feet and then give 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.910
 I you times ten or twelve or something 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.220
 no matter in any case find more then find 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.420
 So there are two of them and you 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.570
 also there the remainder star gets again 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.950
 yes what's there, so to speak tricky 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.920
 Of course this must be installed 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.330
 I understand that's why 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.160
 Let's change it here now 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.590
 I'll show you something 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.620
 very briefly here what you in the system 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.220
 So it's almost miles away 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.530
 and koran and no one should not 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.650
 German you learn the whole change the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.930
 we say little for our uran 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.880
 have quartz but we want there saw 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.950
 times because sometimes there are two there for a noble 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.930
 white joke price but it works 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.420
 just to show how easy 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.030
 you can configure that to show 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.220
 Children keep our uran or too 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.130
 our explodes millions again 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.390
 Of course we want to say otherwise 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.300
 what are we doing down here? 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.560
 then we can do the physio meter 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.709
 Of course up here, too, that trains 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:40.050
 set because I have two robbers 1 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.050
 so and then , of course, get sawa 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.989
 there I theoretically get 3 million 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.330
 But that's really true 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.850
 simple story and you can see it 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.989
 At the back we suddenly have it too 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.530
 a few are received 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.310
 The whole thing is really not difficult 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.210
 to build 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.890
 the only thing I do not 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.100
 difficult and that's what I have to do 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.270
 say you have to come up with something 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.160
 That's why I have the red one here too 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.800
 Wired you have to get something 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 come up with how to do the whole thing 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.980
 I'm sure I mean mine inside 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.830
 vice flows to the studies anna matrix 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.050
 are so many possibilities on the go 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.640
 but with which you break something 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.990
 can and can 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.010
 that's terrifying that the model 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.430
 I did not think about that 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.890
 do 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.200
 but you have to do it that way 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.730
 this whole length of the temple 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.910
 consumer not have but in this 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.970
 warehouse system that he has so installed and 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.970
 That's what I can do 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.490
 just grab a hearth plate with it 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.800
 I would actually have everything 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.350
 that would have to do that in the already 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.210
 is the elaborate involved in it and 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.640
 otherwise this really is a super 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.620
 easy affair can create one 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.600
 anyone putting it anywhere says renault 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.490
 was of course allowed 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.690
 yes that was it to say first as I said 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.630
 I already have a system 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.210
 different tutorials to power looks 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.760
 look at you and it is the next great 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.660
 history, we make sure that 100 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.100
 other additional video to look 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.560
 but the others do what comes 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.850
 Above all, subscribe to the channel with it 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.210
 also in the future always up to date 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.240
 be something new effect and then 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.970
 but clearly our way the wiki has that 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.950
 advantage that you initiated relatively 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.500
 search for information and tutorials 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.150
 you do not need a certain addiction 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.010
 eternally follow a youtube playlist 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.810
 but you can do that relatively directly 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.770
 access 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.430
 otherwise I wish you much fun 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.080
 at the replica and has a lot of experience shop 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.870
 The exchange is so good 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.960
 because money is synonymous hardly the art 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.390
 Although not necessary but have one 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.620
 money economy has it too 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.990
 I'll come back to your problems 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.460
 confirm such a tutorial to it is 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.710
 not so easy with the people you 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.410
 would like to have no inflation and if 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.630
 you in an economy in the quasi 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.670
 Everyone has everything if you are there at all 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.740
 still negotiate 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.890
 ok on the target in the first sense until 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.890
 then
