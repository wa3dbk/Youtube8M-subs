00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.000
 this video is on us today 2013 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680
 But do not go that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.820
 all bought for the university and today gives 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:19.140
 it just unboxing a lot of fun there 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 I ask the question as me a macbook 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 air can already come see it 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 This is a very simple miracle cure 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.010
 that's called work going therefore 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 I now also on the macbook air 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.029
 just saved for the university because time 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 really very practical is a thin one 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 but in that case too 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.390
 powerful device to have with you 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.469
 that's the top end configuration like 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 one as well as 1.7 ghz dual core 8 gb ram and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.840
 512 gb ssd because then I also very much 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.070
 So many data will be stored on it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.140
 as I imagined 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.120
 on top of that we already know of apple 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.059
 is quite normal the macbook air and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 including then the accessories as it is so 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 say so wants to have in the packaging 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.070
 We then also the adapter for 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.649
 Power supply if you do not have such a long time 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 Cable needs to be directly behind it 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.580
 extension cable for the power supply firmly 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.040
 the outlet should be further away 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 should and of course the apple literature 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.030
 with the great apples you tick 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 now collects so much and otherwise 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 just as usual relatively little to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.580
 touch and now comes mine 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 Favorite recording then if you can do that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.560
 seal breaks like apple product 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 you have to take off the plastic that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.909
 then protects a bit in the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.920
 packaging but oh yes actually serves 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.259
 it's just that you have something left to do 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.770
 unpack it has as above it is yes 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.030
 padded and my first impression is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.049
 As always a nice device restes 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 maybe you will notice that a bit me 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.970
 I'm also a little upset about that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 product it is always newer 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 calculator 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.390
 It looks pretty awesome is ultra-thin 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.159
 and ultra light like an ultrabook in the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 Variation only ultra expensive 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.619
 on the right side we have once 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.979
 a sdk in slot after a usb 2.0 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.829
 3.0 port and of course a panda port 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.170
 Connection for thunderbolt devices and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.390
 other displays are also available 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.830
 adapter that one on 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.510
 for example full hd monitors 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.120
 can connect on the right side 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.190
 two microphones for noise reduction 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.190
 combined audio ports for microphone 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.540
 and headphones again a usb 2.0 3.0 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.590
 connection and the magsafe 2 connection 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.050
 that was it again for this one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340
 unboxing picard to unboxing of apple 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.070
 Do not say products because there is not much 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.110
 But there's something else on the way 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.310
 give if you should be a student then 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.620
 every time you have to do this 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.680
 Students take advantage of the discount 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.370
 helped me a lot in any case the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.140
 to do 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.550
 By the way, the video is completely on the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.280
 macbook air want to cut that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.110
 only me a little bit now 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.340
 did not bother but it was a 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.830
 The little one is not that weird 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.920
 display if so imac from the 27 inch 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.959
 changes but I know it worked 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.130
 and how it looks with the edges of time 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.780
 I see now I do not have it yet 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.950
 Talked because I'm working on that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.330
 as soon as I record this 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 but I think it will be on everyone 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.280
 fall longer than the imac but 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.260
 will still be in a justifiable 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.769
 be length because it has one too 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.030
 turbo boost up to 3.3ghz then thank you 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.500
 I look for me as always 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.870
 Hope you liked the video 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.370
 then we 'll see myself in the next video 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.170
 I hope I can do it more regularly now 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.180
 again to load videos so it's just 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.100
 all in a while at the moment 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.209
 difficult as I said we'll see you in the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.209
 next video until then
