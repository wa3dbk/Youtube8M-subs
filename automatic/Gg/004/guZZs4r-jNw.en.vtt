a total desert it's dry as a bone had a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.660 
a total desert it's dry as a bone had a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
flood of planetary proportion they look

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.690 
flood of planetary proportion they look
at<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> planet<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.869> 14

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
at a planet here that's only 14

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.520 
at a planet here that's only 14
the<00:01:22.850> rest<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.210> two<00:01:23.360> miles<00:01:23.570> deep<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:23.960> water<00:01:24.140> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the rest is two miles deep in water and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.590 
the rest is two miles deep in water and
they<00:01:24.590> make<00:01:24.890> fun<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.100> me<00:01:25.369> for<00:01:25.640> saying<00:01:26.119> we<00:01:26.360> once

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
they make fun of me for saying we once

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.270 
they make fun of me for saying we once
have<00:01:26.810> blood<00:01:27.079> we've<00:01:27.259> looked<00:01:27.439> like<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:27.890> just<00:01:28.100> got

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
have blood we've looked like we just got

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.940 
have blood we've looked like we just got
over<00:01:28.579> a<00:01:28.640> flood<00:01:28.909> right<00:01:29.570> now<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.409> Mars<00:01:30.740> is

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
over a flood right now now Mars is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.830 
over a flood right now now Mars is
gratis<00:01:31.219> and<00:01:31.579> we<00:01:31.670> point<00:01:31.939> three<00:01:32.240> eight<00:01:32.450> bars

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
gratis and we point three eight bars

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.830 
gratis and we point three eight bars
that's<00:01:33.530> why<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:33.950> can't<00:01:34.340> hold<00:01:34.700> an<00:01:35.000> atmospheric

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
that's why you can't hold an atmospheric

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.779 
that's why you can't hold an atmospheric
atmospheres<00:01:36.500> only<00:01:36.740> one<00:01:36.920> one-hundredth<00:01:37.610> is

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
atmospheres only one one-hundredth is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.770 
atmospheres only one one-hundredth is
thick<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:38.450> ours<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.789> everyone<00:01:40.789> is<00:01:41.119> he<00:01:41.360> that

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
thick as ours and so everyone is he that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.300 
thick as ours and so everyone is he that
explain<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.560> would<00:01:42.679> explain<00:01:43.039> why<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
explain one it would explain why the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.039 
explain one it would explain why the
water<00:01:43.579> is<00:01:43.700> not<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.569> believe<00:01:44.899> there

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
water is not there and I believe there

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.959 
water is not there and I believe there
was<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.200> flood<00:01:45.409> on<00:01:45.619> Mars<00:01:45.920> we've<00:01:46.369> got<00:01:46.579> evidence

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
was a flood on Mars we've got evidence

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.539 
was a flood on Mars we've got evidence
we<00:01:47.420> should<00:01:47.600> have<00:01:47.719> rivers<00:01:48.110> valleys<00:01:48.549> beaches

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
we should have rivers valleys beaches

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.029 
we should have rivers valleys beaches
and<00:01:49.759> oceans<00:01:50.210> that's<00:01:50.929> all<00:01:51.110> drives<00:01:51.500> bum<00:01:51.770> right

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
and oceans that's all drives bum right

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.210 
and oceans that's all drives bum right
now<00:01:52.250> canyons<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.210> everything<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:53.929> Delta<00:01:54.740> but

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
now canyons and everything and Delta but

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.789 
now canyons and everything and Delta but
it<00:01:55.369> all<00:01:55.849> learners<00:01:56.209> gone<00:01:56.479> now<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:56.929> we<00:01:57.409> say

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
it all learners gone now but we say

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.949 
it all learners gone now but we say
things<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:58.849> these<00:01:59.119> kinds<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.569> giant

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
things like these kinds of giant

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.169 
things like these kinds of giant
formations<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.679> form<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.369> only<00:02:01.640> thousands<00:02:02.119> of

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
formations can form in only thousands of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.330 
formations can form in only thousands of
years<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.689> they<00:02:03.259> made<00:02:03.409> fun<00:02:03.649> of<00:02:03.679> us<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.069> that

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
years and they made fun of us for that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.249 
years and they made fun of us for that
say<00:02:04.549> mmm<00:02:04.819> but<00:02:05.149> they<00:02:05.240> believe<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.599> happened<00:02:05.780> in

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
say mmm but they believe it happened in

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.499 
say mmm but they believe it happened in
a<00:02:06.319> matter<00:02:06.439> of<00:02:06.679> hundreds<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.670> years<00:02:07.880> for<00:02:08.179> weeks

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
a matter of hundreds of years for weeks

a matter of hundreds of years for weeks
on<00:02:08.720> Mars<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.890> see<00:02:10.099> this<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.429> not<00:02:10.459> let<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.060> left

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
on Mars you see this is not let the left

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.630 
on Mars you see this is not let the left
the<00:02:12.440> left<00:02:12.470> hemisphere<00:02:12.829> know<00:02:13.280> about<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.489> right

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the left hemisphere know about the right

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.910 
the left hemisphere know about the right
hemisphere<00:02:13.819> is<00:02:14.180> thinking<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:15.170> upsets<00:02:15.709> me

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
hemisphere is thinking this upsets me

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.569 
hemisphere is thinking this upsets me
because<00:02:16.400> that's<00:02:16.970> disingenuous<00:02:17.620> now<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.400> then

because that's disingenuous now and then

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.949 
because that's disingenuous now and then
then<00:02:19.819> I'll<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.150> someone<00:02:20.329> just<00:02:20.569> want<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.900> be

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959
