00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.739
 the beach 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.329
 I just heard the place number two so the share to reasonable 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.849
 be like 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.359
 at least it is the number one thing I have heard but for the rest 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.840
 go but also view summer immediately 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 maybe that's not me the woods i don't 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.110
 good day people the article 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.450
 the 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.490
 Day 3 of the arctic challenge 30 teams left from 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.880
 lights ahead towards the north cape to complete a journey of seven thousand kilometers 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.570
 to put the teams on the basis of the coordinates the honor given to it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.050
 tried to ride a fence 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.900
 we are already well on the way everyone is driving the last 800 kilometers in the direction 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.200
 the North Cape but then suddenly the credo is man 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 our camera team is dragged off the road by the slippery road and it is in the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.020
 roadside 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.440
 during the slip action they brought different trees and the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.120
 cameraman has problems with his back 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 the teams behind the camera team stopped at 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.250
 yes there we will use 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.990
 9 everything is arranged 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.380
 one can also see the ramparts 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.400
 he is for further interrogation 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.210
 and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.160
 that's right 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 both cars waiting 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.870
 good ones come 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.280
 richly decorated with flowers if you think by the minute the 5 th mail 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 it is to be expected 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.779
 but on 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.340
 have taken the first precautions 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.340
 the other teams can 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.579
 however, all expect to run 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.579
 or without a memo the stock markets in the min 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.179
 Then that will now include the ability to get you out among other things 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.309
 the other country has arrived and the boys are super satisfied 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.309
 taken for an examination to the hospital 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.599
 everyone must continue their journey to the last coordinates towards it 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.859
 north the teams are at least ten hours away in the beautiful landscape 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.859
 from norway 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.129
 it goes well 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.409
 I am very impressed with everything and what they encounter and see that happening 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.769
 8 well in the first stand cia the car was on the roadside which I really like 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.759
 shocked, I am very honest 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.859
 dare yesterday opal but this time there was wounded and I do notice that 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.549
 has an impact on me 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.680
 and when you give milk, you close that you drive on and yes it can be a very boring one 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.810
 stage against which the road matters and old you also have what I never got from the trip 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.409
 m yes acknowledges crazy think is that all teams we would actually interact with each other 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.179
 are now trying to catch the ferry 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:45.429
 and it's just more fun to get beers, it's fun and that is 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.529
 yes that makes me a bit behind the weather accident 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.469
 happened but it is intense 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.199
 estimates those years 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.199
 yes, we have now been helped wrong 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.829
 worried about 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.829
 ferries conditions 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.049
 how did that start yes often 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.499
 agents were under natural violence you go down and the rest goes to 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:09.239
 above 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.999
 also that is not how good it is every time 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.939
 it is also tomtom we must excel more and larger breasts I do 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.989
 style up 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.940
 tears were kept open i am ready to have you were also very smooth 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.949
 have also been warned this morning 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.009
 it is also sometimes the crying of the city perhaps the discharge of 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.529
 everything woke up a bit late 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.369
 but with the conclusions of the whole trip that I am really a trend so far 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:36.529
 the best thing I have experienced 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.589
 the ferry is coming to make the crossings to the other side but that 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.630
 then 15 editions 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.009
 certainly excellent for the actual 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.689
 apparently has much more experience in the long saying later less slippery 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.319
 Roads I walked in less board the roads so he tore into everything again 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.100
 Yeah so 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.199
 for that matter the money became good 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.469
 6 very impressive 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.979
 And above all, all our cameras are not there again just for it 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.999
 should stop to take a nice picture 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.039
 of course with the author open because otherwise the buyer can just land a country 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.189
 to grasp the ethernet stick it so when losing your own work what that 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.400
 concerns 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.009
 really a very nice experience really beautiful twitter it's like being in 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.069
 the overloonse on time occasionally 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.430
 we all thought we were doing very well, but he must see you 

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:35.229
 Certain things we have forgotten our friend's arrival yesterday 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.779
 departure times on board the new and the old counts towards the debate 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.820
 I didn't do that maybe so what you hear is October 8 because you just 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.749
 wrong comes the domain 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:49.050
 taken their own hand 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.120
 that mistake that we have repaired today is more entering the accident 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.719
 photo pr Wolput injured 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.819
 now goes meanwhile nowadays have a snowmobile the unions go 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.020
 we don't 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.439
 how you should go try again 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.319
 tomorrow the teams have arrived in the high north 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.749
 and more and more scooter on the program 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:09.189
