00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.340 
this way I remember my very first like
song<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> had<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> girl<00:00:56.930> was<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.320> on

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
song that I had with a girl was down on

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.010 
song that I had with a girl was down on
bended<00:00:58.829> knee<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.550> seventh<00:00:59.940> grade<00:01:00.020> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
bended knee I was in seventh grade and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
bended knee I was in seventh grade and
if<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.649> been<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.340> bended<00:01:02.850> knee<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.149> that

if I had been on bended knee at that
point<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.530> been<00:01:04.739> hugging<00:01:04.979> her<00:01:05.250> knee
