really cool item cold wand blow and
three<00:00:12.150> additional<00:00:12.450> explosive<00:00:12.870> blast

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
three additional explosive blast

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169

occurred after has kept sting explosive
blast<00:00:15.740> um<00:00:17.240> I<00:00:18.529> like<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> lot<00:00:19.710> ah<00:00:21.560> I'd<00:00:22.560> never

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
blast um I like it a lot ah I'd never

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
blast um I like it a lot ah I'd never
had<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.340> used<00:00:23.490> explosive<00:00:23.910> blast<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.140> I'm

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
had really used explosive blast so I'm

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.029 
had really used explosive blast so I'm
going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:26.099> show<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:27.090> without<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.510> ground

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
going to first show it without or ground

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.810 
going to first show it without or ground
just<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.550> basic<00:00:30.060> effect<00:00:30.920> but<00:00:31.920> uh<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.730> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
just for basic effect but uh what it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.690 
just for basic effect but uh what it
does<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.469> cast<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.860> once<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
does so I just cast it once and it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.319 
does so I just cast it once and it
exploded<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.739> did<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.890> accept<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.300> uh

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
exploded I did not accept that so uh

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
exploded I did not accept that so uh
never<00:00:40.079> mind<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> chain

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
never mind that's with the chain

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
never mind that's with the chain
reaction<00:00:41.879> extreme<00:00:42.660> still<00:00:43.020> since<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.469> didn't

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
reaction extreme still since I didn't

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.119 
reaction extreme still since I didn't
accept<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.910> uh<00:00:45.410> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> why<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.800> really

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
accept but uh this is why it's really

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.880 
accept but uh this is why it's really
awesome<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.770> chain<00:00:49.770> reaction<00:00:50.219> rim<00:00:51.890> by

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
awesome it's the chain reaction rim by

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.630 
awesome it's the chain reaction rim by
the<00:00:52.949> time<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> explosions<00:00:54.199> stop<00:00:55.640> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the time the explosions stop the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
the time the explosions stop the
cooldown<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.059> already<00:00:57.629> done<00:00:58.520> off<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> just

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
cooldown is already done off so you just

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.830 
cooldown is already done off so you just
become<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.629> exploding<00:01:03.629> exploding<00:01:04.320> base<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.580> um

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
become a exploding exploding base but um

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
become a exploding exploding base but um
without<00:01:06.840> any<00:01:07.080> room<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.369> does<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:11.420> for

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
without any room it just does as for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.219 
without any room it just does as for
explosions<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:14.330> do<00:01:15.330> more<00:01:15.479> fun<00:01:15.869> things<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
explosions and do more fun things like

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:33.910 
explosions and do more fun things like
at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:16.890> bombs<00:01:28.130> go<00:01:29.130> down<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.070> short<00:01:32.369> fuse

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
at the time bombs go down the short fuse

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.010 
at the time bombs go down the short fuse
it's<00:01:34.920> gonna<00:01:35.810> look<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:40.340> with

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's gonna look like that with

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.289 
it's gonna look like that with
obliterate<00:01:44.720> looks<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:50.549> my

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
obliterate looks like this and my

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.490 
obliterate looks like this and my
favorite<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.170> course<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.460> chain<00:01:53.820> reaction

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
favorite of course is chain reaction

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.429 
favorite of course is chain reaction
ends<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.590> being<00:01:58.130> 1212<00:01:59.130> explosions<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.439> is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
ends up being 1212 explosions and is

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.200 
ends up being 1212 explosions and is
just<00:02:01.770> hilarious<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:04.549> amount<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.640> damage<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
just hilarious the amount of damage is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.700 
just hilarious the amount of damage is
just<00:02:06.770> absolutely<00:02:08.660> like

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
cast explosion I want them to cast the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.620 
cast explosion I want them to cast the
exploding<00:02:30.930> blast<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:35.510> how<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630

exploding blast to see if the how it
looks<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:36.960> them<00:02:37.140> yeah<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> normal

looks with them yeah it just as a normal

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.490 
looks with them yeah it just as a normal
exploding<00:02:39.240> blast<00:02:39.480> without<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.900> your<00:02:40.050> room<00:02:40.260> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
exploding blast without in your room and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.850 
exploding blast without in your room and
without<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.980> wand<00:02:41.190> effect<00:02:42.590> one<00:02:43.590> over<00:02:43.770> there

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
without the wand effect one over there

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.690 
without the wand effect one over there
did<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.270> missed<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:47.340> only<00:02:47.460> works

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
did it if you missed it so it only works

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
did it if you missed it so it only works
for<00:02:47.820> for<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:49.070> but<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> effect<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:51.950> pretty

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
for for you but the effect is pretty

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.500 
for for you but the effect is pretty
pretty<00:02:53.520> friggin<00:02:54.120> funny<00:02:56.180> alligator<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.420> no

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
pretty friggin funny alligator for no

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.650 
pretty friggin funny alligator for no
other<00:02:57.630> reason<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.660> huge

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
other reason that is just the huge

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.470 
other reason that is just the huge
amount<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.960> explosions<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.860> happen<00:03:02.480> it's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
amount of explosions that happen it's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.120 
amount of explosions that happen it's
just<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.050> funny<00:03:09.050> but<00:03:10.050> yeah<00:03:10.290> that's<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> Wonder

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
just so funny but yeah that's the Wonder

just so funny but yeah that's the Wonder
