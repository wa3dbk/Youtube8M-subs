there's<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.240> couple<00:00:06.390> different<00:00:06.480> kinds<00:00:06.750> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
there's a couple different kinds of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.080 
there's a couple different kinds of
lenses<00:00:08.130> out<00:00:08.250> there<00:00:08.540> the<00:00:09.540> two<00:00:09.830> specific

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
lenses out there the two specific

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.600 
lenses out there the two specific
distinctions<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.389> zoom<00:00:13.290> lenses<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.830> prime

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
distinctions are zoom lenses and prime

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.250 
distinctions are zoom lenses and prime
lenses<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.599> difference<00:00:15.900> between<00:00:16.020> them

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
lenses and the difference between them

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.859 
lenses and the difference between them
is<00:00:16.289> really<00:00:16.529> simple<00:00:16.980> prime<00:00:17.820> lens<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.330> one

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
is really simple prime lens is just one

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.710 
is really simple prime lens is just one
focal<00:00:19.560> length<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.730> lenses<00:00:21.180> case<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
focal length in this lenses case this is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.890 
focal length in this lenses case this is
an<00:00:21.840> 85<00:00:22.320> millimeter<00:00:23.029> portrait<00:00:24.029> lens<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
an 85 millimeter portrait lens this is a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.439 
an 85 millimeter portrait lens this is a
zoom<00:00:25.140> lens<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:26.160> focal<00:00:26.250> length<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.849> 70<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
zoom lens and it's focal length is 70 to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.169 
zoom lens and it's focal length is 70 to
200<00:00:27.630> within<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.769> lens<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> same<00:00:29.760> focal

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
200 within this lens is the same focal

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.479 
200 within this lens is the same focal
length<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:31.019> lens<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.070> why<00:00:32.219> would<00:00:32.369> you

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
length as this lens so why would you

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.130 
length as this lens so why would you
ever<00:00:32.669> use<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.180> lens<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> could<00:00:33.960> use

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
ever use this lens when you could use

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
ever use this lens when you could use
this<00:00:34.320> lens<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.250> answer<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.610> pretty

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this lens and the answer is pretty

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.780 
this lens and the answer is pretty
simple<00:00:37.010> it's<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.309> matter<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> preference

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
simple it's just a matter of preference

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
simple it's just a matter of preference
this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> obviously<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> much<00:00:40.110> bigger<00:00:40.350> lens

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this is obviously a much bigger lens

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.400 
this is obviously a much bigger lens
much<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> carry<00:00:41.700> around<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> lot

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
much more to carry around this is a lot

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
much more to carry around this is a lot
more<00:00:43.559> small<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.040> compact<00:00:44.430> now<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> lot<00:00:45.450> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
more small and compact now a lot of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.479 
more small and compact now a lot of
professional<00:00:46.110> photographers<00:00:46.680> actually

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
professional photographers actually

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.660 
professional photographers actually
choose<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.570> prime<00:00:49.500> lenses<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> couple

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
choose to use prime lenses for a couple

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.410 
choose to use prime lenses for a couple
of<00:00:50.730> different<00:00:51.000> reasons

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
of different reasons

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
of different reasons
one<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.710> focal<00:00:53.160> length<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
one it's just one focal length that you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
one it's just one focal length that you
kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:53.969> accustomed<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.530> become

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
kind of get accustomed to you become

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
kind of get accustomed to you become
really<00:00:56.010> comfortable<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.690> another

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
really comfortable with but another

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.619 
really comfortable with but another
reason<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.980> prime<00:00:59.640> lenses<00:01:00.000> tend<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
reason is that prime lenses tend to be a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.290 
reason is that prime lenses tend to be a
lot<00:01:00.870> sharper<00:01:01.230> than<00:01:01.949> zooming<00:01:02.370> lenses<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
lot sharper than zooming lenses and that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
lot sharper than zooming lenses and that
reason<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.739> no<00:01:04.799> moving

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
reason is because there's no moving

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.190 
reason is because there's no moving
parts<00:01:05.250> other<00:01:05.700> than<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.119> focus<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
parts other than the focus so you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.030 
parts other than the focus so you can
get<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.830> glass<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.530> gives<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
get more glass and it just gives you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760 
get more glass and it just gives you
better<00:01:11.220> overall<00:01:11.610> image<00:01:11.939> quality<00:01:12.530> however<00:01:13.530> if

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
better overall image quality however if

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.560 
better overall image quality however if
I<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.040> shooting<00:01:14.189> something<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.970> say<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I was shooting something like say a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
I was shooting something like say a
basketball<00:01:16.140> game<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.310> wouldn't<00:01:17.610> be

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
basketball game this really wouldn't be

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
basketball game this really wouldn't be
a<00:01:17.759> very<00:01:17.970> good<00:01:18.090> option<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> bring

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

I like the focal lens 85 which is this
and<00:01:58.590> 24<00:01:59.070> millimeters<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.299> also<00:02:00.840> on

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and 24 millimeters but I do also on

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.160 
and 24 millimeters but I do also on

is<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.079> one<00:02:38.349> eight<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.769> will<00:02:38.859> do<00:02:38.950> better<00:02:39.099> in

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
is a one eight so this will do better in

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.550 
is a one eight so this will do better in
low<00:02:39.430> light<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.930> also<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.290> very<00:02:41.500> good

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
low light but this is also a very good

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.530 
low light but this is also a very good
lens<00:02:41.890> because<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.430> fix<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:43.000> eight<00:02:43.180> from

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
lens because it's a fix to eight from

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.089 
lens because it's a fix to eight from
seventy<00:02:44.139> all<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.560> way<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.709> two<00:02:44.920> hundred

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099

however<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.750> get<00:02:47.019> cheaper<00:02:47.470> lenses<00:02:47.650> or

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250

that<00:02:51.010> low<00:02:51.489> maximum<00:02:52.299> aperture<00:02:52.750> will<00:02:52.959> actually

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
that low maximum aperture will actually

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.890 
that low maximum aperture will actually
jump<00:02:53.769> up<00:02:54.010> as<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.549> zoom<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.629> it's<00:02:55.750> not

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
jump up as you zoom in so it's not

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.319 
jump up as you zoom in so it's not
uncommon<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.590> see<00:02:56.739> something<00:02:57.519> like<00:02:57.639> a<00:02:57.849> 70<00:02:58.239> to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
uncommon to see something like a 70 to

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.229 
uncommon to see something like a 70 to
200<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.980> instead<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.280> being<00:03:00.609> a<00:03:00.670> 72

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
200 like this that instead of being a 72

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.399 
200 like this that instead of being a 72
to<00:03:01.599> 200<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.620> 8<00:03:02.859> it'll<00:03:03.489> be<00:03:03.639> a<00:03:03.670> 70<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.420> 200<00:03:04.569> three

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
to 200 to 8 it'll be a 70 to 200 three

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.129 
to 200 to 8 it'll be a 70 to 200 three
five<00:03:05.620> five<00:03:06.430> six<00:03:06.790> which<00:03:07.239> physically<00:03:07.900> means

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
five five six which physically means

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.289 
five five six which physically means
that<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.709> maximum<00:03:08.920> aperture<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.760> getting

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
that that maximum aperture is getting

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.750 
that that maximum aperture is getting
smaller<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:10.810> smaller<00:03:11.079> as<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.439> zoom<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.889> not

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
smaller and smaller as you zoom in not

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670 
smaller and smaller as you zoom in not
super<00:03:13.180> great<00:03:13.299> for<00:03:13.599> low-light<00:03:13.750> for<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
super great for low-light for that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.129 
super great for low-light for that
reason<00:03:15.069> zoom<00:03:15.970> lenses<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.449> be<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.599> lot<00:03:16.900> more

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
reason zoom lenses can be a lot more

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.349 
reason zoom lenses can be a lot more
expensive<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.949> do<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> lot<00:03:18.609> worse<00:03:18.970> in

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
expensive and do a lot worse in

expensive and do a lot worse in
low-light<00:03:19.900> situations<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:21.609> also<00:03:21.819> you<00:03:21.970> got

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
low-light situations it's also you got

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.280 
low-light situations it's also you got
to<00:03:22.180> keep<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.449> mind<00:03:22.629> there's<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.900> lot<00:03:23.109> more

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
to keep in mind there's a lot more

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.619 
to keep in mind there's a lot more

all lens like this because there's

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.879 
all lens like this because there's
nothing<00:03:27.010> zooming<00:03:27.579> here<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.239> addition

most<00:03:29.889> prime<00:03:30.609> lenses<00:03:31.000> don't<00:03:31.359> have<00:03:31.889> things<00:03:32.889> like

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
most prime lenses don't have things like

most prime lenses don't have things like
image<00:03:33.489> stabilization<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:35.169> you'll<00:03:35.290> find

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
image stabilization that you'll find

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.009 
image stabilization that you'll find
with<00:03:35.949> lenses<00:03:36.699> like<00:03:36.849> this<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.900> is

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
with lenses like this this is
