00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 and good friends today I want to teach you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.710
 Cook 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.929
 tempura 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.570
 the temple to you can do it with 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:30.340
 any kind of vegetable can 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:35.239
 make with carrot and onion 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.839
 pumpkin with green pepper with what 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.329
 you want fungi too I in 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.570
 this case I will make tempura of this 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.570
 fungus 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.000
 and this is because where I work 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.160
 these are not mushrooms that we 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.920
 we do good at best if they do 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.260
 same but I do not or not aware no but 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.570
 well these mushrooms sell them there in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 inside the factory where I work and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.239
 they sell them very cheap then I 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 they sold a bag for 150 yen 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.030
 then this one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 I was thinking what to do what to do 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.050
 eating and good lady is there of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 my job they told me ah look is done is 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.400
 temporary you will be very rich and I 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 I said season then why today 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.940
 I want to teach them how to do good if 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 find this type of fungus do it 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.960
 they separate them so it's like that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.840
 so they do not separate so they wash it 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 good and good the ingredients are very 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.869
 easy going to be flour for tempura if 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 they have flour for tempura is fine and 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.580
 if they do not have it at hand they can 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.399
 do also with normal flour the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.289
 amount will depend on the amount of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.210
 tempura that you do I put 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.070
 little because then nothing else is for me 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.289
 for where masked and the cold water the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.110
 consistency should look like 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.270
 out flour for hot cakes more or less 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.950
 of this style and for them to have a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 crispy tempura 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.759
 how 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.039
 advice I tell them to put a little 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.010
 of sake or if they have tequila 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.230
 put it like that a little bit like that more or less 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.720
 that was advice I saw on TV and 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.079
 if it's true then we're going to prepare 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.110
 in the tempura mix so they can see 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.640
 we are gradually putting the water to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.599
 that also we are not going to make a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.819
 super diluted mixture dt as good if you 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.780
 it is a bit watery because they add a 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.780
 little more flour 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 they should also have a leaf with a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.099
 pan with oil I have this so that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 is exclusive for frying things if 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.650
 You have a skillet 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.750
 they can also do it and be that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.730
 the oil is hot and we are going to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.150
 prepare now if the season we're going 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.580
 to grab the fungus 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.640
 the bonds are already worthy I've decided 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.040
 they took off 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.500
 good try not to take off 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.800
 the mushrooms so that they are not 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.320
 this cooking is easier since 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.320
 it's like that we 're going to put in the oil 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.970
 in this test 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.330
 you are seeing as I go taking 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.110
 a medium color medium good coffee 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.850
 wait for the colors to be black and 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.850
 all that means that it is already 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.010
 to put it on you will be there or if 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.020
 you plan on getting the flour 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.780
 season is also worth 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.150
 and good reference of a recipient of 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.320
 these so that when the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.320
 temporary more 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.810
 peace and terror 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.810
 and right now that you others more 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.729
 and good friends as you know I do not 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.580
 I am a super cook and good everything 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.620
 what I do then good is the same and the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.550
 appearance is not very attractive but the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.569
 I is zero increase seen 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.169
 thomas calabro also calls gold and if 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.499
 you sow a final drink 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.939
 If they look prettier, I hope so 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:01.599
 according to me saying they subscribe that no 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.599
 they burn 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.430
 but good friend is delicious when 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.300
 they can accompany it by putting it on 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.590
 a little soy and it tastes really good 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.590
 I hope you make the recipe 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.970
 let's see for the next video
