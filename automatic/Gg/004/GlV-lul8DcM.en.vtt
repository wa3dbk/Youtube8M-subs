 iron ore and so on well we 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.050
 understood good good such hard workers 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 miners give steep ore resources 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.670
 the tools are shorter than superb though 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.390

 we have such a mill here they are here 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.980
 again hard workers 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.160
 these are noisy at least from ordinary 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.769
