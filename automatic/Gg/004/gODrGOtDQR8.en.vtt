00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
there yeah I need to take out a flyer if

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:52.260 
there yeah I need to take out a flyer if
he<00:01:40.790> drops<00:01:41.090> one

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.149 

really<00:01:53.020> wish<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.289> could<00:01:53.320> make<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.590> draw<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.859> card

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
really wish I could make it draw a card

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.720 
really wish I could make it draw a card
what's<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.060> brew<00:01:55.210> warden

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.270 

okay<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:02.540> if<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:02.870> narcolepsy<00:02:03.380> let's<00:02:04.130> see

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
okay so if I narcolepsy let's see

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.260 
okay so if I narcolepsy let's see
because<00:02:04.370> he<00:02:04.490> has<00:02:04.580> four<00:02:04.790> guys<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.000> could

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
because he has four guys that could

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.350 
because he has four guys that could
swing<00:02:05.450> through<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.050> have<00:02:06.170> four<00:02:06.500> blockers<00:02:06.830> I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
swing through and I have four blockers I

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.670 
swing through and I have four blockers I
guess<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.450> could<00:02:08.570> set<00:02:08.720> up<00:02:08.810> advantageous<00:02:09.230> blocks

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
guess I could set up advantageous blocks

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:24.160 
guess I could set up advantageous blocks
then<00:02:16.060> beat<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.240> down<00:02:17.450> steadily<00:02:22.660> but<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.900> think

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
then beat them down steadily but I think

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.930 
then beat them down steadily but I think
the<00:02:24.290> last<00:02:24.440> beaters<00:02:24.950> he<00:02:25.100> has<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.520> case<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.760> draw

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the last beaters he has in case you draw

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.100 
the last beaters he has in case you draw
some<00:02:26.210> sort<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:27.250> make<00:02:28.250> my<00:02:28.400> guys<00:02:28.610> not<00:02:29.150> block<00:02:29.510> I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.360 

don't<00:02:33.110> think<00:02:33.170> green<00:02:33.470> red<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> way<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.100> deal

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
don't think green red as a way to deal

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.310 
don't think green red as a way to deal
with<00:02:34.430> either<00:02:34.820> any<00:02:35.270> flyers<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.900> need<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.140> worry

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
with either any flyers I need to worry

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.590 
with either any flyers I need to worry
about<00:02:42.460> things<00:02:43.460> if<00:02:43.670> you'd<00:02:43.790> wash<00:02:44.000> my<00:02:44.210> replays

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
about things if you'd wash my replays

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.300 
about things if you'd wash my replays
