00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.360
 but 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.260
 now student this video we are going to 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.300
 talk a little bit about the plants we have 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.279
 we will remember them better because I believe 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.090
 that you already know the parts of the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.700
 plants some of their classifications 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.760
 how they feed and how they reproduce 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.610
 It's worth as we remember a little bit the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.810
 parts of the plants 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 but I think you already know roots truth 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.520
 stalk the branches the flowers the leaves the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.450
 fruits all that are the parts of the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.059
 plants I think that by now 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.880
 I'm sure you know how to differentiate 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.830
 every part of a plant we will see 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.980
 how we can classify 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.170
 different plants 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.420
 a classification is according to the stem 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.600
 as the shroud as we can 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.940
 Divide into two or herbaceous parts 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.520
 that has the unitary delgadito and 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.390
 flexible or woody are those that 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.360
 they have the stem 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.229
 hard within the woody could be 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.729
 bush that are the branches that are born 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.000
 very close to the ground or trees in the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.210
 that the branches that come out of the stem 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.930
 in they do well above the ground 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.690
 in agreement bushes the branches come out of 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.680
 practically 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.170
 close to the ground and trees 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 the branches start to come out from 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.190
 well above 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.740
 those stages are big stems 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 robust shrines that we call trunk 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 in the case of trees 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.210
 we look to see that according to the sheets can 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.890
 be deciduous or evergreen 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.619
 the deciduous foods expire 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.230
 Some time passes here, therefore, to the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.870
 leaves a little the same happens 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.000
 When autumn arrives those leaves fall 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.060
 Well, if they fall, we'll say they're leaves 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.030
 Deciduous that if the autumn fall 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.129
 perennials last last all year not 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.380
 will never agree those are the 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.740
 perennials 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.330
 deciduous and perennial the classification of 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.330
 the plants according to their leaves 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.220
 how plants are fed we are going to 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.580
 see what I'm going to explain here you have a 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.739
 tiny little scheme we see below that from 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.020
 the earth 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.069
 water and salts are collected from the roots 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:55.510
 mineral salts minerals rise 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.380
 towards the leaves to that product what 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.750
 we call brute sap 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.420
 and it reaches the others and through the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.260
 sunlight and through the air of the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 components that at air level thanks to 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.300
 all these factors what they do is in 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.600
 the sheet convert that gross output that 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.000
 has gone up in elaborate sap that they carry 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.300
 nutrients and that elaborate sap what 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.250
 is is distributed throughout the plant 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.800
 to all the cells and those cells 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.260
 they receive the nutrients and they grow that way 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.340
 easy how plants feed 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.340
 how it develops 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.800
 and finally we will see the reproduction 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.520
 of the plants 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.790
 here we have all the elements that 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.130
 influence this reproduction we have the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.860
 tarot and the branch the chalice would be what 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.860
 subject all the flower set 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.400
 with the petals of what are the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.450
 petals true the petals that cover a 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.390
 system that is in the center of the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.459
 and that system we find the pistil that 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.500
 it's like a tiny little bottle has 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.319
 bottle shape that contains the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.610
 ovules and then with some filaments 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:14.100
 around the pistil that are stable and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.160
 that's maybe at the end of 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.250
 at the end of the filament contains 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.950
 sachets with pollen that happens that by 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.830
 wind or animals 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.860
 insects 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.740
 is the pollen gets into the 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.220
 pistil and he puts himself together with the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.220
 ovules 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.929
 In that union , a 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:41.119
 fruit is the fruit is growing inside 

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:43.399
 of the dress goes growing it goes growing 

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:45.480
 growing and that fruit when it is mature 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:50.030
 falls on the ground 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.030
 and if the right conditions are produced 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.770
 nutrients in the soil and temperature 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.160
 because the elimination occurs is the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.100
 fruit that has fallen to earth I say yes 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.140
 occurs in the ideal conditions it goes 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.720
 growing is growing and developing 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.300
 in a new plant develops its 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.970
 roots develops its branches develops 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.710
 its leaves develops its flowers and returns 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.050
 again to begin the process of 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.130
 reproduction 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.350
 another way that plants have 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.630
 reproduce is by means of cuttings 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.380
 Well, it's your tournament's two 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.140
 where the branches that can be planted 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.230
 also in the leg and have the 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.530
 ability to reproduce or generate 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.330
 again roots and again branches and other 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.650
 once flowers of agreement is a way of 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.370
 reproduce on plants by means of 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.280
 skeletal 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.560
 well, it has been easy, really, in a 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.830
 easy enough topic I leave you all 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.930
 Forms a scheme, take a look 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.630
 quietly 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.419
 because I know there are many many 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.370
 content but I think they are pretty 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.620
 easy and for the moment in this course with 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.819
 that stops and if these things I think 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:14.310
 that is good 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:14.310
 in the next video a greeting
