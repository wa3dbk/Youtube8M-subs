00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
waiting for it to generate but that's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.560 
waiting for it to generate but that's
pretty<00:00:39.380> awesome<00:00:39.500> i<00:00:39.920> definitely<00:00:40.280> like<00:00:40.399> that<00:00:40.640> so

generates<00:00:43.280> faster<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:44.870> going<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.079> be<00:00:45.170> a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200
