00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.989
 but not after the summer holidays and incorrect 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.709
 today i'm ready to show has seen that i pretty much 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.480
 the nice thing is the number of suspects arrested 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.899
 but also when you assume that you are leaving and not possessing her special 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.899
 you can use astana, you make it in particular 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.010
 step in and start taking the club 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.960
 thereby were by approximately 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.330
 in the middle of getting used to 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.670
 v shape 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400
 backside on the crown 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.590
 on both sides 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.890
 and that will be soon 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.660
 Seeing as the tradeoff makes it sometimes handy 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.550
 point where you want to go with your finger 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.260
 at the crown parties and then contrary to the point can pull then you know 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.980
 always that you are heading in the right direction 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.760
 step 2 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.790
 there are 8 parts of the parties that come together in one tail 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.810
 who said parties you want to finish 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.370
 because you can 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.930
 40 out of cap 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 yes it is also recommended at the cockpit 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.900
 who do you want to finish 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.970
 to do that yourself and on the other hand ensures that it takes time to do this 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.150
 good to get tight so you do not bother her 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
 and see a hole to show how 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 4 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 step 3 is dividing woerth 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.960
 in the above parties 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.950
 the town are still in it 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.740
 and from Tuesday about 8 fuel cells the size of the endgame 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.530
 to process in the top half of the hair 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.869
 thereby firmly he had to leave 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.320
 Mainly at the start of the tub, volume has to keep working 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.230
 we are also having a good time with the busty lady 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.509
 financial funds were already a good start for auctioned 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 and now we will choose to shape the tub 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.869
 what we are going to do in the middle of the horse 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.679
 after the tub has been shaped go to fix it 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.779
 at the back on the tail that the mother afternoon of 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.459
 and I'm stitches 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.650
 these stones were not visible what are we going to do on the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.459
 fix the side to the tail 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.629
 if there is well done to the ceremony separately 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.540
 because it must keep feeling a bit loose 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.299
 makes sure you use your fingers 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.250
 a little 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.809
 loosely naive 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.149
 and the why that solid to indicate it is important that you just 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.939
 after speaks with a little hang 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.889
 now the final steps are coming out 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.589
 actually making the start at the bottom of the neck 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:55.019
 To give extras under the hammer, it is advisable to use asare 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.629
 I think this has done very well it is to give an iron bar a chance
