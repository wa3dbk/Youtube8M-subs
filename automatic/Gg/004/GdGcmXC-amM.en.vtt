00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.429 
back this is a tone interruption a kill
switch<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.490> causes<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.210> 60<00:02:06.630> cycle<00:02:06.810> hum<00:02:07.079> so

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
switch and this causes a 60 cycle hum so

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.109 
switch and this causes a 60 cycle hum so
the<00:02:07.590> idea<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.160> guitar<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.879> deal<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the idea of this guitar was to deal with

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.750 
the idea of this guitar was to deal with
all<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> archaic<00:02:10.379> noises<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> had<00:02:11.520> with

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
all the archaic noises that you had with

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.510 
all the archaic noises that you had with
broken<00:02:12.030> Peterson<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.770> old<00:02:13.920> years<00:02:14.220> when

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
broken Peterson in the old years when

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.610 
broken Peterson in the old years when
each<00:02:14.879> our<00:02:15.090> manufacturing<00:02:15.690> was<00:02:15.870> insufficient

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
each our manufacturing was insufficient

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.650 
each our manufacturing was insufficient
or<00:02:16.800> when<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.520> guitar<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:18.000> old<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.420> some

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
or when the guitar was old and some

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.630 
or when the guitar was old and some
damages<00:02:19.140> went<00:02:19.349> on<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.709> players<00:02:20.040> started<00:02:20.520> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
damages went on so players started to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.760 
damages went on so players started to
deal<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:21.180> noises<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.840> what<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.379> wanted

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
deal with these noises and what I wanted

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.020 
deal with these noises and what I wanted
to<00:02:22.860> do<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.340> create

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
to do is to create

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.090 
to do is to create
the<00:02:24.330> perfect<00:02:24.810> guitar<00:02:25.140> which<00:02:25.440> deals<00:02:25.770> with

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
the perfect guitar which deals with

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.860 
the perfect guitar which deals with
these<00:02:26.520> noises<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.150> find<00:02:27.420> them<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.780> in

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
these noises and you find them here in

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.020 
these noises and you find them here in
the<00:02:27.960> line<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> volume<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.790> tone

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the line so this is a volume and tone

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.810 
the line so this is a volume and tone
that's<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.750> about<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> Tesla<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.640> new

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
that's all about the Tesla and the new

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.560 
that's all about the Tesla and the new
one<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.330> more<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.790> have<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.180> approach<00:02:36.540> of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
one is more you can have the approach of

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.170 
one is more you can have the approach of
saying<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.440> more<00:02:37.980> stylistic<00:02:38.460> instrument

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180

amongst all of my guitars this seems to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.180 
amongst all of my guitars this seems to
be<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.210> most<00:02:42.630> traditional<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:44.010> call

be the most traditional if you can call

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.530 
be the most traditional if you can call
it<00:02:44.340> traditional<00:02:44.520> because<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.180> got<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> hit

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540

pickup<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.370> show<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.300> how<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.960> looks<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
pickup I show you how it looks on the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.400 
pickup I show you how it looks on the
back<00:03:22.500> side<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:24.270> see<00:03:24.770> that<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.610> very

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
back side you see that it's a very

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.160 
back side you see that it's a very
three-dimensional<00:03:28.410> body<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:29.780> carved<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
shaped in a very let's say spectacular

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.990 
shaped in a very let's say spectacular
way<00:03:36.260> how<00:03:37.260> does<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.500> shape<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.520> affect

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
way how does a shape like this affect

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.170 
way how does a shape like this affect
the<00:03:39.090> tone<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.480> guitar<00:03:40.580> well<00:03:41.580> there<00:03:42.090> are

the tone of the guitar well there are

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.449 
the tone of the guitar well there are
some<00:03:42.450> basic<00:03:43.020> needs<00:03:43.320> for<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.680> shape<00:03:44.070> for<00:03:45.380> being

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
some basic needs for a shape for being

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.210 
some basic needs for a shape for being
able<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.670> get<00:03:48.270> out<00:03:48.500> bass<00:03:49.500> response<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
instrument but I would say that three
