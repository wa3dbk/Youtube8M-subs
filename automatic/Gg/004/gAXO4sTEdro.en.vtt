do is a little bit different and with

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.200 
do is a little bit different and with
the<00:00:27.060> character<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.849> draw<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:29.880> from<00:00:30.090> your

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210

mind or something you see but it's not

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.160 
mind or something you see but it's not
realistic<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.719> kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
realistic it's just kind of like a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.930 
realistic it's just kind of like a
cartoon<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.280> forth<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.290> started

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
cartoon and so forth so to get started

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.340 
cartoon and so forth so to get started
what<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.050> practice<00:00:40.350> drawing

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
what you can do is just practice drawing

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.959 
what you can do is just practice drawing
anything<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> want<00:00:43.649> basically<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> make<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
anything you want basically and make it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.600 
anything you want basically and make it
into<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> character<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:47.010> usually<00:00:47.370> start

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
into a character so I usually start

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.660 
into a character so I usually start
practicing<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.629> eyes<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.500> I'll<00:00:50.250> usually

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
practicing with eyes and I'll usually

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.330 
practicing with eyes and I'll usually
come<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:52.379> draw<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> big<00:00:52.829> eye<00:00:53.010> like

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
here give it a big eyebrow and do the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.560 
here give it a big eyebrow and do the
eyelid<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.789> may<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.870> true<00:01:01.079> P<00:01:01.260> eye

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570

eyelid and this may be the true P eye
here<00:01:04.400> okay<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.970> usually<00:01:06.450> I'll<00:01:06.570> come<00:01:06.840> down

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
here okay and so usually I'll come down

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.450 
here okay and so usually I'll come down
and<00:01:07.439> maybe<00:01:08.220> he<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:09.090> long<00:01:09.360> nose<00:01:10.460> and

and maybe he has a really long nose and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
and maybe he has a really long nose and
then<00:01:11.640> I'll<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.210> ball<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
then I'll just do a little ball for the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
then I'll just do a little ball for the
nose<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.460> maybe<00:01:14.610> he's<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
