00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.970
 in the elevator a goal I will turn are 11 goals 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.420
 in ball where the customer arrived with noise 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.440
 strong in the wheel that we are in the part 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 front wheel car front wheel 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:27.300
 on the lift even though the rear 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 we have here rear wheel part of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.690
 brake pads rolling bearings 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 I was out dismantled everything but 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.030
 analyzing here the customer arrived with him 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.850
 wheel and saw that it is the bearing of the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.969
 wheel but doing an analysis by opening 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.579
 we see that everyone is here or all 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.980
 world including here 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:01.050
 the wheel cylinder trim is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 leaking to open trim here the turn the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 brake fluid when doing this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.390
 happens 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.460
 Look, when this happens, it's no use. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.000
 only do the expected service that the exchange 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.840
 of the wheel hub here when 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.250
 see that it's all together 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.579
 Everyone here's the garrison when you 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 opens the oil already the life of the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.540
 customer and already makes the exchange of cylinders 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.380
 brakes is a cheap but 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:47.329
 extreme safety for the vehicle because it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:51.829
 an insurance if he might burst 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:57.960
 fluid no longer has internal pressure 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:59.700
 us here in the brake pipes loses 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.329
 this pressure on the system 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.430
 the car is unbraked only with the brake 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.259
 hand 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.819
 but already with this unit here 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.560
 already with this unit 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.609
 on the tarpaulins is the hand brake is already 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.859
 disabled because of this when this 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.409
 happens and degree what we are going to do is 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:27.180
 the house passes the canvases of the 5th region in 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:31.409
 and pick up and measure here is the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.829
 wear this that canvas that was 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.799
 not much time wasted little time 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.730
 including we see that the wheel hub 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.430
 has also been changed since the game wear 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.629
 no wear and tear you should see 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:53.730
 What is a pot pan here is a pan? 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:58.349
 new maintenance was not done but the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 the bearing bearing did not support 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.750
 I do not know if they took the old bearing and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.290
 put in the new cube but the case is that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.269
 the snare roll that 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.419
 it was more critical on the other side 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.639
 He was also snoring but not so much but 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.819
 this most critical hand came down very me 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:26.220
 all canvas and we'll do we 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:32.220
 with the thermal blower so that the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:36.030
 evaporates from the contaminant 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:41.069
 canvas lima lima to leave the best 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:45.829
 possible for what can travel with 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:49.259
 this car in highway public highway 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:54.959
 make the change tomorrow as best as possible 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:58.169
 then this gets the alert will make a 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.599
 maintenance for the repair of a 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.609
 here in this case the bearing but 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.229
 see what needs to do more 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:11.290
 customer and aggregates services and 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:14.469
 do a good service here the customer 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.780
 advised us or allowed us to make 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.600
 maintenance you need then 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.960
 What we 're going to do here is the wheel. 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.270
 the right rear hub and here passing 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.720
 on the other hand here we have the cube 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.160
 left side bring here to see that no 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.120
 has no contaminants is just dirty 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.850
 dirt and soot of the zone 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.320
 now I'm going to do the cleaning and those 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.910
 cylinder on the other side let's change 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.020
 due to leakage 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.750
 this is one more a tip plus one a 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.400
 video comment in my position is for 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.400
 you and until the next
