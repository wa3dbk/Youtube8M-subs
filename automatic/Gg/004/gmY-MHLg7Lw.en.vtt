00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.350
 Mexican selection you know has been a 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.540
 constant theme since he lost in the 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.879
 Aztec and all this chepo change of the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.570
 benito manuel vucetich tower well 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.760
 this week has not been the absence of 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.279
 information yesterday selection to jonathan 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.990
 Orozco, goalkeeper of Monterrey, had a 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.359
 problem in the left shoulder today is 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.460
 he knows it's not that bad so the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.769
 Saturday he could play with his club without 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.170
 However, he broke ranks with the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.660
 selection and today another bad news angel 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.080
 Reyna midfielder of the selection and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.150
 of the veracruz in which they are sown 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.940
 so much hope because it also 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.820
 injured today it turns out that when trying a 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.950
 Chilean in training falls badly and you 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.010
 I read exactly what it has is 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.320
 a medial ligament capsule rupture 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.290
 so it causes low selection 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 national then this is already 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.550
 notified the veracruz club 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 then take action on the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.830
 It is not known whether it is so serious or 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.479
 is to have the box that you have is that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 is that I am very worried about the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 game of October 11th really not 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.500
 I mean, I know it's me and 50 million 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.510
 Mexicans and like things 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 just with all these injured and 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.830
 We all worry we are worried but 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.020
 well clear your health too and things from 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.190
 those as the party I'm very busy 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.260
 but I tell you 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.310
 it is unknown then the seriousness and in 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.320
 as to especially the time of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.149
 recovery is not known I insist it is a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.880
 medial ligament capsule rupture 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.619
 it sounds like a very serious truth but tomorrow 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 surely they will make known the veracruz 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.790
 how much time it will take to heal that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.470
 however then the second descent 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.729
 of the Mexican national team but if you're 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.619
 very worried and people who also 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.440
 who sees us says what a barbarity with 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.300
 I do not have injuries that do not suffer the subject 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.610
 by carlos vela and guillermo ochoa with the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.910
 system selection is closed case today 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.870
 VÃ­ctor Manuel Vucetich says confirms that 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.940
 the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.740
 this against designing and I had the director 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.810
 of national teams after already 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.960
 He spoke with them and they both said that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.960
 we were going
