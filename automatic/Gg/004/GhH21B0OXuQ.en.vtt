00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:08.160
 my name is from there and I come to upload my 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.160
 first youtube video 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.170
 the turtle species that is a ball 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.760
 but also known as turtle 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.310
 soft shell 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.119
 well I will tell you some things this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.110
 turtle to start are 100% turtles 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.990
 Aquatic 100% means that never 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.610
 they will be on land more than to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.010
 deposit their eggs 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.680
 they are very aggressive turtles very very 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.060
 aggressive 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 and hence its name xerox 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.980
 of these turtles should be alone 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.699
 in your aquarium because they are very wild 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 very wild right now if you can do and 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.940
 how they saw followed by that neck so 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.699
 long that has 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.949
 when they are big it does not matter what 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.070
 place the grip shell will 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:06.310
 to fish and its painful crushing and believe me 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.979
 they are very territorial also these 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.260
 turtles are very susceptible to 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.630
 skin and fungal infections 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.780
 how to know if turtle has fungi good 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.680
 here below where has that little 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.540
 line of degree 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.850
 you will start to paint a color 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.460
 yellowish red 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.020
 that is the first sign to know that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.299
 your turtle has another good thing if this 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.940
 it's so that it has an aquarium and you 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.880
 turtle uses it has new niches 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.930
 you have to look for a treatment 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.409
 fungicide suitable for 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.060
 to heal your person 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.789
 the temperature at which that turtle 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.390
 It must be between 26 and 28 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.390
 degrees Celsius 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.170
 if you need logs to hide 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.840
 Y 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.970
 and a fairly considerable depth 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.360
 in your pond for 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.600
 because he likes to be buried or be 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.090
 that the substrate for a turtle 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.000
 you can have yes but as an ornament in this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.880
 turtle is essential that you have it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.069
 because this turtle needs it 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.349
 tends to bury 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.569
 and if it is not buried, it starts to 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.710
 stress and torture can die of 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.290
 stress 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.290
 this turtle is very delicate 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.730
 all the diseases that you think that 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 You can give him a turtle you can give him 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.470
 very easy up to three times easier 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.880
 this one needs a brackish water eye not 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.880
 brackish salty 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.890
 how to put the salt in the right water 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.080
 for that good turtle 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.360
 what you should do is for every liter of 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.170
 water obviously already declared are you going to 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.620
 put 60 grams of salt sea salt slab 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.620
 of table 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.940
 with this you will make good the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.280
 turtle is not going to have so much trouble with 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.500
 infections my colombia 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.660
 size of this turtle this turtle 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.510
 can get to measure carapace between 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.490
 40 and 45 centimeters so if you 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.270
 you buy one you know what they throw 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.720
 michaux the sexual dimorphism is 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.860
 Turtle does not have sexual dimorphism 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.470
 only when they are adults 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.970
 the female is bigger than the male 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.810
 but I would only know if you have a 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.580
 female and a male until they are adults 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.920
 feeding that turtle this turtle 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.560
 it is very carnivorous it also feeds 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.020
 pellet is obviously but should always 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.500
 have the option of catching fish 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:55.310
 crustacean mollusk fish in it 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.310
 in the terrarium and in the aquarium sorry 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.489
 it feeds more than anything 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.170
 of the fish that is very good at home 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.959
 swimmer very very good swimmer and very 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.590
 good hunter I do not recommend it as 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.569
 turtle for a first-timer since they are very 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.750
 delicate and very aggressive you need 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.370
 have a large space 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.450
 one thing that I can notice I do not know if it's 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.820
 true but the tip of the tail has 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.930
 there in your sewer 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 and excrete like a musk I do not know if it's 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.810
 Certain one that is can leave me 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.390

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.350

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.690
 help 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.300
 so do not leave when buried 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.210
