00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 naturally all such things are done with 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.550
 hood is done hood 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.270
 there is a mesh it is certainly not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.579
 know-how 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 normal things have it all that is 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.420
 you need to mask your face 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.490
 if you use tactical mushrooms 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.879
 how can i show my video to you 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.580
 mask and be sure when working with 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.860
 brass banks 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.489
 here we can wipe your head like someone like 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.239
 would it be more convenient for someone as you can 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.239
 blow through the net 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.939
 but for me personally, I always master the face 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.750
 I do not use meshes 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:08.790
 tactical 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:25.530
 fungus make-up coloring fighting Indian and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:29.700
 Well, and so the following nuances with which 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.590
 you may encounter this advantage in 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 that natural 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.140
 loyko she's perfect and camouflage 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.390
 means she in most cases 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.120
 fits into the landscape 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.310
 hunting for goose in the fields hunting in the reeds 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.070
 so late autumn and early spring 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.229
 when the reed is absolutely worth it but 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 this option we have someone that is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.720
 the disadvantage is that working on duck 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.909
 geese you have if bright monkey it's all 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.070
 where will mask that is if you 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.500
 are stationary rolls lying 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 you are monkey hidden or find us 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.330
 your mothers hidden here have them 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.970
 when to think about disguise 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.010
 but in my case I â€™m on the contrary Iâ€™m not coming 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.940
 not really like bright monkey plus how would 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 you see for yourself what happens is the first 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.070
 factor 2 in the spring hunt falls 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.810
 work with your hands and when you monica 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.600
 work with your hands dreams 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.350
 movements and this is unmasking dima and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 disguise
