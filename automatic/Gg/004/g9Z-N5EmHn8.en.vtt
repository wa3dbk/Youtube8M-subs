there's a lot of reasons for it there's

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.680 
there's a lot of reasons for it there's
different<00:00:07.890> sections<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.880> are<00:00:08.940> pretty<00:00:09.330> tough

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
different sections that are pretty tough

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.970 
different sections that are pretty tough
the<00:00:10.530> way<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> learned<00:00:11.099> how<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> do<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.480> one

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
the way I learned how to do this one

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.230 
the way I learned how to do this one
besides<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.190> doing<00:00:14.429> over<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.849> over<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> over

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
besides is doing over and over and over

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750 
besides is doing over and over and over
as<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.929> practices<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.100> different<00:00:17.279> parts

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
as a practices in two different parts

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.090 
as a practices in two different parts
the<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.660> part<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.680> want<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.980> practice

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the first part you want to practice

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070 
the first part you want to practice
jumping<00:00:20.640> heavy<00:00:20.880> kick<00:00:21.240> catching<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> light

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
jumping heavy kick catching the light

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.599 
jumping heavy kick catching the light
punch<00:00:22.820> into<00:00:24.529> crashing<00:00:25.529> ahead<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.830> front<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
punch into crashing ahead in front and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.840 
punch into crashing ahead in front and
then<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:28.050> down<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:29.060> cancel<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.850> heavy

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
then down down for cancel into the heavy

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.350 
then down down for cancel into the heavy
shoryuken<00:00:33.380> you're<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.210> do<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
shoryuken you're going to want to do it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
shoryuken you're going to want to do it
until<00:00:36.510> you're<00:00:36.899> comfortable<00:00:37.079> getting<00:00:38.059> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
until you're comfortable getting the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.840 
until you're comfortable getting the
first<00:00:39.329> four<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.950> obviously<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
first four and obviously if you can

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.819 
first four and obviously if you can
handle<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> heavy<00:00:43.710> short

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
handle that get to the heavy short

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
handle that get to the heavy short
review<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> learn<00:00:45.960> how<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
review and you have to learn how to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
review and you have to learn how to
focus<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
focus out of it and the way to do that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.209 
focus out of it and the way to do that
is<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> wait<00:00:49.020> after<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.559> first<00:00:49.800> hit<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
is have to wait after the first hit and

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.319 
is have to wait after the first hit and
because<00:00:53.219> there's<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> couple<00:00:53.640> stages<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
because there's a couple stages to the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.279 
because there's a couple stages to the
heavy<00:00:54.510> shoryuken<00:00:56.149> if<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.329> wait<00:00:57.629> too<00:00:57.780> long<00:00:58.020> as

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
heavy shoryuken if you wait too long as

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
heavy shoryuken if you wait too long as
not<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.620> work<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.100> too<00:00:59.250> soon<00:00:59.489> I'll<00:00:59.609> just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
not if I work if it's too soon I'll just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.930 
not if I work if it's too soon I'll just
stand<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
stand there like that so you have to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.390 
stand there like that so you have to
wait<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.750> longer

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.170 

like<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:09.440> once<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> point<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
like that once you get to that point you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
like that once you get to that point you
need<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.050> practice<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.530> second

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
need to just you can practice the second

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
need to just you can practice the second
half<00:01:14.070> which<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.610> basically<00:01:14.970> starting<00:01:15.480> off

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
half which is basically starting off

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840 
half which is basically starting off
with<00:01:15.720> crafting<00:01:16.140> heavy<00:01:16.350> punch<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.490> too<00:01:17.670> heavy

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
with crafting heavy punch and too heavy

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
with crafting heavy punch and too heavy
sure<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.740> cancel<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.160> into<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sure you can cancel out of it into the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
sure you can cancel out of it into the
median<00:01:21.240> punch<00:01:22.700> sure<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.940> can<00:01:24.410> into<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.530> ultra

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
median punch sure you can into the ultra

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.550 
median punch sure you can into the ultra
and<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:27.120> should<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.600> able<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and you should be able to do that a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
and you should be able to do that a
couple<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:29.010> times<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
couple of times you don't have to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
couple of times you don't have to
necessarily<00:01:30.260> connect<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.530> lot<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
necessarily connect a lot just know that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.350 
necessarily connect a lot just know that
you<00:01:32.940> can<00:01:33.090> actually<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:35.120> just<00:01:36.120> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you can actually do it and then just you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:02:12.030 
you can actually do it and then just you
know<00:01:37.370> keep<00:01:38.370> doing<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> beginning

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:35.020 

Oh

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.090 

you
