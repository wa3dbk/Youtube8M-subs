so<00:00:18.490> plenty<00:00:18.880> resistance<00:00:20.340> draw<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.400> belly<00:00:21.670> in

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789

head lifted drop the heels down
especially<00:00:28.570> when<00:00:28.869> you've<00:00:29.050> got<00:00:29.259> lots<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.070> lots

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
especially when you've got lots and lots

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.490 
especially when you've got lots and lots
of<00:00:30.369> resistance<00:00:36.780> trying<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.870> speed<00:00:38.110> up<00:00:38.290> now

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
of resistance trying to speed up now

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.509 
of resistance trying to speed up now
this<00:00:38.830> recovery<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.460> on<00:00:39.580> its<00:00:39.730> way

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
this recovery is on its way

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.560 
this recovery is on its way
well<00:00:42.519> done<00:00:42.790> brilliant

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
well done brilliant

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.750 
well done brilliant
well<00:00:44.559> they'll<00:00:44.769> keep<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.129> upper<00:00:45.309> body<00:00:45.460> nice

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
well they'll keep the upper body nice

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.610 
well they'll keep the upper body nice
and<00:00:45.820> strong<00:00:46.390> so<00:00:46.660> you<00:00:46.720> just<00:00:46.900> working<00:00:47.290> from<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
and strong so you just working from the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.369 
and strong so you just working from the
hips<00:00:49.979> almost<00:00:50.979> there<00:00:51.839> so<00:00:52.839> it's<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.019> little<00:00:53.049> bit

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
hips almost there so it's a little bit

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.049 
hips almost there so it's a little bit
easy<00:00:53.589> to<00:00:53.920> just<00:00:54.129> push<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.610> boundaries<00:00:54.970> a

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
easy to just push the boundaries a

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:03.279 
easy to just push the boundaries a
little<00:00:55.239> bit<00:00:55.500> you've<00:00:56.500> got<00:00:56.530> ten<00:00:56.890> more<00:00:57.070> seconds

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.539 

and<00:01:03.800> recover<00:01:05.259> so<00:01:06.259> allow<00:01:06.590> your<00:01:06.890> legs<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.220> slow

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
and recover so allow your legs to slow

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.179 
and recover so allow your legs to slow
yourself<00:01:07.729> down<00:01:08.090> using<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.810> resistance

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
yourself down using the resistance

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.649 
yourself down using the resistance
you've<00:01:10.189> got<00:01:10.369> five<00:01:10.610> seconds<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:11.299> we're<00:01:11.420> going

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
you've got five seconds and we're going

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.330 
you've got five seconds and we're going
again<00:01:11.930> how<00:01:12.470> does<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:12.770> feel

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
again how does that feel
