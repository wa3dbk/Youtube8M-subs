00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:39.939
 percent 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.390
 this is for the rhythmics they are from 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.970
 remake roughly how the slab and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.760
 voices music so like playing 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.760
 listen to it explained to us 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.769

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 1 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.570

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:14.080
 ah bah actually new to the bar at the conflict 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:23.040
 a few times a little yes bring us how 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:23.040
 I was cut otherwise we will be closer 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.959
 French-speaking fans 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.860
 we went to the back my level I'm doing 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.250
 a little trick is a beautiful style and 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.360
 it's just a dead how much by the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.360
 duration makes that to the feminine 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.830
 we do not pass to the back when you 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.150
 go to attack your first dolphin 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.150
 from then with the middle finger 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.050
 or 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:42.729
 so to settle it's really all in 

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:44.709
 2d taxes or cut each time you 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.039
 go down and up a couple and 

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:49.989
 will escape without the mention of a blow 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.659

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.039
