00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 yes , people are also called with a warm heart 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 Welcome to a new video and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.220
 why was I inactive for so long now 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.450
 I wonder maybe I hate for 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.860
 videos not you even so to what 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.000
 announce but it is simply one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 logical explanation is times 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 I had an exchange partner out there 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.730
 ireland was all white the white four days 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.380
 Here and there he only has four days instead 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.600
 from the planned seven days over the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.800
 program even more compressed yet 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.269
 stuffed and that's why I had 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 really no time for youtube 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.510
 hope you understand that really bad 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.000
 motivated and will also be the week 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800
 ill try many videos out his 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 because i have to look this issue 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 time but I think that there 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.219
 something works 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.250
 I have many thanks in 2008 too 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.170
 this is pretty nice and the 2000 abo 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 special montage I can also relatively 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.579
 Well, so far the comments and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
 nice dream it is with the clicks out 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.420
 as it is so refined and so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.180
 I thought today mostly come ass 2 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.340
 fouls and oldschool weapons review about 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 a weapon that was much desired in the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.079
 water stevie g km means really often 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
 mentioned in the comments of the whole 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 soft weapon but it is not me 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 but really we will come to that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.270
 later, first I have to be the b 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 league is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.260
 Well, no really great sniper 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 has about all data about 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 mean then nothing special not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.110
 especially bad but not too 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.670
 especially good values 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.380
 face so considering the circle 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.140
 And also on the price how much you 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.670
 upgrade costs so it is gold 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 actually completely acceptable 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.450
 Now you can already to the advantages 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 first advantage is the damage with 508 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 not very high but not at 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.170
 sniper rifles actually always the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 so harm automatic advantage because 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 the critical hits just like that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.079
 dominance over almost everyone actually 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.140
 almost every shot is a critical one 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.119
 hit and therefore an uncle of the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 properly made unnecessary by 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 this skill points through that applies with the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.869
 critical hits the desktop is the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 second advantage of this very precise and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.210
 also cleaned up so the crosshairs is 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.829
 I can set with the part very fine 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 handle very well as with the scope and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.689
 that also goes well on headshots that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.550
 the third ford is that the weapon is not 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.890
 as dominant animation has as 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.130
 example interna like her dearest 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.860
 Lisbon 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.110
 feels like it takes almost 23 seconds and 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.910
 that coop 1 1 to look for and get out again 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.340
 to do that pisses me off at the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 weapons and the wwk yes not so 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.640
 bad but of course not so good 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.040
 as with the ms loosen 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 what just left the ghost apps 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 the just these values ​​are output 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.580
 one has no wobblers on 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.560
 So it's really unnecessary to script if you do 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 the score is really unnecessary 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.380
 wackler this when removing or how 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.660
 also strong jump with the dearest 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.070
 readers are and the range of the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.310
 also very good with 300 meters 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.080
 Questionable also in the shop 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.420
 never actually reach this 300 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.820
 meter that actually creates the weapon 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.470
 almost twice as much, I mean 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.230
 all storm rifles or firearms 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.340
 the range is actually correct 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.690
 wrongly stated in the shop except 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.030
 Maybe with Schott or something 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.590
 the guests well who cares 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.540
 Of course that does not mean anything 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.150
 the precision is also very good 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.710
 from the movie you hit everything and there 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.530
 There is nothing to complain about the disco 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.850
 Partial zooming can not 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.730
 subsequently pure from it but looking for it 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.080
 actually has a very pleasant too 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.730
 determine RanGes it is not 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.250
 it is about addiction and reach 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.480
 still okay and yes after hall of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.770
 the weapon is ammo is trump 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.670
 where the weapon where I say that not so 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.060
 a good 5 times 4 544 magazines in total on 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.890
 begin 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.950
 I find little time to run 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.900
 really easy car fan the fire wheel 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.160
 is also the next disadvantage and then 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.090
 I would like to say a little more about that 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.950
 That's not so bad at 110 rpm 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.330
 but then I explain what we do 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.610
 even with my personal conclusion 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.880
 are and indeed it is such a mixture 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.630
 from automatic weapon against the before 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.730
 so rate because of the high before rate 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.980
 and manually operated on manual 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.050
 operated weapons such as the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.459
 cd fought that is such a mix the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.470
 vegetarian from the 7th 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.570
 and that makes it really hard 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.010
 this for me to play this weapon 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.840
 because I do not know which 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.220
 play style i should go 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.140
 shall I with a slot program 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.060
 maybe I risk one 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.430
 grant prix celebrate the third goal 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.720
 or should i really be completely safe on the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.290
 go kids 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.850
 at the cbm or camp must do so 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.590
 that's just too hard for me 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.870
 different was the weapon so like 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.570
 I personally am not so sure 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.580
 but that they have a good transitional weapon 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.900
 yes, yes, none of the higher ones 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.810
 real pros sorry but but I like it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.340
 just once to the professionals so this 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.040
 good exercise in between a good bridge 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.990
 and from the slot booking so look 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.940
 really cool from the part is one 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.270
 standard sniper rifle is not like that right now 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.340
 childish shit how deep can that be 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.200
 simply no one needs a horny 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.720
 weapons design horny shot noise and 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.270
 yes clear purchase recommendation from me 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.210
 this weapon so now briefly to the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.430
 Fields of activity before the part as opponent 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.560
 I would really only one more 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.540
 really take really bad 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.810
 opponent to the upper level limit the 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.490
 Drum from the drum is really op 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.000
 with storm rifles with the skill points 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.440
 and raps I would actually all kinds 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.120
 You really can say on all kinds 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.710
 of play until maybe my 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.270
 hostess that is a bit too small 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.919
 you simply will not come forth 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.810
 already needs an automatic snow 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.240
 then really good to let off steam 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.860
 so is too short to the skill of 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.169
 skin claim is really in demand 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.669
 takes some skill to the 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.070
 weapon to play well 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.580
 I give it four out of conclusively 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.260
 possible five stars 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.380
 I personally was not like that but it did 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.820
 easy yes for for what they for 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.260
 Price performance and offers it here 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.640
 you have to do something very good 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.840
 I hope that again I had 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.220
 fallen that was it again 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.410
 I wanted to hint briefly that I 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.970
 will do more with you now 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.560
 youtube on as I will soon 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.600
 something to do with pocket lp 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.070
 i have to look if there are any teachers in there 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.330
 the week with him what am I going to 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.210
 had stopped also to stress at school 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.370
 around with markus so the channel of gods of 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:20.010
 I will also do something display and yes 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.010
 really far , or an abo very much
