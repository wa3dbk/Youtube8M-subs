ordered me more I own significance and I

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.690 
ordered me more I own significance and I
let<00:02:30.870> her<00:02:31.020> borrow<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.740> by<00:02:31.920> Shelley<00:02:32.280> crane

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.970 
let her borrow it it's by Shelley crane
and<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.570> didn't<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.080> other<00:02:34.290> books<00:02:34.710> in<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and I didn't have the other books in the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.220 
and I didn't have the other books in the
series<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.730> she<00:02:35.820> went<00:02:36.120> ahead<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.690> bought<00:02:36.960> them

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
series so she went ahead and bought them

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.230 
series so she went ahead and bought them
and<00:02:37.470> read<00:02:37.650> them<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.100> then<00:02:38.520> gave<00:02:38.700> them<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.090> me

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and read them and then gave them to me

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.750 
and read them and then gave them to me
because<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:40.020> think<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.800> probably<00:02:41.220> her

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
because I think it's probably her

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.730 
because I think it's probably her
favorite<00:02:42.420> series<00:02:42.840> or<00:02:43.020> one<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.290> her<00:02:43.380> favorite

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
favorite series or one of her favorite

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.950 
favorite series or one of her favorite
series<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.250> she's<00:02:44.430> ever<00:02:44.580> read<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
series that she's ever read and it's a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.190 
series that she's ever read and it's a
young<00:02:46.140> adult<00:02:46.470> i<00:02:46.590> believe<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.400> she<00:02:47.670> bought<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
young adult i believe so she bought the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.750 
young adult i believe so she bought the
second<00:02:49.200> third<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.500> fourth<00:02:49.740> book<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.370> gave

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
second third and fourth book and gave

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.250 
second third and fourth book and gave
them<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.210> me<00:02:51.360> after<00:02:51.630> she<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:51.870> done<00:02:51.990> reading

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
them to me after she was done reading

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.890 
them to me after she was done reading
them<00:02:52.530> i<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> right<00:02:54.600> order

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
them i I think this is the right order

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.920 
them i I think this is the right order
so<00:02:55.520> accordance<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.940> think<00:02:57.240> that's<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.570> second

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
so accordance I think that's the second

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.490 
so accordance I think that's the second
book<00:02:58.050> but<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.350> not<00:02:58.500> sure<00:02:58.530> then<00:03:00.110> defiant<00:03:01.110> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
book but I'm not sure then defiant and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.010 
book but I'm not sure then defiant and
then<00:03:01.770> independent<00:03:02.730> she<00:03:03.000> loves<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.630> series

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
then independent she loves that series

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.420 
then independent she loves that series
and<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.320> gets<00:03:04.440> really<00:03:04.650> high<00:03:04.890> ratings<00:03:05.250> on
