00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050

they<00:01:37.410> were<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.740> were<00:01:37.800> pretty<00:01:38.369> gracious<00:01:38.820> they

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
they were they were pretty gracious they

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.370 
they were they were pretty gracious they
didn't<00:01:39.179> give<00:01:39.300> me<00:01:39.330> nearly<00:01:39.690> as<00:01:39.750> many<00:01:39.840> pimples<00:01:40.259> as

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
didn't give me nearly as many pimples as

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.510

I<00:01:40.470> had<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.800> was<00:01:40.890> younger

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.319 

I<00:01:46.609> think<00:01:47.270> they're<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.479> lot<00:01:47.659> looser<00:01:48.109> and<00:01:48.469> a

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
I think they're a lot looser and a

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.260 
I think they're a lot looser and a
little<00:01:50.329> more<00:01:50.890> gritty<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.189> maybe<00:01:53.000> have<00:01:53.240> a

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
little more gritty and maybe have a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.929 
little more gritty and maybe have a
little<00:01:53.539> bit<00:01:53.689> more<00:01:54.219> personality<00:01:55.219> it's<00:01:55.640> sort<00:01:55.850> of

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
little bit more personality it's sort of

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.090 
little bit more personality it's sort of
baked<00:01:56.149> into<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.990> basic<00:01:57.380> model<00:01:57.710> yeah<00:01:58.070> I

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
baked into the the basic model yeah I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.350 
baked into the the basic model yeah I

know or like you know you know
scratching<00:02:10.849> yourself<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.810> then<00:02:11.900> go<00:02:12.049> on<00:02:12.170> you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
scratching yourself and then go on you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.080 
scratching yourself and then go on you
know<00:02:12.530> making<00:02:12.739> coffee

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.390 

this<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.230> our<00:02:17.349> first<00:02:17.560> game<00:02:17.709> where<00:02:17.890> we<00:02:17.980> did<00:02:18.160> full

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
this is our first game where we did full

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.479 
this is our first game where we did full
linear<00:02:18.940> motion<00:02:19.300> capture<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:20.260> each<00:02:20.440> song<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
linear motion capture for each song and

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.699 
linear motion capture for each song and
I<00:02:21.580> gave<00:02:21.700> us<00:02:21.819> an<00:02:21.910> opportunity<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.750> use<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I gave us an opportunity to use the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.170 
I gave us an opportunity to use the
stage<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.220> waiting<00:02:24.550> day<00:02:24.640> actually<00:02:25.000> does

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
stage the waiting day actually does

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.050 
stage the waiting day actually does
linear<00:02:25.810> motion<00:02:26.170> capture<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.680> what<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:27.790> call

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
linear motion capture is what we call

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.540 
linear motion capture is what we call
like<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.660> song<00:02:29.349> starting<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> band

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
like a song starting and the band

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.030

performs the song it's in its entirety

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.490 
performs the song it's in its entirety
and<00:02:33.459> then<00:02:34.060> stops<00:02:34.360> when<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.599> song<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.019> over<00:02:35.170> and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and then stops when the song is over and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500 
and then stops when the song is over and

we knew exactly what the songs were we

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.089 
we knew exactly what the songs were we
knew<00:02:46.690> who<00:02:46.900> was<00:02:47.019> in<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> band<00:02:47.440> how<00:02:47.769> many<00:02:47.980> guys

are in the band we knew everything about
the<00:02:50.680> songs<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.150> song<00:02:52.360> was<00:02:52.540> able<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> be

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the songs so the song was able to be

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900 
the songs so the song was able to be
captured<00:02:53.319> linearly<00:02:53.829> from<00:02:54.190> start<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.880> finish

captured linearly from start to finish

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.190 
captured linearly from start to finish
and<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:56.440> get<00:02:56.620> incredible<00:02:56.980> nuances<00:02:57.790> like

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
and you get incredible nuances like

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.589 
and you get incredible nuances like
there<00:02:59.200> will<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.440> guitar<00:02:59.829> break<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.599> Billie

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
there will be a guitar break and Billie

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.449 
there will be a guitar break and Billie
Joe<00:03:01.870> will<00:03:02.049> like<00:03:02.170> jump<00:03:02.440> up<00:03:02.590> onto<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:03.010> monitor

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
Joe will like jump up onto the monitor

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.240 
Joe will like jump up onto the monitor
and<00:03:03.700> either<00:03:04.390> address<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.989> crowd<00:03:05.470> or<00:03:05.980> be

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250

playing<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.549> guitar<00:03:06.670> solo<00:03:07.120> or<00:03:07.450> whatever<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> is

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
playing a guitar solo or whatever it is

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.229 
playing a guitar solo or whatever it is
he'll<00:03:08.650> meander<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.370> jump<00:03:09.849> over<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.209> another

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
he'll meander and jump over to another

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.780 
he'll meander and jump over to another
monitor<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.200> then<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:12.069> like<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> second

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
monitor and then it's like a second

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.280 
monitor and then it's like a second
before<00:03:12.940> Billy<00:03:13.329> Joe<00:03:13.540> supposed<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.930> sing<00:03:14.140> again

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
before Billy Joe supposed to sing again

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.460 
before Billy Joe supposed to sing again
and<00:03:14.739> he's<00:03:15.250> way<00:03:15.640> far<00:03:15.940> away<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:17.319> would

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
and he's way far away and you would

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.020 
and he's way far away and you would
imagine<00:03:17.680> our<00:03:18.040> systems<00:03:18.400> gonna<00:03:18.579> break<00:03:18.819> but

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
imagine our systems gonna break but

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.819 
imagine our systems gonna break but
because<00:03:19.239> it's<00:03:19.390> linear<00:03:19.540> mocap<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.440> guy<00:03:20.590> just

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
because it's linear mocap the guy just

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.759 
because it's linear mocap the guy just
like<00:03:21.010> runs<00:03:21.519> over<00:03:22.150> jumps<00:03:22.630> across<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.290> before

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
like runs over jumps across and before

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.400 
like runs over jumps across and before
even<00:03:23.980> lands<00:03:24.579> he's<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:24.910> leaning<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.319> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
even lands he's like leaning in to the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.830 
even lands he's like leaning in to the
microphone<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.310> start<00:03:27.639> singing<00:03:27.940> starts

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
microphone to start singing starts

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.170 
microphone to start singing starts
singing<00:03:29.260> lands<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.040> plays<00:03:30.310> guitar<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.940> you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
singing lands and plays guitar and you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.240 
singing lands and plays guitar and you
know<00:03:31.269> as<00:03:31.480> Billy<00:03:31.810> Joe<00:03:32.079> bounces<00:03:32.590> all<00:03:32.829> around<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
know as Billy Joe bounces all around the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.160 
know as Billy Joe bounces all around the
stage<00:03:33.489> like<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.940> maniac<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.630> cameraman<00:03:35.079> is

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
stage like a maniac the cameraman is

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.599 
stage like a maniac the cameraman is
trying<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.590> stay<00:03:35.799> out<00:03:35.829> of<00:03:35.950> his<00:03:36.040> way<00:03:36.099> he's

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
trying to stay out of his way he's

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.220 
trying to stay out of his way he's
trying<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:36.940> keep<00:03:37.060> them<00:03:37.239> in<00:03:37.359> frame<00:03:37.720> we<00:03:38.079> also

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
trying to keep them in frame we also

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.620 
trying to keep them in frame we also
look<00:03:38.709> have<00:03:38.920> some<00:03:39.099> of<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.220> cameras<00:03:39.609> so<00:03:40.389> there's

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
look have some of the cameras so there's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.360 
look have some of the cameras so there's
a<00:03:40.780> camera<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.139> each<00:03:41.319> of<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.560> guys<00:03:41.680> throughout

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
a camera on each of the guys throughout

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.280 
a camera on each of the guys throughout
each<00:03:42.519> song<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.060> they're<00:03:43.239> moving<00:03:43.420> around<00:03:43.780> and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
each song and they're moving around and

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.559 
each song and they're moving around and
zooming<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:44.980> tracking<00:03:45.639> and<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:45.940> gave

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
zooming in and tracking and that gave

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.879 
zooming in and tracking and that gave
them<00:03:46.780> an<00:03:46.900> opportunity<00:03:46.959> not<00:03:47.349> only<00:03:47.410> interact

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
them an opportunity not only interact

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.309 
them an opportunity not only interact
with<00:03:48.069> each<00:03:48.160> other<00:03:48.340> but<00:03:48.700> interact<00:03:49.209> with<00:03:49.569> with

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
with each other but interact with with

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.750
