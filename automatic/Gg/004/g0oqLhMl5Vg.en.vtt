and<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.040> click<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.340> one<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> tells<00:02:00.479> me

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and if I click on one it tells me

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
and if I click on one it tells me
everything<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.829> then

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
everything I want to know about it then

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
everything I want to know about it then
I<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> second<00:02:02.909> page<00:02:03.060> tells<00:02:03.689> me<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
I go to the second page tells me all the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.929 
I go to the second page tells me all the

torque and speed and power that it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.559 
torque and speed and power that it
produces<00:02:08.459> we'll<00:02:08.580> talk<00:02:08.729> about<00:02:08.910> power<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.360> depth

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
produces we'll talk about power in depth

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
produces we'll talk about power in depth
later<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:10.349> nice<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> say<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.009> reading

making machines you have to make a blast
furnace<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:36.000> gateway<00:02:37.000> into

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
furnace this is the gateway into

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.910 
furnace this is the gateway into
rotorcraft<00:02:37.900> because<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.770> get

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
rotorcraft because you have to get

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.730 
rotorcraft because you have to get
rotary<00:02:39.520> class<00:02:39.700> special<00:02:40.330> steel<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.620> is

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
rotary class special steel and this is

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.780 
rotary class special steel and this is
the<00:02:41.800> only<00:02:41.980> way<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.250> make<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.460> well<00:02:42.670> it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
the only way to make it well it's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.340 
the only way to make it well it's
another<00:02:43.030> way<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.270> make<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.290> is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
another way to make it but but this is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.680 
another way to make it but but this is
the<00:02:44.530> only<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:45.010> make<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.690> getting

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the only way you can make it getting

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.720 
the only way you can make it getting
into<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.470> really<00:02:47.680> cheap<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.490> just

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
into it and it's really cheap it's just

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.490 
into it and it's really cheap it's just
piece<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.060> redstone<00:02:49.210> dust<00:02:49.570> surrounded<00:02:50.350> by

cheap and easy to use easy to get so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.620 
cheap and easy to use easy to get so
that's<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> blast<00:02:56.080> furnace<00:02:57.210> we<00:02:58.210> go<00:02:58.300> on

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
that's the blast furnace we go on

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.250 
that's the blast furnace we go on
so<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.850> blast<00:03:01.090> furnace<00:03:01.450> let's<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.050> break

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
so the blast furnace let's just break

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.460 
so the blast furnace let's just break
this<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:03.220> blast<00:03:03.460> furnace<00:03:03.850> has<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.120> be<00:03:04.470> heated

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
this the blast furnace has to be heated

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.460 
this the blast furnace has to be heated
in<00:03:06.100> order<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.550> work<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.930> coal<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.350> you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
in order to work it the coal that you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.410 
in order to work it the coal that you
put<00:03:08.650> into<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.890> blast<00:03:09.070> furnace<00:03:09.430> does<00:03:09.730> not<00:03:09.970> heat

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
put into the blast furnace does not heat

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.940 
put into the blast furnace does not heat
it<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.690> not<00:03:10.810> like<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.990> furnace<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.560> regular

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
it it's not like a furnace a regular

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.280 
it it's not like a furnace a regular
furnace<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.340> burns<00:03:12.750> resources<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:13.930> heated

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
furnace that burns resources it's heated

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.230 
furnace that burns resources it's heated
by<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.470> environment<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.910> best<00:03:16.090> way<00:03:16.210> to

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
by the environment and the best way to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.930 
by the environment and the best way to
do<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.500> put<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> block<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.550> lot<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.820> a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
do that is to put a block of lot of a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.870 
do that is to put a block of lot of a
underneath<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.870> blast<00:03:20.050> furnace<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.250> don't

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
underneath the blast furnace so I don't

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930 
underneath the blast furnace so I don't
pop<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> hole<00:03:22.450> put<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.110> block<00:03:23.400> put<00:03:24.400> lava<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.790> there

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
pop a hole put a block put lava in there

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.630 
pop a hole put a block put lava in there
place<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.690> last<00:03:25.870> furnace<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.220> starts<00:03:27.550> at

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
place the last furnace so it starts at

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.460 
place the last furnace so it starts at
40<00:03:28.000> C<00:03:28.239> because<00:03:28.570> we're<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.840> desert<00:03:29.080> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
40 C because we're in a desert the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.949 
40 C because we're in a desert the
deserts<00:03:29.830> ambient<00:03:30.400> temperature<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:30.970> 40<00:03:31.270> C<00:03:31.480> over

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
deserts ambient temperature is 40 C over

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.870 
deserts ambient temperature is 40 C over
in<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.140> grassy<00:03:32.560> area<00:03:32.860> over<00:03:33.100> there<00:03:33.250> it'd<00:03:33.400> be<00:03:33.550> 20

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
in the grassy area over there it'd be 20

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.570 
in the grassy area over there it'd be 20
and<00:03:34.060> if<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.750> put<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.110> like<00:03:35.470> over<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.770> block<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
and if you put this like over a block of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.210 
and if you put this like over a block of
water<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.030> cools<00:03:37.239> it<00:03:37.390> down<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.600> bit<00:03:38.050> but<00:03:39.040> now<00:03:39.160> you

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
water it cools it down a bit but now you

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.550 
water it cools it down a bit but now you
see<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.850> temperature<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.360> rising<00:03:40.600> it's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
see that the temperature is rising it's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.040 
see that the temperature is rising it's
heating<00:03:41.830> up<00:03:41.950> by<00:03:42.489> without<00:03:42.700> Oh<00:03:42.940> once<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.840> see

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
heating up by without Oh once to see

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.930 
heating up by without Oh once to see
every<00:03:44.320> second<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.640> will<00:03:45.820> eventually

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
every second and this will eventually

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.750 
every second and this will eventually
get<00:03:46.390> up<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.660> 640<00:03:47.500> C<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.070> then<00:03:48.160> stop<00:03:48.459> because

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
get up to 640 C and then stop because

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.390 
get up to 640 C and then stop because
it's<00:03:48.970> hot<00:03:49.150> as<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.540> lava<00:03:50.050> can<00:03:50.380> make<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.800> blast

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
it's hot as the lava can make the blast

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.190 
it's hot as the lava can make the blast
furnace<00:03:51.670> that's<00:03:51.820> perfect<00:03:52.239> because<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:53.050> only

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
furnace that's perfect because you only

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.020 
furnace that's perfect because you only
need<00:03:53.290> 600

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
need 600

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.180 
need 600
and<00:03:55.350> so<00:03:56.350> that's<00:03:56.470> how<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.740> have<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:56.950> say<00:03:57.070> out

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
and so that's how you have to say out

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.500 
and so that's how you have to say out
your<00:03:57.310> blast<00:03:57.460> furnace<00:03:57.820> with<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.120> piece<00:03:58.270> of<00:03:58.390> lava

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
your blast furnace with a piece of lava

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.300 
your blast furnace with a piece of lava
underneath<00:03:58.960> it<00:03:59.110> alright<00:03:59.890> so<00:03:59.920> once<00:04:00.190> you've

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
underneath it alright so once you've

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.130 
underneath it alright so once you've
done<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.460> and<00:04:00.820> your<00:04:01.240> blast<00:04:01.750> furnace<00:04:02.080> is

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
done that and your blast furnace is

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.970 
done that and your blast furnace is
heated<00:04:02.470> up<00:04:02.590> like<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.310> one<00:04:03.460> is<00:04:04.980> Goodman's

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
heated up like this one is Goodman's

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.680 
heated up like this one is Goodman's
site<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:06.550> can<00:04:06.670> actually<00:04:06.820> start<00:04:07.630> making

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
site and we can actually start making

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.460 
site and we can actually start making
some<00:04:08.110> steel<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:09.340> this<00:04:10.180> may<00:04:10.390> look<00:04:10.660> intimidating

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
some steel so this may look intimidating

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.860 
some steel so this may look intimidating
but<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.640> cannot<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.030> can<00:04:13.180> click<00:04:13.300> on<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.630> if

you have the handbook to go straight to

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.660 
you have the handbook to go straight to
the<00:04:17.109> blast<00:04:17.350> furnaces<00:04:17.829> handbook<00:04:18.250> page<00:04:18.489> which

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
the blast furnaces handbook page which

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.479 
the blast furnaces handbook page which
is<00:04:18.790> awesome<00:04:19.500> okay<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:20.980> I<00:04:21.010> know<00:04:21.160> how<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.370> use

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
is awesome okay but I know how to use

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.870 
is awesome okay but I know how to use
this<00:04:21.670> okay<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.050> need<00:04:23.260> four<00:04:23.830> resources<00:04:24.790> to

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
this okay so you need four resources to

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.580 
this okay so you need four resources to
make<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.090> blast<00:04:25.300> furnace<00:04:25.600> work<00:04:25.780> you<00:04:26.410> need

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
make the blast furnace work you need

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.840 
make the blast furnace work you need
coal<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:28.330> need<00:04:28.570> gunpowder<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.700> need

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
coal you need gunpowder and you need

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.400 
coal you need gunpowder and you need
sand<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.390> then<00:04:31.750> they<00:04:31.840> go<00:04:31.960> in<00:04:32.080> these<00:04:32.230> slots

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
sand and then they go in these slots

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.610 
sand and then they go in these slots
just<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.340> that<00:04:33.520> now<00:04:34.390> that<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:35.080> only<00:04:35.320> ever

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
just like that now that you only ever

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.950 
just like that now that you only ever
need<00:04:35.980> one<00:04:36.010> gunpowder<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:37.510> important<00:04:37.900> to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
need one gunpowder and it's important to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.040 
need one gunpowder and it's important to
note<00:04:38.970> gunpowder<00:04:39.970> is<00:04:40.090> used<00:04:40.240> as<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> catalyst<00:04:40.870> but

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
note gunpowder is used as a catalyst but

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.600 
note gunpowder is used as a catalyst but
it's<00:04:41.169> not<00:04:41.320> consumed<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.340> put<00:04:42.490> some

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
it's not consumed so just put some

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.920 
it's not consumed so just put some
gunpowder<00:04:42.910> in<00:04:43.150> there<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.419> you're<00:04:43.510> good<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.840> go

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
gunpowder in there and you're good to go

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.480 
gunpowder in there and you're good to go
it<00:04:44.230> will<00:04:44.410> consume<00:04:44.740> coal<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.070> will<00:04:45.190> consume

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
it will consume coal it will consume

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.940 
it will consume coal it will consume
sand<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:45.940> these<00:04:46.780> nine<00:04:47.020> slots<00:04:47.320> are<00:04:47.590> all<00:04:47.710> for

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
sand and these nine slots are all for

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.700 
sand and these nine slots are all for
Steve<00:04:48.130> for<00:04:48.610> iron<00:04:48.730> this<00:04:49.360> thing<00:04:49.630> smells<00:04:50.260> really

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
Steve for iron this thing smells really

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.830 
Steve for iron this thing smells really
quickly<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.310> can<00:04:51.910> get<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.300> large<00:04:52.630> amount

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
quickly and you can get a large amount

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.560 
quickly and you can get a large amount
of<00:04:53.110> steel<00:04:54.100> very<00:04:54.310> fast<00:04:54.640> because<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.150> will<00:04:55.330> smell

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
of steel very fast because it will smell

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.190 
of steel very fast because it will smell
9:00<00:04:55.900> at<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.320> time<00:04:57.270> no<00:04:58.270> matter<00:04:58.419> how<00:04:58.600> much<00:04:58.810> iron

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
9:00 at a time no matter how much iron

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.900 
9:00 at a time no matter how much iron
you're<00:04:59.380> looking<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.710> turn<00:04:59.860> into<00:04:59.979> steel<00:05:00.250> you

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
you're looking to turn into steel you

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.210 
you're looking to turn into steel you
should<00:05:01.090> always<00:05:01.330> fill<00:05:01.840> all<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.470> slots<00:05:02.770> so

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
should always fill all these slots so

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.430 
should always fill all these slots so
always<00:05:03.610> do<00:05:03.729> multiples<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.210> nine<00:05:04.419> always<00:05:05.200> fill

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
always do multiples of nine always fill

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680 
always do multiples of nine always fill
all<00:05:05.650> nine<00:05:05.830> slots<00:05:06.070> because<00:05:07.060> when<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.330> processes

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
all nine slots because when it processes

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.640 
all nine slots because when it processes
it<00:05:08.320> has<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.710> chance<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.490> double<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:11.260> output<00:05:11.290> of

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
it has a chance to double the output of

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.960 
it has a chance to double the output of
each<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:11.950> these<00:05:12.040> slots<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:12.550> if<00:05:12.640> you<00:05:12.729> fill<00:05:12.940> all

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
each of these slots so if you fill all

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.170 
each of these slots so if you fill all
nine<00:05:13.450> of<00:05:13.479> them<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.960> could<00:05:14.140> get<00:05:14.320> 17<00:05:14.919> or<00:05:15.220> 18

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
nine of them you could get 17 or 18

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.980 
nine of them you could get 17 or 18
steel<00:05:17.080> out<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.650> nine<00:05:18.100> ingots<00:05:18.640> so<00:05:19.540> definitely

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
steel out of nine ingots so definitely

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.890 
steel out of nine ingots so definitely
fill<00:05:20.169> all<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.560> slots<00:05:20.800> so<00:05:21.729> if<00:05:21.910> I<00:05:22.060> just<00:05:22.510> go<00:05:22.780> ahead

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
fill all the slots so if I just go ahead

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.460 
fill all the slots so if I just go ahead
and<00:05:23.470> fill<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.040> up<00:05:24.100> I<00:05:25.050> think<00:05:26.050> I<00:05:26.110> got<00:05:26.260> this<00:05:26.410> in

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
and fill this up I think I got this in

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.249 
and fill this up I think I got this in
the<00:05:26.650> wrong<00:05:26.770> slot

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.110 

there<00:05:31.259> we<00:05:31.349> go<00:05:31.439> I<00:05:31.650> had<00:05:31.979> it<00:05:32.069> wrong<00:05:32.189> sand<00:05:32.909> on<00:05:33.090> top

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
there we go I had it wrong sand on top

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.610 
there we go I had it wrong sand on top
coal<00:05:33.599> in<00:05:33.749> the<00:05:33.840> middle<00:05:34.050> gunpowder<00:05:34.439> on<00:05:34.560> the

I'm<00:05:35.729> sure<00:05:35.909> the<00:05:35.999> manual<00:05:36.659> probably<00:05:36.930> told<00:05:37.110> me

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
I'm sure the manual probably told me

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.559 
I'm sure the manual probably told me
that<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.800> it'll<00:05:38.340> run<00:05:38.550> see<00:05:38.849> it<00:05:39.029> runs<00:05:39.360> pretty

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
that and it'll run see it runs pretty

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.679 
that and it'll run see it runs pretty
quick<00:05:41.629> and<00:05:42.629> I<00:05:42.749> got<00:05:42.870> 13<00:05:43.430> hsla<00:05:44.430> steel<00:05:45.090> ingots<00:05:45.419> I

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
quick and I got 13 hsla steel ingots I

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.439 
quick and I got 13 hsla steel ingots I
put<00:05:46.199> nine<00:05:46.379> iron<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.189> got<00:05:47.610> 13<00:05:47.999> outs

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
put nine iron in I got 13 outs

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.089 
put nine iron in I got 13 outs
notice<00:05:48.749> it<00:05:48.870> only<00:05:48.930> took<00:05:49.169> one<00:05:49.469> off<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.889> each<00:05:49.979> of

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
notice it only took one off of each of

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.529 
notice it only took one off of each of
these<00:05:50.719> and<00:05:51.719> it<00:05:51.840> runs<00:05:52.020> again<00:05:53.210> consumes<00:05:54.210> nine

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
these and it runs again consumes nine

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.080 
these and it runs again consumes nine
and<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:55.080> got<00:05:55.199> 11<00:05:55.499> this<00:05:55.590> time<00:05:55.770> you<00:05:56.729> will<00:05:56.879> always

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
and I got 11 this time you will always

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.689 
and I got 11 this time you will always
get<00:05:57.479> extras<00:05:57.960> but<00:05:58.650> you<00:05:58.740> could<00:05:58.979> get<00:05:59.189> up<00:05:59.460> to

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
get extras but you could get up to

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.540 
get extras but you could get up to
almost<00:05:59.969> double<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:00.659> it's<00:06:00.779> really<00:06:00.930> great<00:06:01.550> it's

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
almost double so it's really great it's

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.219 
almost double so it's really great it's
really<00:06:02.759> efficient<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.419> notice<00:06:03.750> it's<00:06:03.900> used<00:06:04.080> up

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
really efficient you notice it's used up

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.899 
really efficient you notice it's used up
a<00:06:04.319> couple<00:06:04.469> of<00:06:04.590> coal<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:05.219> it's<00:06:05.490> only<00:06:05.580> use<00:06:05.729> up

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
a couple of coal and it's only use up

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.580 
a couple of coal and it's only use up
one<00:06:06.150> sand<00:06:06.689> I've<00:06:06.870> noticed<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.199> sand<00:06:07.409> doesn't

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
one sand I've noticed the sand doesn't

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.129 
one sand I've noticed the sand doesn't
always<00:06:07.800> go<00:06:08.009> down<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:09.210> coal<00:06:09.449> always<00:06:09.900> does

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
always go down the coal always does

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.290 
always go down the coal always does
that's<00:06:10.740> another<00:06:10.919> thing<00:06:11.129> if<00:06:11.789> you<00:06:11.939> remember<00:06:12.210> to

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
that's another thing if you remember to

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.879 
that's another thing if you remember to
fill<00:06:12.479> all<00:06:12.659> nine<00:06:12.840> slots<00:06:13.110> you're<00:06:13.500> going<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.740> make

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
fill all nine slots you're going to make

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.850 
fill all nine slots you're going to make
most<00:06:14.250> efficient<00:06:14.699> use<00:06:14.759> of<00:06:14.879> your<00:06:15.000> coal<00:06:18.469> and<00:06:19.469> you

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
most efficient use of your coal and you

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.980 
most efficient use of your coal and you
do<00:06:19.979> get<00:06:20.159> in<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:20.879> to<00:06:21.000> get<00:06:21.150> experience<00:06:21.810> for

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
do get in you to get experience for

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.860 
do get in you to get experience for
making<00:06:22.229> this<00:06:22.319> now<00:06:22.580> this<00:06:23.580> mod<00:06:23.789> uses<00:06:24.449> a<00:06:24.479> ton<00:06:24.839> of

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
making this now this mod uses a ton of

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.469 
making this now this mod uses a ton of
this<00:06:25.080> stuff<00:06:25.139> an<00:06:25.560> absolute<00:06:26.159> ton<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.849> Steel<00:06:27.210> so

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
this stuff an absolute ton of Steel so

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.360 
this stuff an absolute ton of Steel so
you're<00:06:27.599> going<00:06:27.719> to<00:06:27.749> need<00:06:27.839> a<00:06:27.900> lot<00:06:28.080> of<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.289> I<00:06:28.469> tend

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
you're going to need a lot of it I tend

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.219 
you're going to need a lot of it I tend
to<00:06:29.460> make<00:06:29.699> maybe<00:06:30.060> I<00:06:30.330> tend<00:06:30.599> to<00:06:30.689> like<00:06:30.839> fill<00:06:31.110> this

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
to make maybe I tend to like fill this

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.219 
to make maybe I tend to like fill this
twice<00:06:31.499> or<00:06:31.800> three<00:06:32.099> times<00:06:32.599> process<00:06:33.599> maybe<00:06:33.750> you

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
twice or three times process maybe you

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.170 
twice or three times process maybe you
know<00:06:34.319> between<00:06:34.560> 9<00:06:34.860> and<00:06:35.039> 18<00:06:35.189> sometimes<00:06:35.969> twenty

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
know between 9 and 18 sometimes twenty

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.019 
know between 9 and 18 sometimes twenty
seven<00:06:36.710> iron<00:06:37.710> ingots<00:06:38.129> and<00:06:38.310> that<00:06:38.580> usually<00:06:38.909> gives

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
seven iron ingots and that usually gives

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:40.100 
seven iron ingots and that usually gives
me<00:06:39.150> enough<00:06:39.360> steel<00:06:39.569> to<00:06:39.719> build<00:06:39.839> what<00:06:40.020> I'm

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
me enough steel to build what I'm

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.689 
me enough steel to build what I'm
looking<00:06:40.319> for<00:06:40.529> look<00:06:41.219> up<00:06:41.310> what<00:06:41.400> I'm<00:06:41.490> looking<00:06:41.669> to

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
looking for look up what I'm looking to

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.709 
looking for look up what I'm looking to
build<00:06:43.189> because<00:06:44.189> some<00:06:44.370> of<00:06:44.399> these<00:06:44.520> machines<00:06:45.300> do

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
build because some of these machines do

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:47.420 
build because some of these machines do
use<00:06:45.930> regular<00:06:46.319> iron<00:06:46.560> as<00:06:46.680> well<00:06:46.710> so<00:06:47.099> I<00:06:47.129> wouldn't

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
use regular iron as well so I wouldn't

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.860 
use regular iron as well so I wouldn't
turn<00:06:47.580> all<00:06:47.819> of<00:06:47.939> your<00:06:48.060> iron<00:06:48.210> into<00:06:48.479> steel

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
turn all of your iron into steel

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.429 
turn all of your iron into steel
but<00:06:49.469> once<00:06:49.620> you've<00:06:49.740> got<00:06:49.860> steel<00:06:51.319> you're<00:06:52.319> ready

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:52.439 
but once you've got steel you're ready

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:56.059 
but once you've got steel you're ready
to<00:06:52.560> get<00:06:52.649> going<00:06:54.259> there<00:06:55.259> we<00:06:55.349> go<00:06:55.409> we<00:06:55.500> process<00:06:55.889> all

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
to get going there we go we process all

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:56.480 
to get going there we go we process all
of<00:06:56.219> it

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
of it

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.240 
of it
remember<00:06:57.270> we<00:06:57.389> through<00:06:57.659> 64<00:06:58.500> iron<00:06:58.860> ingots<00:06:59.129> and

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
remember we through 64 iron ingots and

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.579 
remember we through 64 iron ingots and
only<00:06:59.550> 63<00:07:00.089> actually<00:07:00.479> went<00:07:00.629> in<00:07:00.750> here<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:01.169> we

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:01.589 
only 63 actually went in here and we

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:03.950 
only 63 actually went in here and we
ended<00:07:01.800> up<00:07:01.889> with<00:07:02.129> quite<00:07:02.460> a<00:07:02.520> bit<00:07:02.699> extra<00:07:03.029> steel<00:07:03.389> so

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
ended up with quite a bit extra steel so

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.249 
ended up with quite a bit extra steel so
blast<00:07:04.620> furnace<00:07:05.009> definitely<00:07:05.490> nice<00:07:06.169> good<00:07:07.169> at

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
blast furnace definitely nice good at

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.709 
blast furnace definitely nice good at
doubling<00:07:07.589> your<00:07:07.680> steel<00:07:07.949> so<00:07:08.310> that<00:07:08.550> is<00:07:09.389> the

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:09.719 
doubling your steel so that is the

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:11.300 
doubling your steel so that is the
