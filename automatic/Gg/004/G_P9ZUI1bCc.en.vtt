iPhone 4s screen you see my old one so I
suppose<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.520> should<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.730> able<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.060> replace<00:02:26.360> this

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
suppose I should be able to replace this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.560 
suppose I should be able to replace this
I'm<00:02:28.220> gonna<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.880> try<00:02:29.060> out<00:02:29.209> with<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
I'm gonna go in and try out with the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.960 
I'm gonna go in and try out with the
tools<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:34.730> work

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
tools and then you know if they work

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
tools and then you know if they work
then<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.540> might<00:02:35.720> do<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> video<00:02:35.990> on<00:02:36.530> how<00:02:36.890> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
then I might do a video on how to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040 
then I might do a video on how to
replace<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.550> now<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.240> seems<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.690> didn't

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050

using<00:02:52.850> things<00:02:53.030> here<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.930> should<00:02:54.080> probably

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
using things here you should probably

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
using things here you should probably
careful<00:02:54.770> with<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.830> how<00:02:58.070> it

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
careful with that but this is how it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.580 
careful with that but this is how it
looks<00:02:58.550> like<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.600> then<00:02:59.840> everything<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.440> would

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
looks like and then everything it would

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.380 
looks like and then everything it would
look<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:00.770> this<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.150> pretty

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
look like this but this is pretty

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.540 
look like this but this is pretty
interesting<00:03:02.890> yeah<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> quick<00:03:04.190> video<00:03:04.489> here

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
interesting yeah a quick video here

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.710 
interesting yeah a quick video here
quicker<00:03:05.030> boxing<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:07.070> iPhone<00:03:07.700> 4s<00:03:08.090> screen

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
quicker boxing of a iPhone 4s screen

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.190 
quicker boxing of a iPhone 4s screen
basically<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:10.630> that's<00:03:11.630> how<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.900> looks<00:03:12.110> like

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
basically and that's how it looks like

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.930 
basically and that's how it looks like
but<00:03:12.530> I'm<00:03:12.800> sure<00:03:13.040> if<00:03:13.160> these<00:03:13.340> tools<00:03:13.610> are<00:03:13.850> gonna

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
but I'm sure if these tools are gonna

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.420 
but I'm sure if these tools are gonna
