00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.790
 it is time to install the system 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.770
 drip irrigation reimers systems by 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.140
 drip for gardens are an excellent 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.170
 way to irrigate several areas of 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.930
 garden and conserve water the concept of 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.940
 drip irrigation gardens consists of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.690
 Apply the water directly to each 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.090
 plant slowly this has many 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.660
 advantages less water loss due to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.520
 evaporation and excessive watering 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.440
 precise application of water that improves 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.780
 the health of plants and reduces the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.879
 weeds besides the simplicity of 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.650
 installation and maintenance offered 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.129
 a drip irrigation system for 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.229
 gardens while the sprinklers 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.350
 normal are classified according to 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:57.350
 gallons per minute drip emitters 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.449
 they are classified in gallons per hour so 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.750
 that a drip zone will have a schedule 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.879
 of irrigation very different besides a system 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.180
 drip should be operated in an area 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.490
 other than sprinklers and rotors 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.370
 hydraulic connections available for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.200
 drip irrigation include one that goes to 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.869
 a key or hose 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.530
 abroad and another that connects to 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.530
 a post 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.010
 both games include a controller 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.010
 required pressure and a mesh filter 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 Here is another advice from the experts 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.229
 to make it easier to work with the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.860
 pipe during installation let 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.500
 Warm up in the sun before starting 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020
 the plants are planted a fence of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.920
 others we can use a hose with 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.560
 integrated emitters 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.659
 connect the hose of media emitters 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.659
 inch to the side of the t 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.580
 Store the hose to cover the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.990
 area that you want to water 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.810
 use stakes to keep them in place 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.410
 then return to the tf to complete the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.230
 circuit if the plants are separated 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.660
 with areas without vegetation between them use 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.300
 a normal half - inch hose and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 install individual transmitters where the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.550
 need to use the practical piercer 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.760
 hoses to open a hole in 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.610
 insert the emitter 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 as a general rule use two or more 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.250
 emitters distributed over the area of 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.829
 roots to achieve uniform irrigation without 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.260
 However, keep in mind that the number and 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:46.689
 size of the issuers will depend on the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.689
 Irrigation needs of each plant 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.480
 instead of forming a lap circuit 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.290
 to t in this area we will use a plug of 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.960
 half an inch 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.710
 at the end of rinsing the system 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.190
 place the double plug on the hose and 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.440
 place the clamp down to 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.900
 reduce evaporation we will cover the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.930
 hose and emitters with a layer of 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.300
 mulch there are many examples of how 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.610
 Irrigation products can be used for 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.100
 drip for gardens is very easy 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.680
 take advantage of the savings in time money 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.520
 and water offered by the applications of 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.520
 drip irrigation
