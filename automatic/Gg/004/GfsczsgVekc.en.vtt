00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.750
 so hello everyone knows 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 predator and i'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.649
 increase your soul with mc food like 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.490
 my old technique it does work 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.219
 that I tried these standards so 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 now we can do it with that I 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.119
 find these practices 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's simple after that because there is the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 stung fashion than what I had said that 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 just to increase your fps it's not going 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.219
 increase your soul but normally 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 nothing with pics you must have had 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.469
 to spit tof - it's May 15 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 to put popes textures in 512 then 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.450
 i will show you on minecraft if 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450
 you launch it base 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.510
 okay 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.030
 you can see the ja 910 and mme bello 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.840
 I was leaving 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.520
 so to do it with her 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.520
 pastures wanted to launch already 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.160
 that's not true after you 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.290
 go to options and there you have java 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.300
 eps to lisa and this is it you put this 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.840
 that you want but well after that depends 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.210
 of your soul 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.460
 you 're not going to put kind of wolf friend 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.080
 while you only have two dramas 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.280
 who put us the cereals so me 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.380
 I put four mines because of hump 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.480
 I was hot but my 4000 find 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.510
 already his bubbles normally for a game 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.430
 like minecraft so to examine what 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.230
 you want to have the game 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 and you did is it hatch 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.930
 there it launches minecraft with the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.470
 settings of his pastures you will see 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.470
 trek 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.060
 the ola you see you have 3555 enemies 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 in any case it's 4000 and that's 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.800
 already after that for own tifin 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.870
 added i'll show you glazed then 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.280
 you times the teeth option after when 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.500
 you have installed the options mode 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.050
 graphics and there you see you have the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.010
 mass of parameters you can change 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.170
 and stuff as you by exchanging 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.120
 have you earn a lot of fps 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.019
 after there are other tutoz on the internet 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.860
 where there are guys who say what is 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.200
 this stuff nana there but hey I think 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.350
 that he is really nice for example 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.230
 size distance normally fars it 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.100
 is here and there our arrival here could 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.569
 go to the extreme 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.569
 in short, we have come down well 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.870
 and if you want to put a pack 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.640
 textures in 512 need to put it from 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.890
 by then two weights two pack textures 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.190
 who makes you on the menu that will serve you 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.510
 go hook anyway if you have 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.160
 clerk of the ram and more 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.090
 after if you like the paddle and more 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.190
 normally you can put it to 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.090
 starting from one and the best really is 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.090
 to put it from there 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.769
 so here I hope it will have you 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.489
 helped then i would tell you the next 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.489
