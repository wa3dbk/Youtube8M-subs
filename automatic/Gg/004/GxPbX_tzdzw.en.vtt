00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and plug into your solid state drive so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.670 
and plug into your solid state drive so
that<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.900> actually<00:00:22.020> connect<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that you can actually connect it to the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.120 
that you can actually connect it to the
logic<00:00:22.980> board<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.369> your<00:00:23.789> mac<00:00:23.970> mini<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:25.130> before

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
logic board of your mac mini now before

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
logic board of your mac mini now before
i<00:00:26.160> did<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.460> i<00:00:26.699> went<00:00:27.000> ahead<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> i<00:00:27.599> had

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
i did this i went ahead and i had

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.330 
i did this i went ahead and i had
already<00:00:27.840> opened<00:00:27.960> my<00:00:28.260> mac<00:00:28.439> mini<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.830> previous

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
already opened my mac mini up previous

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
already opened my mac mini up previous
to<00:00:29.429> actually<00:00:29.670> getting<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> SSD<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.599> i<00:00:31.230> ended

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to actually getting the SSD and i ended

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.500 
to actually getting the SSD and i ended
up<00:00:31.560> replacing<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.520> drive<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.180> original

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
up replacing the drive the original

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.760 
up replacing the drive the original
drive<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> came<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> mac<00:00:34.350> mini<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
drive that came with the mac mini and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
drive that came with the mac mini and
putting<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.219> lower<00:00:35.370> bracket<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
putting it in the lower bracket now I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
putting it in the lower bracket now I
did<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.230> knew<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> would<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
did this because I knew it would make it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
did this because I knew it would make it
a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.040> easier<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.879> ahead<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.360> actually

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
a lot easier to go ahead and actually

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.900 
a lot easier to go ahead and actually
pop<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> SSD<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.649> there<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> came<00:00:41.219> so

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pop the SSD in there when it came so

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.670 
pop the SSD in there when it came so
this<00:00:42.360> made<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:42.930> faster<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.440> when<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
this made it a lot faster so when you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.930 
this made it a lot faster so when you
actually<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> might<00:00:44.489> take<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> lot

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
actually do this it might take a lot

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
actually do this it might take a lot
longer<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.750> either<00:00:46.230> way<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> pretty<00:00:46.860> easy

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
longer but either way it's a pretty easy

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
longer but either way it's a pretty easy
process<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> whole<00:00:48.480> thing

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
process you have to take the whole thing

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.729 
process you have to take the whole thing
apart<00:00:48.870> though<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.620> bit

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
apart though so it's a little bit

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
apart though so it's a little bit
intimidating<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.910> once<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.300> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
intimidating but once you do that you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
intimidating but once you do that you
just<00:00:51.570> screw<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.050> grommets<00:00:52.410> into<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.860> SSD

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
just screw your grommets into your SSD

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
just screw your grommets into your SSD
or<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.789> HDD<00:00:54.180> where<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.570> put<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.840> there

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
or your HDD where did we put in there

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
or your HDD where did we put in there
and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.770> ahead<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:55.980> connect<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and you go ahead and connect it to the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.060 
and you go ahead and connect it to the
logic<00:00:56.910> board<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.750> easy<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
logic board and it's as easy as that so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
logic board and it's as easy as that so
once<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.280> done<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:00.270> ahead<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
once that done you can go ahead and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
once that done you can go ahead and
close<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.260> Mac<00:01:01.410> Mini<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.710> you're<00:01:02.250> pretty

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
close up your Mac Mini and you're pretty

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
close up your Mac Mini and you're pretty
much<00:01:02.489> set<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> go<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.780> after<00:01:03.899> loading<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
much set to go so after loading the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
much set to go so after loading the
operating<00:01:04.650> system<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.280> everything

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
operating system on here and everything

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
operating system on here and everything
I<00:01:05.700> did<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> speedtest<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.720> getting<00:01:06.960> some

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I did a speedtest and I'm getting some

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.390 
I did a speedtest and I'm getting some
pretty<00:01:07.229> ridiculous<00:01:07.710> speeds<00:01:07.890> although

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
pretty ridiculous speeds although

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.910 
pretty ridiculous speeds although
they're<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.790> speeds<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.270> advertised<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
they're not the speeds as advertised I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
they're not the speeds as advertised I
went<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> enclosed<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.210> applications

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
went to enclosed out all my applications

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
went to enclosed out all my applications
and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.619> everything<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.220> was

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and you know everything that was

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.380 
and you know everything that was
downloading<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.939> everything<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.299> was

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
downloading and everything that was
copying<00:01:15.689> over<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.110> whatnot<00:01:16.380> ended<00:01:16.920> up

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
copying over and whatnot ended up

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
copying over and whatnot ended up
getting<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:18.119> good<00:01:18.180> speeds<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:18.810> 400

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
getting pretty good speeds I got 400

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.399 
getting pretty good speeds I got 400
megabytes<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:19.890> 460<00:01:20.850> megabytes<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.750> it's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
megabytes and then 460 megabytes so it's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
megabytes and then 460 megabytes so it's
not<00:01:22.619> terrible<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.610> advertised

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
not terrible but it's not as advertised

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.380 
not terrible but it's not as advertised
now<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.470> remember<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:26.070> older<00:01:26.430> videos<00:01:26.460> from

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
now if you remember my older videos from

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
now if you remember my older videos from
benchmarks<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.170> raised<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> ball<00:01:29.070> on

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
benchmarks I raised the ball on

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
benchmarks I raised the ball on
benchmarks<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.180> 932<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
benchmarks a lot and one from 932 to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.460 
benchmarks a lot and one from 932 to
1100<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> dot<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.600> big<00:01:33.869> jump<00:01:34.140> with

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
1100 on the dot which is a big jump with

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
1100 on the dot which is a big jump with
the<00:01:34.680> SSD<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.130> ram<00:01:35.430> upgrade<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> want

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the SSD and ram upgrade now if you want

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.960 
the SSD and ram upgrade now if you want
to<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:36.990> further<00:01:37.290> in-depth<00:01:37.740> video<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.400> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
to see further in-depth video of you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
to see further in-depth video of you
know<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.509> benchmarks<00:01:39.930> were<00:01:40.020> there's<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
know what my benchmarks were there's a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830 
know what my benchmarks were there's a
video<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.520> um<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
video right there but um we're going to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
video right there but um we're going to
go<00:01:42.930> ahead<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> classic<00:01:43.979> boot<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.460> test

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
go ahead and do the classic boot up test

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
go ahead and do the classic boot up test
and<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.299> ended<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.720> taking<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.710> about

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and this ended up taking you know about

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
and this ended up taking you know about
18<00:01:47.369> seconds<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.420> ahead

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
18 seconds it's just going to go ahead

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.630 
18 seconds it's just going to go ahead
and<00:01:48.869> count<00:01:49.140> through<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.649> boot<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.009> but

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and count through it and boot it up but

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
and count through it and boot it up but
previously<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.630> old<00:01:51.840> hard<00:01:52.079> drive

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
previously this with my old hard drive

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
previously this with my old hard drive
which<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> 5400<00:01:53.040> RPM<00:01:53.549> drive<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.939> took<00:01:54.090> over<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
which is 5400 RPM drive it took over a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
which is 5400 RPM drive it took over a
minute<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> boot<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
minute to boot up so this is you know a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
minute to boot up so this is you know a
great<00:01:56.729> improvement<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.540> overall<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> would

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
great improvement and overall I would

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
great improvement and overall I would
say<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:59.009> solid-state<00:01:59.460> drive<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> probably<00:02:00.240> one

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
say a solid-state drive is probably one

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.880 
say a solid-state drive is probably one
of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.719> best<00:02:00.960> things<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of the best things you can do to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
of the best things you can do to
instantly<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.149> upgrade<00:02:03.540> any<00:02:03.869> computer

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
instantly you know upgrade any computer

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
instantly you know upgrade any computer
it<00:02:04.469> makes<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.280> faster<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.850> day<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it makes it so much faster it's day and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.229 
it makes it so much faster it's day and
night<00:02:06.240> faster<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> can't

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
night faster and you know you can't

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
night faster and you know you can't
really<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> until<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.679> get<00:02:10.800> an<00:02:10.890> SSD

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
really know that until you get an SSD

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.280 
really know that until you get an SSD
but<00:02:12.000> anyway<00:02:12.239> guys<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.420> about<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:12.989> for<00:02:13.110> this
