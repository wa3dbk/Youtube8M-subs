00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.960 
bit about this blade it does have a flat
face<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.530> be<00:01:00.739> pretty<00:01:00.979> interesting<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:01.580> know

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
face so be pretty interesting to know

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.149 
face so be pretty interesting to know
from<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.180> punters<00:01:02.659> if<00:01:02.870> offenders<00:01:03.739> stress<00:01:03.979> in

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
from the punters if offenders stress in

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.580 
from the punters if offenders stress in
fact<00:01:04.430> was<00:01:04.610> using<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:04.970> flat<00:01:05.210> face<00:01:05.479> back<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.500> it

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
fact was using a flat face back but it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.000 
fact was using a flat face back but it
does<00:01:06.740> have<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:06.950> big<00:01:07.220> banana<00:01:07.580> bow<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.150> as<00:01:08.299> well

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
does have a big banana bow in it as well

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.560 
does have a big banana bow in it as well
and<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.460> looking<00:01:10.790> at<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.030> edges<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.450> actually

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and so looking at the edges I actually

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.510 
and so looking at the edges I actually
measured<00:01:11.960> them<00:01:12.080> before<00:01:12.440> quite<00:01:13.430> an

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
measured them before quite an

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.950 
measured them before quite an
interesting<00:01:13.760> thing<00:01:14.180> on<00:01:14.299> this<00:01:14.390> fact<00:01:14.690> is<00:01:14.869> that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
interesting thing on this fact is that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560 
interesting thing on this fact is that
his<00:01:15.619> outside<00:01:16.130> edge<00:01:16.310> on<00:01:16.549> this<00:01:17.060> particular<00:01:17.330> bad

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
his outside edge on this particular bad

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.870 
his outside edge on this particular bad
as<00:01:17.689> close<00:01:17.899> to<00:01:18.049> 40<00:01:18.320> millimeters<00:01:18.520> his<00:01:19.520> inside

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
as close to 40 millimeters his inside

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.490 
as close to 40 millimeters his inside
edge<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.270> about<00:01:20.509> 35<00:01:21.079> millimeters<00:01:22.060> with<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.500> I'd

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
edge is about 35 millimeters with a I'd

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.830 
edge is about 35 millimeters with a I'd
say<00:01:24.829> a<00:01:24.859> medium<00:01:25.820> amount<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:26.210> con<00:01:26.420> cable<00:01:26.750> on<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
say a medium amount of con cable on the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.450 
say a medium amount of con cable on the
back<00:01:27.020> looking<00:01:27.320> at<00:01:27.409> about<00:01:27.590> five<00:01:27.920> millimeter

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
back looking at about five millimeter

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.700 
back looking at about five millimeter
scallop<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.689> that's<00:01:29.869> basically<00:01:30.020> if<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:30.530> take

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
scallop so that's basically if you take

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.859 
scallop so that's basically if you take
a<00:01:30.740> ruler<00:01:31.009> from<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.670> spine<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.479> edge<00:01:32.630> and

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
a ruler from the spine to the edge and

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.770 
a ruler from the spine to the edge and
how<00:01:33.829> far<00:01:34.130> down<00:01:34.369> does<00:01:34.579> that<00:01:34.850> come<00:01:35.329> caving<00:01:35.570> got

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
how far down does that come caving got

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.480 
how far down does that come caving got
about<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:35.960> five<00:01:36.229> millimeter<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.250> this

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
about a five millimeter on that and this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.130 
about a five millimeter on that and this
particular<00:01:37.789> bad<00:01:38.090> has<00:01:38.240> got<00:01:38.420> about<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.689> medium

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
particular bad has got about a medium

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.440 
particular bad has got about a medium
medium-low<00:01:39.740> sweet<00:01:40.219> spot<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.579> fact<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.329> it's

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
medium-low sweet spot in fact so it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.630 
medium-low sweet spot in fact so it's
going<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.600> be<00:01:41.689> really<00:01:41.869> good<00:01:42.170> for<00:01:42.490> front<00:01:43.490> for

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
going to be really good for front for

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.779 
going to be really good for front for
players<00:01:44.020> but<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.619> spine<00:01:45.890> does<00:01:46.159> carry<00:01:46.429> all<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
players but the spine does carry all the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.219 
players but the spine does carry all the
way<00:01:46.880> up<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.090> blades<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.689> doesn't<00:01:48.079> help

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
way up the blades so that doesn't help

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.529 
way up the blades so that doesn't help
extend<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.829> sweet<00:01:49.130> spot<00:01:49.249> up<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:50.299> face<00:01:50.509> of

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
extend that sweet spot up the face of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.660 
extend that sweet spot up the face of
the<00:01:50.780> bets<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.320> it's<00:01:51.979> going<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.219> make<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.369> little

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the bets so it's going to make a little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.639 
the bets so it's going to make a little
bit<00:01:52.759> bigger<00:01:52.999> let<00:01:53.810> me<00:01:53.899> balance<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.229> ball<00:01:54.380> on<00:01:54.439> in

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
bit bigger let me balance a ball on in

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.069 
bit bigger let me balance a ball on in
