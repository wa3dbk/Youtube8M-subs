00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.320 

so<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.020> Denise

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
she's just not able to abduct I would

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.120 
she's just not able to abduct I would
hope<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.160> pretty<00:02:09.759> good<00:02:09.960> okay<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.890> think

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
hope that pretty good okay so I think

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.280 
hope that pretty good okay so I think
this<00:02:12.400> technique<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:13.060> shoulder<00:02:13.330> spike<00:02:13.720> is

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
this technique this shoulder spike is

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.660 
this technique this shoulder spike is
way<00:02:14.620> better<00:02:14.920> when<00:02:15.220> you're<00:02:15.340> dealing<00:02:15.640> with

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
way better when you're dealing with

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
way better when you're dealing with
patients<00:02:16.240> on<00:02:16.360> an<00:02:16.750> expedition<00:02:17.410> or<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.800> an

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
patients on an expedition or in an

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.950 
patients on an expedition or in an
active<00:02:18.490> kind<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.820> outdoor<00:02:19.120> thing<00:02:19.420> where

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
active kind of outdoor thing where

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.260 
active kind of outdoor thing where
patients<00:02:20.380> need<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.800> remain<00:02:21.100> active<00:02:21.370> nothing

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
patients need to remain active nothing

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.180 
patients need to remain active nothing
makes<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.570> patient<00:02:22.780> more<00:02:23.170> insecure<00:02:23.710> than

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
makes a patient more insecure than
