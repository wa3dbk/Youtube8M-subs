00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
showing you how to use isolated storage

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.750 
showing you how to use isolated storage
systems<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.959> very<00:03:43.229> very<00:03:43.440> basic<00:03:43.829> level<00:03:43.859> so

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
systems on a very very basic level so

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.879 
systems on a very very basic level so
that<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.060> could<00:03:45.269> take<00:03:45.540> content<00:03:46.199> from<00:03:46.709> one

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.640 
that you could take content from one
page<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:48.449> could<00:03:48.599> save<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.049> into<00:03:49.229> the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
page and you could save it into the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.710 
page and you could save it into the
isolated<00:03:50.040> storage<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.239> use<00:03:51.479> it<00:03:51.599> on

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
isolated storage and you can use it on

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.629 
isolated storage and you can use it on
other<00:03:51.900> pages<00:03:52.109> so<00:03:52.889> that'll<00:03:53.280> be<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.459> my<00:03:53.519> next
