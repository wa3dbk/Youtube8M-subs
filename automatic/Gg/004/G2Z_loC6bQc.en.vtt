I've played a Call of Duty games while I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
I've played a Call of Duty games while I
can<00:01:54.450> remember<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.710> it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
can remember which one is I think it's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
can remember which one is I think it's
ecology<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> sued<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> big<00:01:57.240> red<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
ecology it sued the big red one and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.499 
ecology it sued the big red one and
that's<00:01:58.829> very<00:01:59.640> similar<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> middle<00:02:00.450> of

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that's very similar to the middle of

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
that's very similar to the middle of
Honor<00:02:00.659> games<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.890> first-person

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
Honor games it's it's the first-person

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.980

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
shooter takes place in World War two and
I<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.680> enjoyed<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.430> thought

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
I really enjoyed that one so I thought

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.540 
I really enjoyed that one so I thought
I'd<00:02:05.700> give<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.149> another<00:02:06.299> try<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.550> since

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I'd give this one another try and since

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.900 
I'd give this one another try and since
it<00:02:08.670> only<00:02:08.759> costs<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.300> 99p

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
it only costs like 99p

good<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.610> I<00:03:00.150> thought<00:03:01.050> I'd<00:03:01.170> give<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.440> one<00:03:01.590> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
good so I thought I'd give this one a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.330 
good so I thought I'd give this one a
shower<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:03.990> basically<00:03:04.410> another<00:03:04.620> blind

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
shower so it's basically another blind

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.820 
shower so it's basically another blind
buyer<00:03:05.610> suppose<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:07.230> looks<00:03:07.380> like<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> could<00:03:07.800> be

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
buyer suppose it looks like it could be

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.760 
buyer suppose it looks like it could be
pretty<00:03:07.920> good<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.970> again<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.480> 99p<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:12.770> nice
