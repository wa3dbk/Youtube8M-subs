00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
thing about that so the reason why we

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.300 
thing about that so the reason why we
create<00:01:01.840> devious<00:01:02.170> rose<00:01:02.410> because<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.100> thought

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
create devious rose because we thought

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.120 
create devious rose because we thought
that<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.809> was<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.290> lack<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:06.810> natural<00:01:08.130> way

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
that there was a lack of a natural way

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.130 
that there was a lack of a natural way
for<00:01:09.159> people<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.820> put<00:01:10.030> on<00:01:10.119> muscle<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.659> industry

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
for people to put on muscle in industry

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.510 
for people to put on muscle in industry
so<00:01:11.409> when<00:01:11.619> we<00:01:11.740> first<00:01:11.979> create<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.340> we

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
so when we first create this we

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.460 
so when we first create this we
formulated<00:01:12.939> a<00:01:13.030> couple<00:01:13.330> years<00:01:13.540> ago<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:14.020> actually

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
formulated a couple years ago I actually

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.169 
formulated a couple years ago I actually
first<00:01:14.799> heard<00:01:15.100> about<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.340> when<00:01:15.609> i<00:01:15.640> was<00:01:15.850> living

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
first heard about it when i was living

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.490 
first heard about it when i was living
in<00:01:16.359> korea

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
in korea

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.980 
in korea
and<00:01:17.680> over<00:01:18.160> there<00:01:18.310> they<00:01:18.490> use<00:01:18.790> gentler<00:01:19.630> velvet

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
and over there they use gentler velvet

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.990 
and over there they use gentler velvet
as<00:01:20.230> a<00:01:20.620> awesome<00:01:21.250> immune<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.730> into<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
as a awesome immune going into the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.480 
as a awesome immune going into the
winter<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:22.630> what<00:01:22.840> they'll<00:01:23.020> do<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.500> they'll

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
winter so what they'll do is they'll

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.670 
winter so what they'll do is they'll
take<00:01:24.760> it<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.480> boost<00:01:25.870> their<00:01:25.990> immune<00:01:26.050> system<00:01:26.560> so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
take it to boost their immune system so

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.200 
take it to boost their immune system so
they<00:01:26.770> don't<00:01:26.920> get<00:01:26.979> 6<00:01:27.250> out<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.400> winter<00:01:27.670> well

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
they don't get 6 out the winter well

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.790 
they don't get 6 out the winter well
they<00:01:28.540> did<00:01:28.720> clinical<00:01:29.110> studies<00:01:29.410> on<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.740> they

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
they did clinical studies on it and they

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.730 
they did clinical studies on it and they
found<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.810> increases<00:01:31.810> your<00:01:32.200> natural<00:01:32.590> HGH

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
levels as well as that's a lot of

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.560 
levels as well as that's a lot of
regenerative<00:01:35.020> benefits<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.790> now<00:01:37.390> this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
regenerative benefits so now this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.480 
regenerative benefits so now this
doesn't<00:01:37.810> because<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.950> one<00:01:39.160> thing<00:01:39.369> about

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490

this is a natural HGH booster so what's

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.370 
this is a natural HGH booster so what's
the<00:01:50.140> difference<00:01:50.320> between<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.509> two<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
the difference between the two so the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.660 
the difference between the two so the
difference<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.710> when<00:01:53.920> we<00:01:54.009> first<00:01:54.220> launched

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
difference is when we first launched

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.790 
difference is when we first launched
deer<00:01:55.420> antler<00:01:55.600> velvet<00:01:55.630> wasn't<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> group<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.560> want

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
about three months ago and the reason

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.590 
about three months ago and the reason

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
the whole realest thing is he didn't

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.890 
the whole realest thing is he didn't
necessarily<00:04:40.460> take<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.240> put<00:04:41.389> on<00:04:41.479> muscle<00:04:41.690> I

mean a few scenery looks he's sort of
muscling<00:04:44.600> in<00:04:45.080> any<00:04:45.620> way<00:04:45.800> but<00:04:45.860> he<00:04:46.550> was<00:04:46.669> taking<00:04:47.000> it

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
muscling in any way but he was taking it

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.150

because he had torn his tricep right and
what<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:50.000> most<00:04:50.389> known<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.460> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
what this is most known for is the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.760 
what this is most known for is the
regenerative<00:04:52.789> benefits<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.690> it's<00:04:54.110> deer

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
regenerative benefits so it's deer

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
amino acids they have really good joint

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.800 
amino acids they have really good joint
support<00:05:03.620> so<00:05:03.860> they<00:05:03.889> have<00:05:04.240> natural<00:05:05.240> sources<00:05:05.690> of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
support so they have natural sources of

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.560 
support so they have natural sources of
glucosamine<00:05:06.440> chondroitin<00:05:06.979> sulfate<00:05:07.669> so

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
glucosamine chondroitin sulfate so

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.570

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
there has glutamine in it and so he was

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.170 
there has glutamine in it and so he was
