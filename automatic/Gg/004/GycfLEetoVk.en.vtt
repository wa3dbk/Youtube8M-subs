how<00:00:03.659> much<00:00:03.870> fertilizer<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.740> too<00:00:05.220> much<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.759> corn

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
how much fertilizer is too much in corn

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.090 
how much fertilizer is too much in corn
well<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.750> know<00:00:06.870> what<00:00:07.080> when<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.589> comes<00:00:07.770> down<00:00:07.980> to

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
well you know what when it comes down to

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.800 
well you know what when it comes down to
economics<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.760> year<00:00:09.060> you<00:00:09.480> may<00:00:09.630> have<00:00:09.780> a

economics this year you may have a
different<00:00:10.170> answer<00:00:10.320> than<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.620> had<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> year<00:00:11.100> ago

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
different answer than you had a year ago

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640 
different answer than you had a year ago
but<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.120> want<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.390> talk<00:00:12.510> about<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.900> safety<00:00:13.200> -

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
but we want to talk about the safety -

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.710 
but we want to talk about the safety -
of<00:00:13.830> different<00:00:14.160> fertilizers<00:00:14.570> talking<00:00:15.570> about

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
of different fertilizers talking about

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.330 
of different fertilizers talking about
the<00:00:15.840> salt<00:00:16.170> load<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.740> looking<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the salt load and looking at the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.740 
the salt load and looking at the
placement<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.940> where<00:00:18.000> you're<00:00:18.330> actually

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
placement of where you're actually

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.300 
placement of where you're actually
putting<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.170> fertilizer<00:00:19.590> yep<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.010> here's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
putting this fertilizer yep and here's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.100 
putting this fertilizer yep and here's
really<00:00:20.580> our<00:00:20.910> concern<00:00:21.360> there<00:00:21.810> are<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> lot<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
really our concern there are a lot of

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.779 
really our concern there are a lot of
people<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.560> there<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.280> take<00:00:23.490> old

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
people out there that will just take old

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
people out there that will just take old
10:34<00:00:24.750> old<00:00:24.930> liquid<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.530> they'll<00:00:25.740> throw<00:00:26.010> five

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
10:34 old liquid and they'll throw five

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.640 
10:34 old liquid and they'll throw five
gallons<00:00:27.030> eight<00:00:27.270> gallons<00:00:27.480> even<00:00:27.900> ten<00:00:28.140> gallons

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
gallons eight gallons even ten gallons

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.640 
gallons eight gallons even ten gallons
right<00:00:29.280> in<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.850> first<00:00:30.210> row<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.930> don't<00:00:31.289> give<00:00:31.530> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
right in the first row and don't give it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410 
right in the first row and don't give it
a<00:00:31.710> whole<00:00:31.890> lot<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.219> thought<00:00:32.400> and<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:33.180> they

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
a whole lot of thought and then they

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.210 
a whole lot of thought and then they
wonder<00:00:33.690> why<00:00:33.870> every<00:00:34.440> once<00:00:34.650> in<00:00:34.770> awhile<00:00:34.890> they

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
wonder why every once in awhile they

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.520 
wonder why every once in awhile they
have<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> germination<00:00:36.360> issue<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:37.020> their<00:00:37.200> corn

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
have a germination issue with their corn

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
have a germination issue with their corn
or<00:00:37.860> why<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> corn<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:38.730> come<00:00:38.880> up<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.239> some<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
or why the corn will come up and some of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
or why the corn will come up and some of
the<00:00:39.570> plants<00:00:39.810> will<00:00:40.050> start<00:00:40.470> to<00:00:40.590> buggy<00:00:40.860> whip<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the plants will start to buggy whip and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
the plants will start to buggy whip and
it<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.820> looks<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> mess<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.720> there

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it just looks like a mess out there

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
it just looks like a mess out there
what's<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.950> what's<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.399> problem<00:00:44.820> well

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
what's going on what's the problem well

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.490 
what's going on what's the problem well
whenever<00:00:45.600> you're<00:00:45.870> putting<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.470> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
whenever you're putting a lot of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.830 
whenever you're putting a lot of
fertilizer<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.250> close<00:00:47.850> proximity<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.630> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
fertilizer in close proximity to the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
fertilizer in close proximity to the
seed<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.250> taking<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.090> risk

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
seed you're really taking a lot of risk

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
seed you're really taking a lot of risk
whether<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> realize<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.680> may

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
whether you realize it or not you may

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.020 
whether you realize it or not you may
say<00:00:53.040> you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.280> what<00:00:53.460> I've<00:00:53.640> done<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:53.969> for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
say you know what I've done this for

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.120 
say you know what I've done this for
five<00:00:54.450> years<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:55.020> ten<00:00:55.200> years<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.010> really

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
five years or ten years and I really

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.010 
five years or ten years and I really
haven't<00:00:56.550> seen<00:00:56.700> much<00:00:56.910> trouble<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
haven't seen much trouble then all of a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.110 
haven't seen much trouble then all of a
sudden<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> weather<00:00:59.040> extreme<00:00:59.730> where

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
sudden you get a weather extreme where

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
sudden you get a weather extreme where
you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.930> bit<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.170> moisture<00:01:01.320> out

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you get a little bit of moisture out

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
you get a little bit of moisture out
there<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:02.700> much<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
there but not very much and all of a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
there but not very much and all of a
sudden<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.409> fertilizer<00:01:05.039> with<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.429> that<00:01:05.609> salt

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
sudden the fertilizer with all that salt

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.609 
sudden the fertilizer with all that salt
is<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> attract<00:01:06.899> some<00:01:07.170> moisture<00:01:07.530> away

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
is going to attract some moisture away

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.709 
is going to attract some moisture away
from<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> seed<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.549> could<00:01:09.090> end<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.359> with<00:01:09.539> some

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
from the seed you could end up with some

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.359 
from the seed you could end up with some
issues<00:01:09.840> yeah<00:01:10.289> especially<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.069> drier

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
issues yeah especially in the drier

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
issues yeah especially in the drier
Springs<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.179> we<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.929> don't

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
Springs is when we see this and I don't

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
Springs is when we see this and I don't
care<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.679> you've<00:01:13.829> been<00:01:13.859> putting<00:01:14.159> ten<00:01:14.490> gallons

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
care if you've been putting ten gallons

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.639 
care if you've been putting ten gallons
at<00:01:14.939> ten<00:01:15.119> thirty<00:01:15.270> 400<00:01:15.719> on<00:01:15.899> for<00:01:16.139> the<00:01:16.200> last<00:01:16.409> ten

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
at ten thirty 400 on for the last ten

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.859 
at ten thirty 400 on for the last ten
years<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.700> say<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.090> I've<00:01:18.359> always<00:01:18.689> done

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
years and you say well I've always done

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.169 
years and you say well I've always done
it<00:01:18.899> that<00:01:19.049> way<00:01:19.200> yeah<00:01:19.920> maybe<00:01:20.249> you<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.149> how

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
it that way yeah maybe you have but how

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:22.760 
it that way yeah maybe you have but how
much<00:01:21.479> yield<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.959> already<00:01:22.109> lost<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.740> mean

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
much yield have you already lost I mean

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
much yield have you already lost I mean
would<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.159> notice<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> had<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> 500<00:01:24.420> yield

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
would you notice if you had a 500 yield

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.349 
would you notice if you had a 500 yield
loss<00:01:24.990> no<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.709> secondly<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.700> could<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.209> the

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
loss no and secondly this could be the

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.879 
loss no and secondly this could be the
year<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.779> we<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.139> of<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> sudden<00:01:28.499> have<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.649> dry

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
you know we all think that Oh having

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.719 
you know we all think that Oh having
more<00:01:37.049> plant<00:01:37.349> food<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.709> there's<00:01:37.950> great<00:01:38.219> well

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
more plant food out there's great well

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.879 
more plant food out there's great well
it<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.359> but<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.109> got<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.380> place<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
it is but you got to place it in the

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:42.769 
it is but you got to place it in the
right<00:01:41.009> spot<00:01:41.249> and<00:01:41.459> what<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.819> comes<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.359> to

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:42.779 
right spot and what it all comes back to

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:45.889 
right spot and what it all comes back to
is<00:01:42.990> salt<00:01:43.679> so<00:01:44.159> how<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.639> salt<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.389> we<00:01:45.689> willing

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is salt so how much salt are we willing

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.199 
is salt so how much salt are we willing
to<00:01:46.049> take<00:01:46.349> in<00:01:46.560> 30<00:01:46.829> inch<00:01:47.039> rows<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.490> an<00:01:47.729> acre<00:01:47.880> if

to take in 30 inch rows on an acre if

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.429 
to take in 30 inch rows on an acre if
you're<00:01:48.389> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.569> put<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.899> fertile<00:01:49.229> what's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
you're going to put it in fertile what's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
you're going to put it in fertile what's
our<00:01:49.590> limit<00:01:49.889> well<00:01:50.249> typically<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.969> just<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
our limit well typically we just like to

our limit well typically we just like to
see<00:01:51.810> no<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.439> than<00:01:52.709> five<00:01:53.009> pounds<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.729> salt<00:01:53.999> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
see no more than five pounds of salt in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.989 
see no more than five pounds of salt in
the<00:01:54.869> furrow<00:01:55.109> on<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.349> thirty<00:01:55.770> inch<00:01:55.889> row<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.639> corn

the furrow on a thirty inch row of corn
with<00:01:57.299> soybeans<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.139> basic<00:01:58.529> can't<00:01:58.770> take<00:01:59.009> hardly

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
starter is whole different than pop up

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.610 
starter is whole different than pop up
in<00:02:41.310> my<00:02:41.340> book<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.090> when<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:42.750> talk<00:02:42.960> about<00:02:42.990> starter

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
in my book so when we talk about starter

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170 
in my book so when we talk about starter
fertilizer<00:02:44.070> we're<00:02:44.640> talking<00:02:45.060> about

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
fertilizer we're talking about

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.940 
fertilizer we're talking about
fertilizer<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.410> lets<00:02:46.740> say

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
fertilizer that's going to be lets say

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.280 
fertilizer that's going to be lets say
two<00:02:47.010> by<00:02:47.430> two<00:02:47.490> okay<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.330> 2<00:02:48.570> inches<00:02:49.080> down<00:02:49.230> from

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
two by two okay so 2 inches down from

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
two by two okay so 2 inches down from
the<00:02:49.560> seed<00:02:49.740> 2<00:02:49.890> inches<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.400> side<00:02:50.700> well<00:02:50.970> now

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
the seed 2 inches to the side well now

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.460 
the seed 2 inches to the side well now
you've<00:02:51.270> got<00:02:51.420> some<00:02:51.600> dirt<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.959> buffer<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
you've got some dirt to buffer that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.050 
you've got some dirt to buffer that
fertilizer<00:02:52.920> now<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.550> not<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:53.790> big<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> deal

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
fertilizer now it's not as big a deal

fertilizer now it's not as big a deal
pop<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.959> fertilizer<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.800> what<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.100> would<00:02:56.250> call

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
pop up fertilizer is what we would call

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.250 
pop up fertilizer is what we would call
the<00:02:56.880> stuff<00:02:57.120> that's<00:02:57.330> right<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.690> furrow<00:02:58.020> that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the stuff that's right in furrow that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.350 
the stuff that's right in furrow that
term<00:02:58.800> starter<00:02:59.520> fertilizer<00:02:59.880> gets<00:03:00.030> thrown

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
term starter fertilizer gets thrown

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.480 
term starter fertilizer gets thrown
around<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.170> lot<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.470> ways<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.430> you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
around a lot of ways just so you

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.280 
around a lot of ways just so you
understand<00:03:02.940> what<00:03:03.120> we're<00:03:03.450> talking<00:03:03.959> about<00:03:04.020> when

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
understand what we're talking about when

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.050 
understand what we're talking about when
we<00:03:04.440> say<00:03:04.470> pop-up<00:03:05.130> that's<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.850> furrow

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
we say pop-up that's in the furrow

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.600 
we say pop-up that's in the furrow
starter<00:03:07.020> we're<00:03:07.230> talking<00:03:07.530> about<00:03:07.620> 2<00:03:07.890> by<00:03:08.040> 2<00:03:08.100> okay

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
starter we're talking about 2 by 2 okay

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.460 
starter we're talking about 2 by 2 okay
now<00:03:08.880> once<00:03:09.090> we're<00:03:09.270> talking<00:03:09.600> about<00:03:09.720> starter<00:03:10.290> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
now once we're talking about starter and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080 
now once we're talking about starter and
you're<00:03:10.740> getting<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.130> little<00:03:11.459> bit<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.640> soil

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you're getting that little bit of soil

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.880 
you're getting that little bit of soil
as<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> buffer<00:03:12.870> between<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.290> seed<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
as a buffer between the seed and the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.680 
as a buffer between the seed and the
fertilizer<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> open<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.570> a

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
fertilizer that's going to open up a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.630 
fertilizer that's going to open up a
whole<00:03:15.870> new<00:03:15.900> window<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.400> put

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
whole new window for you and you can put

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.910 
whole new window for you and you can put
on<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> lot<00:03:18.060> more<00:03:18.360> gallons<00:03:18.989> or<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.290> lot<00:03:19.739> more

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
on a lot more gallons or a lot more

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.550 
on a lot more gallons or a lot more
pounds<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.580> dry<00:03:20.910> whichever<00:03:21.450> you're<00:03:21.720> using<00:03:22.019> but

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
pounds of dry whichever you're using but

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.750 
pounds of dry whichever you're using but
you<00:03:22.650> need<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.459> little<00:03:23.580> bit

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
you need to get that just a little bit

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.250 
you need to get that just a little bit
away<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.090> what<00:03:24.390> we've<00:03:24.540> done<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.900> our<00:03:24.989> farm

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
away so what we've done in our farm

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.990 
away so what we've done in our farm
we've<00:03:25.410> cut<00:03:25.650> back<00:03:25.680> how<00:03:26.250> much<00:03:26.459> we're<00:03:26.670> putting<00:03:26.880> in

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
we've cut back how much we're putting in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.759 
we've cut back how much we're putting in
the<00:03:27.120> furrow<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.810> try<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.110> be<00:03:28.200> careful<00:03:28.560> about

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the furrow to try and be careful about

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.190 
the furrow to try and be careful about
overloading<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.640> seed<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.390> salt<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.930> we

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
overloading that seed with salt and we

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.720 
overloading that seed with salt and we
started<00:03:31.530> moving<00:03:31.709> more<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.340> our<00:03:32.489> fertilizer

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
started moving more of our fertilizer

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.630 
started moving more of our fertilizer
out<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.420> side<00:03:33.630> well<00:03:34.019> actually<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:35.280> some<00:03:35.489> of

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
out to the side well actually in some of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.770 
out to the side well actually in some of
the<00:03:35.700> stuff<00:03:35.940> where<00:03:36.120> we're<00:03:36.269> strip<00:03:36.450> tilling

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the stuff where we're strip tilling

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.570 
the stuff where we're strip tilling
we're<00:03:36.930> moving<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.380> not<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.890> side<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.400> it's

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
we're moving it not to the side but it's

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.340 
we're moving it not to the side but it's
directly<00:03:39.090> down<00:03:39.330> below<00:03:39.630> where<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.959> seed<00:03:40.140> will

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
directly down below where the seed will

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.840 
directly down below where the seed will
be<00:03:40.440> planted<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.070> we'll<00:03:41.250> put<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.550> on<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.820> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
be planted and we'll put that on in the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.880 
be planted and we'll put that on in the
fall<00:03:42.090> 8<00:03:42.360> inches<00:03:42.780> below<00:03:42.989> where<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.410> seal<00:03:43.620> get

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
fall 8 inches below where the seal get

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.650 
fall 8 inches below where the seal get
planted<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.489> that's<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:44.940> way<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.510> too

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
planted so that's one way to do it too

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.330 
planted so that's one way to do it too
when<00:03:45.870> you've<00:03:45.959> got<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> lot<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.380> soil<00:03:46.830> there<00:03:47.130> to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
when you've got a lot of soil there to

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.800 
when you've got a lot of soil there to
buffer<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> fertilizer<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.450> put<00:03:48.690> on

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
buffer the fertilizer you can put on

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.050 
buffer the fertilizer you can put on
lots<00:03:49.050> of<00:03:49.230> fertilizer<00:03:49.680> but<00:03:50.340> again<00:03:50.670> if<00:03:50.970> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
lots of fertilizer but again if you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.699 
lots of fertilizer but again if you
don't<00:03:51.239> have<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.720> soil<00:03:52.110> you're<00:03:52.470> putting

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
don't have all that soil you're putting

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.340 
don't have all that soil you're putting
it<00:03:52.830> in<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.070> pop<00:03:53.370> up<00:03:53.580> fashion<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:55.110> you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
it in a pop up fashion you just you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.440 
it in a pop up fashion you just you
can't<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.860> much<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.310> there<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.730> honestly<00:03:57.030> on

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
can't have much in there and honestly on

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.420 
can't have much in there and honestly on
our<00:03:57.600> trials<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.200> our<00:03:58.320> farm<00:03:58.620> we've<00:03:58.890> done<00:03:59.160> better

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
our trials on our farm we've done better

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.790 
our trials on our farm we've done better
with<00:03:59.730> 10:34<00:04:00.390> Oh<00:04:00.420> only<00:04:00.720> putting<00:04:01.110> a<00:04:01.260> gallon<00:04:01.680> on

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
with 10:34 Oh only putting a gallon on

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.470 
with 10:34 Oh only putting a gallon on
and<00:04:02.130> putting<00:04:02.370> some<00:04:02.519> micronutrients<00:04:03.180> with<00:04:03.330> it

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
and putting some micronutrients with it

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.180 
and putting some micronutrients with it
then<00:04:03.660> by<00:04:03.959> putting<00:04:04.260> three<00:04:04.440> gallons<00:04:04.920> or<00:04:05.010> five

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
then by putting three gallons or five

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.040 
then by putting three gallons or five
gallons<00:04:05.640> on<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.090> we<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.630> look<00:04:06.780> at<00:04:06.870> our<00:04:06.930> own

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
gallons on so we just look at our own

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.440 
gallons on so we just look at our own
data<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.709> our<00:04:07.739> farm<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.370> say<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:09.060> know<00:04:09.209> I

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
data on our farm and say you know I

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.420 
data on our farm and say you know I
think<00:04:09.510> putting<00:04:10.080> more<00:04:10.290> fertilizer<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:11.220> is

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
think putting more fertilizer on is

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.970 
think putting more fertilizer on is
actually<00:04:11.970> hurting<00:04:12.480> us<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:12.959> some<00:04:13.200> cases<00:04:13.680> well

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
actually hurting us in some cases well

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.380 
actually hurting us in some cases well
we<00:04:14.130> get<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.280> lot<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.610> questions<00:04:14.850> from<00:04:15.299> people

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
we get a lot of questions from people

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.599 
we get a lot of questions from people
and<00:04:15.780> say<00:04:15.900> oh<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.380> guys<00:04:16.560> are<00:04:16.830> our<00:04:17.190> fertilizer

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
and say oh you guys are our fertilizer

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.120 
and say oh you guys are our fertilizer
experts<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.780> don't<00:04:19.109> know<00:04:19.380> all<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.590> stuff

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
experts and I don't know all that stuff

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.710 
experts and I don't know all that stuff
I<00:04:20.430> don't<00:04:20.459> know<00:04:20.880> how<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.030> make<00:04:21.180> those<00:04:21.390> decisions

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720

fertilizer don't just ask how many

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.710 
fertilizer don't just ask how many
pounds<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.210> nitrogen

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720

start<00:04:31.920> talking<00:04:32.280> about<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.760> salt<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.360> how

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
start talking about the salt and how

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.210 
start talking about the salt and how
much<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:33.810> safe<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.260> have<00:04:34.410> close<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.980> seed

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
much is safe to have close to the seed

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.350 
much is safe to have close to the seed
and<00:04:35.460> these<00:04:35.610> kind<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.910> things<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.330> can

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
and these kind of things so you can

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.150 
and these kind of things so you can
actually<00:04:36.870> compare<00:04:37.230> products<00:04:37.680> because<00:04:38.010> there

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
actually compare products because there

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.620 
actually compare products because there
really<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> lot<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:39.030> difference<00:04:39.390> in<00:04:39.540> the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
really is a lot of difference in the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.550 
really is a lot of difference in the

you can actually have some yield gain
and<00:05:28.110> especially<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.770> can<00:05:28.890> have<00:05:29.040> drier<00:05:29.250> corn

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580
