metabolic enhancement training and what

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.250 
metabolic enhancement training and what
it<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> circuit<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.210> four<00:00:18.539> movements<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it is is a circuit of four movements and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
it is is a circuit of four movements and
you're<00:00:19.500> cycling<00:00:19.949> between<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.430> lower<00:00:20.760> body

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you're cycling between a lower body

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.390 
you're cycling between a lower body
movement<00:00:21.300> into<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:22.800> upper<00:00:22.980> body<00:00:23.100> movement

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
movement into an upper body movement

compare<00:00:34.200> them<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> circuit<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> first

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
compare them for a circuit so the first

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670 
compare them for a circuit so the first
exercise<00:00:36.390> no<00:00:36.930> one's<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> an

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
exercise no one's going to do is an

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.100 
exercise no one's going to do is an
alternating<00:00:38.399> forward<00:00:38.910> lunge<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.780> she's<00:00:39.989> going

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
alternating forward lunge so she's going

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.360 
alternating forward lunge so she's going
to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.350> their<00:00:40.469> hands<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.829> their<00:00:40.950> hips<00:00:41.100> if

to do with their hands on their hips if
this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> too<00:00:41.940> easy<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.690> always

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this is too easy for you you can always

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.779 
this is too easy for you you can always
grab<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> pair<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.469> dumbbells<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.040> increase

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
grab a pair of dumbbells and increase

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.340 
grab a pair of dumbbells and increase
the<00:00:44.910> intensity<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.510> increasing<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> weight

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the intensity by increasing the weight

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
the intensity by increasing the weight

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
forward lunge that was her lower body

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.030 
forward lunge that was her lower body
movement<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.659> next<00:01:07.020> movement<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.979> be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
movement the next movement is gonna be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.200 
movement the next movement is gonna be
an<00:01:08.130> upper<00:01:08.340> body<00:01:08.520> movement<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.060> go

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
an upper body movement we're gonna go

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
an upper body movement we're gonna go
into<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> push-up<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.470> she's<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
into a push-up so she's just going to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
into a push-up so she's just going to
drop<00:01:11.130> onto<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> ground<00:01:11.729> writes<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> push-up

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
drop onto the ground writes that push-up

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.359 
drop onto the ground writes that push-up
position<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.650> she's<00:01:13.830> gonna<00:01:13.920> bang<00:01:14.189> out

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
position and then she's gonna bang out

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.240 
position and then she's gonna bang out
20<00:01:15.000> push-ups<00:01:15.240> okay<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:16.979> save

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
20 push-ups okay just we're gonna save

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
20 push-ups okay just we're gonna save
time<00:01:17.280> she's<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.420> 20<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.229> as

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
time she's not going to do all 20 but as

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
time she's not going to do all 20 but as
soon<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.560> she<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> 20<00:01:20.250> push-ups<00:01:20.490> she

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
soon as she got the 20 push-ups she

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.600 
soon as she got the 20 push-ups she
would<00:01:20.939> come<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.340> now<00:01:23.340> she's<00:01:23.549> gonna

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
would come back up and now she's gonna

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
would come back up and now she's gonna
