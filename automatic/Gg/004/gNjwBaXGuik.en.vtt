00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.740
 learn to play the game of battle 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.420
 Corsican you have beautiful name of a game of 54 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 cards and to be at least players 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.620
 so it's like a battle 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.890
 normal, that is, we distribute the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.680
 package by removing number of players he 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.869
 so there I am going to distribute in two and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.029
 we will start with thiery card except 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.590
 that it is his turn 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.390
 so the objective of the game is to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
 collect all the cards in one 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.650
 only package so we will start with 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.700
 to play 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.700
 so if it's the right player who 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.260
 starts a few 1.2 so to the players 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.559
 from the left 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.450
 in seven days right reims is my 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.860
 first case is that there are two 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.610
 identical cards of 7 for example so 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.350
 the fota peace on the package like this 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.160
 is the first player who taupe 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 package wins the cards and may 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.829
 in his package then the second 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.159
 game particularity if a player 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.640
 return an ace or a head in this case 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 there the next player will have to put an ace 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.280
 or a head in the next cards 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.909
 so for the assse in the four 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.759
 next cards 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.390
 otherwise the package goes back to the player who has 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.979
 laid down aces or for example him to millas the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 left day at millas so today 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 right returns 1.8 1.6 to 3 and 1 5 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.799
 so there is no head in them 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.869
 four cards proposed by the kind of 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.900
 right all around left wins 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 him to the control if the player on the left 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.750
 but this is the kind of right 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.329
 but my kart an english proves that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.720
 it's a lady so a lady was getting 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.570
 togo day left to put a head 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.100
 or an ace in the next two cards 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 for a lady if it's a valet helping 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.060
 next card 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.700
 a card lady a king three cards 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.320
 and ace four cards 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 so we'll continue the game for 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.520
 see the operation a little so the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.010
 left player a map of cards 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.230
 there is no head weary me so this 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.220
 right now comes back and did 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.830
 pass the player who just won 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:26.450
 more who starts playing at 8.5 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.450
 so 5 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.790
 3 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.800
 so was there a single possibility 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.290
 it's not a head so it comes back for 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.980
 the day 2 left here thank you for having 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.980
