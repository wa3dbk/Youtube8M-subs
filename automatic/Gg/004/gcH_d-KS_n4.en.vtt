which<00:00:21.009> is<00:00:21.130> quite<00:00:21.279> good<00:00:21.550> so<00:00:22.060> movie<00:00:22.300> on<00:00:22.420> so<00:00:22.630> we've

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
which is quite good so movie on so we've

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.070 
which is quite good so movie on so we've
got<00:00:22.840> to<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:23.009> 1017<00:00:24.009> 50k<00:00:24.430> is<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.610> processor<00:00:25.060> now<00:00:25.690> 70

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
got to a 1017 50k is a processor now 70

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.540 
got to a 1017 50k is a processor now 70
or<00:00:26.170> 50<00:00:26.410> case<00:00:26.590> I<00:00:26.770> should<00:00:26.830> quite<00:00:27.010> good<00:00:27.160> processor

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
or 50 case I should quite good processor

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.120 
or 50 case I should quite good processor
it's<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:28.029> quad-core<00:00:28.779> I'm<00:00:29.289> forking<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:29.980> hurts

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
it's a quad-core I'm forking it hurts

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.880 
it's a quad-core I'm forking it hurts
this<00:00:30.279> is<00:00:30.400> really<00:00:30.699> fast<00:00:31.029> my<00:00:31.750> class<00:00:31.930> was<00:00:31.960> 6300

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
this is really fast my class was 6300

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.530 
this is really fast my class was 6300
three<00:00:33.430> point<00:00:33.580> five<00:00:33.670> gigahertz<00:00:33.970> its<00:00:34.360> course

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
three point five gigahertz its course

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.479 
three point five gigahertz its course
got<00:00:34.720> built-in<00:00:36.000> 8670<00:00:37.000> d<00:00:37.239> which<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.489> basically

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
got built-in 8670 d which is basically

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.430 
got built-in 8670 d which is basically
the<00:00:39.730> equivalent<00:00:40.380> 66<00:00:41.380> 67<00:00:42.010> 70<00:00:42.489> so<00:00:43.210> not<00:00:44.020> too<00:00:44.230> bad

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
the equivalent 66 67 70 so not too bad

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.250 
the equivalent 66 67 70 so not too bad
but<00:00:44.680> ok<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:46.149> expect<00:00:46.540> for<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.870> built-in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
but ok what expect for is a built-in

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.340 
but ok what expect for is a built-in
thing<00:00:47.590> it's<00:00:47.770> like<00:00:47.920> d6<00:00:48.399> gt640<00:00:49.120> vivillon<00:00:49.719> we've

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
thing it's like d6 gt640 vivillon we've

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.700 
thing it's like d6 gt640 vivillon we've
got<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.340> ram<00:00:51.520> so<00:00:52.059> we've<00:00:52.210> picked<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.230> corsair

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
got the ram so we've picked the corsair

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.490 
got the ram so we've picked the corsair
ddr3<00:00:54.190> but<00:00:54.670> vengeance<00:00:55.090> jet<00:00:55.600> black<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.110> this<00:00:56.379> is

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
ddr3 but vengeance jet black and this is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.709 
ddr3 but vengeance jet black and this is
X<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.890> P<00:00:57.010> ram<00:00:57.219> now<00:00:57.820> I<00:00:57.850> pic<00:00:58.090> text<00:00:58.360> appear<00:00:58.570> on

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
X and P ram now I pic text appear on

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.860 
X and P ram now I pic text appear on
because<00:00:58.960> it's<00:00:59.079> 50<00:00:59.440> pounds<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.039> 8<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.180> 80<00:01:01.329> 60<00:01:01.600> 61

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
because it's 50 pounds and 8 to 80 60 61

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.120 
because it's 50 pounds and 8 to 80 60 61
is<00:01:02.199> 80<00:01:02.980> pounds<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:04.750> verse<00:01:04.899> 8<00:01:05.110> gigs<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.800> same

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
is 80 pounds so in verse 8 gigs and same

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.950 
is 80 pounds so in verse 8 gigs and same
660<00:01:06.789> no<00:01:06.880> that's<00:01:07.390> not<00:01:07.450> really<00:01:07.660> too<00:01:07.750> much<00:01:07.780> of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
660 no that's not really too much of

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.370 
660 no that's not really too much of
different<00:01:08.320> sir<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:08.740> think<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.640> gaming<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
different sir I think in gaming and this

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.260 
different sir I think in gaming and this
would<00:01:11.500> be<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:11.619> fine<00:01:11.920> also<00:01:12.880> if<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.030> can

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
would be just fine also if you can

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.510 
would be just fine also if you can
upgrade<00:01:13.390> later<00:01:13.720> on<00:01:13.869> too<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.380> yes<00:01:14.860> let's<00:01:15.250> moving

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
upgrade later on too so yes let's moving

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.789 
upgrade later on too so yes let's moving

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
theoretical things are saying that so

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.190 
theoretical things are saying that so
it's<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.759> made<00:01:36.909> sure<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.210> compatible<00:01:37.750> but

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
it's like I made sure the compatible but

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.469 
it's like I made sure the compatible but
I've<00:01:38.560> actually<00:01:38.590> tested<00:01:39.280> myself<00:01:39.400> but<00:01:39.909> I'm<00:01:40.180> just

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
I've actually tested myself but I'm just

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.350 
I've actually tested myself but I'm just
testing<00:01:40.869> from<00:01:41.259> benchmarks<00:01:41.939> moving<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:43.060> we've

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.690 
testing from benchmarks moving on we've
got<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:44.200> hard<00:01:44.650> drive<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.310> pick<00:01:45.520> whatever

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
got the hard drive so you pick whatever

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.580 
got the hard drive so you pick whatever
you<00:01:45.820> want<00:01:45.880> but<00:01:46.210> pick<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.509> 750<00:01:46.930> gig<00:01:47.079> western
