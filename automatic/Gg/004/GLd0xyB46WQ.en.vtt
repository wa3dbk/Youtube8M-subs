00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.180
 if the saddle does not fit that will 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.010
 Cycling to the qual decides often 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.740
 already a centimeter over pain or 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.450
 not pain i will show you today like you 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.879
 adjust your saddle correctly 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.670
 The prerequisite is that you have a wheel 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.470
 whose frame size is watching and the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.339
 Do you need one for that? 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:29.109
 torque wrench a spirit level and 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.680
 a roll trainer a wall or 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.180
 a helper can use a bicycle saddle 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.900
 you move in three directions 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.950
 up and down back and forth and in 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.710
 The inclination of the saddle should be easy 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.260
 to be level 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.180
 now you need the spirit level 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.340
 put the wheel on a smooth floor 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.390
 Both tires should be equally strong 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 be pumped up 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.670
 then the water level would be on the saddle 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.479
 and smells it exactly horizontal as 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.670
 the second lets you change the height 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.830
 you need to now the council trainer 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.690
 if you do not hate the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.090
 turn away or let someone else 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.190
 hold the crank at 6 o'clock 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.700
 position is currently on the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.920
 saddle 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.080
 then the verse turns on the crank 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.650
 when you completely stretched yet 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 reached 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.350
 otherwise, lower or raise the saddle 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.340
 Very important while the hip must always 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 stay level 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.930
 she must not tip to one side 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.870
 seat as a whole on the saddle like you 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.130
 it also exerts rides so do so 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.050
 also in the front the handlebar 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.270
 because that again determines where you are on the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.000
 saddle the main weight is digit 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.890
 crank at 3 o'clock positions sits down 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 Back on the bike this time with the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.110
 Foot pads on the pedals 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.360
 if the imaginary line goes through the knee 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.580
 The footballs runs exactly vertically 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.520
 then you have the right distance from 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.840
 saddle to bottom bracket found test 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.030
 then the height again 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.190
 because the adjustment of the horizontal has 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 influence on the vertical to not 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.970
 had to try a little back and forth 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.280
 if that's right you have a good one 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.379
 starting position for the saddle found 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.920
 from there you can continue to feel 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.920
 optimize
