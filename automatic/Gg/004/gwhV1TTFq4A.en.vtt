your<00:02:03.630> phone<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> same<00:02:05.130> levels<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.759> have

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
your phone it's the same levels I have

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.459 
your phone it's the same levels I have
Rio<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:06.990> why<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.200> looks<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.439> bit

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
Rio here so that's why it looks a bit

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.760 
Rio here so that's why it looks a bit
different<00:02:07.799> than<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> regular<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.770> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
different than the regular one but it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.050 
different than the regular one but it
plays<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.730> fine

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
plays just fine

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
plays just fine
the<00:02:12.360> HD<00:02:12.690> 4000<00:02:13.230> graphics

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the HD 4000 graphics

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.580 
the HD 4000 graphics
the<00:02:14.100> processor<00:02:14.700> great<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.990> I'm<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.200> gonna<00:02:16.319> go

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the processor great so I'm just gonna go

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
the processor great so I'm just gonna go
open<00:02:16.980> up<00:02:17.069> another<00:02:17.310> app<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> fairly

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
open up another app this is a fairly

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.850 
open up another app this is a fairly
intensive<00:02:18.870> app<00:02:19.020> actually<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.560> all<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
intensive app actually of all the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.230 
intensive app actually of all the
settings<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.459> high<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.060> gonna

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
settings that the high in it I'm gonna

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880 
settings that the high in it I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> second<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.709> is

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
demonstrate that in a second but this is

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.130 
demonstrate that in a second but this is
a<00:02:22.920> bus<00:02:23.160> driver<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.270> essentially<00:02:24.690> what<00:02:24.990> your

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
a bus driver and essentially what your

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
a bus driver and essentially what your
goal<00:02:25.319> is<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.740> drive<00:02:26.190> around<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.670> bus<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
goal is is to drive around in a bus and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.640 
goal is is to drive around in a bus and
pick<00:02:27.209> up<00:02:27.330> by<00:02:27.420> passengers<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.140> drop<00:02:28.290> them<00:02:28.470> off

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
pick up by passengers and drop them off

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.550 
pick up by passengers and drop them off
which<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.130> know<00:02:29.190> sounds<00:02:29.490> very<00:02:29.790> boring<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:31.140> then

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
which I know sounds very boring but then

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.230 
which I know sounds very boring but then
again<00:02:31.740> sort<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.190> swinging<00:02:32.430> birds<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:32.880> other

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
again sort of swinging birds at other

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.780 
again sort of swinging birds at other
birds<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.750> pigs<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.140> boxes<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.610> make

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
birds and pigs and boxes so you can make

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.050 
birds and pigs and boxes so you can make
the<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:36.060> argument<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.450> Angry<00:02:36.780> Birds<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:38.060> as

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the same argument for Angry Birds but as

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.550 
the same argument for Angry Birds but as
you'll<00:02:39.300> see<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.600> second<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.320> fairly

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you'll see in a second this is a fairly

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.610 
you'll see in a second this is a fairly
more<00:02:40.830> intensive<00:02:41.340> 3d<00:02:41.700> game<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.440> said<00:02:43.590> I

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
more intensive 3d game it like I said I

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.050 
more intensive 3d game it like I said I
have<00:02:43.739> all<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> graphics<00:02:44.310> set<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.580> high<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
have all the graphics set to high and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.020 
have all the graphics set to high and
with<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> fairly<00:02:46.160> underpowered<00:02:47.160> graphics<00:02:47.760> card

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
with a fairly underpowered graphics card

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.150 
with a fairly underpowered graphics card
for<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.270> computer<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.500> actually<00:02:49.830> handles

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
for a computer on the actually handles

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.610 
for a computer on the actually handles
it<00:02:50.250> very<00:02:50.280> well<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> 4000<00:02:51.360> graphics<00:02:51.959> built<00:02:52.440> in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it very well the 4000 graphics built in

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.800 
it very well the 4000 graphics built in
err<00:02:52.739> pretty<00:02:53.610> decent<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:56.340> does<00:02:56.640> 3d<00:02:57.239> rendering

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
err pretty decent it does 3d rendering

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.440 
err pretty decent it does 3d rendering
it's<00:02:58.080> okay<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.070> mean<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.820> don't<00:02:59.880> know<00:03:00.090> why<00:03:00.269> there

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
it's okay I mean I don't know why there

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.790 
it's okay I mean I don't know why there
was<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.630> much<00:03:00.720> frame<00:03:00.989> dropping<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> screen

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
was so much frame dropping in the screen

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.080 
was so much frame dropping in the screen
recording<00:03:02.160> because<00:03:02.400> when<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.610> was<00:03:02.670> playing<00:03:02.880> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
recording because when I was playing it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.009 
recording because when I was playing it
there<00:03:03.269> wasn't<00:03:03.570> any<00:03:03.780> actually<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:05.810> you'll<00:03:06.810> see

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
there wasn't any actually but you'll see

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.650 
there wasn't any actually but you'll see
this<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.410> second<00:03:07.800> I'm<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.310> gonna<00:03:08.660> drive

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
this in a second I'm just gonna drive

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.180 
this in a second I'm just gonna drive
around<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.170> pan<00:03:10.410> around<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.769> show<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.070> how

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
around and pan around and show you how

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.520 
around and pan around and show you how
well<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:11.820> renders<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.300> all<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:13.380> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
well it actually renders it all like I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.990 
well it actually renders it all like I
said<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.980> screen<00:03:14.250> recording<00:03:14.640> was<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> bit

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
said the screen recording was a bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
said the screen recording was a bit
janky<00:03:15.300> I'm<00:03:15.660> not<00:03:15.900> really<00:03:16.080> sure<00:03:16.380> why<00:03:16.560> actual
