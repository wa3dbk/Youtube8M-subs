on<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:01.079> model<00:00:01.469> or<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.879> little<00:00:02.879> car<00:00:03.300> there's<00:00:03.689> a

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
on the model or the little car there's a

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.340 
on the model or the little car there's a
kind<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.680> like<00:00:04.830> these<00:00:05.029> four<00:00:06.029> little<00:00:06.350> pieces

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
kind of like these four little pieces

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.540 
kind of like these four little pieces
that<00:00:07.589> are<00:00:07.680> sitting<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:07.919> top<00:00:08.130> they're<00:00:08.370> really

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
that are sitting on top they're really

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.310 
that are sitting on top they're really
plain<00:00:08.790> looking<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.330> when<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.960> blowing<00:00:10.230> up

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
plain looking and when you blowing up

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.169 
plain looking and when you blowing up
into<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> scale<00:00:11.040> like<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.639> make

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
into a scale like this we have to make

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.009 
into a scale like this we have to make
something<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.570> looks<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.750> little<00:00:12.929> more

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
something that looks a little more

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.289 
something that looks a little more
interesting<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.400> designed<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.790> part<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
interesting so we designed this part and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.779 
interesting so we designed this part and
the<00:00:15.450> computer<00:00:15.870> milled<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.980> because<00:00:17.760> I

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the computer milled it out and because I

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.070 
the computer milled it out and because I
need<00:00:18.000> eight<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.359> four<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.720> each<00:00:18.810> cover

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
need eight of these four in each cover

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.630 
need eight of these four in each cover
I'm<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.619> duplicate<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> eight

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
I'm going to have to duplicate it eight

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
I'm going to have to duplicate it eight
times<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.180> rather<00:00:21.960> mold<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:22.769> cast<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
times I rather mold it and then cast it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.529 
times I rather mold it and then cast it
so<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.240> sit<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so that we don't have to sit there and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.029 
so that we don't have to sit there and
mill<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.930> eight<00:00:25.140> parts<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> finish<00:00:25.890> eight

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
mill out eight parts and finish eight

properly<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.770> need<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.190> pull<00:00:47.430> the

properly what we need to do is pull the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
properly what we need to do is pull the
air<00:00:47.940> bubbles<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> silicon<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.440> we're

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
air bubbles out of the silicon so we're

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.830 
air bubbles out of the silicon so we're
going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> use<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.309> vacuum

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
going to we're going to use this vacuum

don't<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.399> turn<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.730> thing<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
don't know if we turn this thing on and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
don't know if we turn this thing on and
leave<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> open<00:00:58.199> maybe<00:00:58.500> we'll<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.010> die

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
leave it open maybe we'll all die

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
be a spark plug wire it comes down here

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.910 
be a spark plug wire it comes down here
and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.080> two<00:02:29.230> down<00:02:29.380> here<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.650> then<00:02:29.799> you're
