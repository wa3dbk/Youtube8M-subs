you<00:01:38.369> can't<00:01:38.610> wait<00:01:38.850> let<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.030> explain<00:01:39.150> okay<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you can't wait let me explain okay so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200 
you can't wait let me explain okay so
for<00:01:40.350> most<00:01:40.470> other<00:01:40.799> spawn<00:01:41.159> eggs<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> spawn

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
for most other spawn eggs you can spawn

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.380 
for most other spawn eggs you can spawn
baby<00:01:42.810> versions<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.189> spawn<00:01:44.460> egg<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:45.119> just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
baby versions of the spawn egg by just

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.170 
baby versions of the spawn egg by just
tapping<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.899> twice<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.159> flight<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.030> want

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
tapping it twice on the flight if I want

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
tapping it twice on the flight if I want
a<00:01:48.210> baby<00:01:48.299> pig<00:01:48.600> I'll<00:01:48.780> tap<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> pig<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
a baby pig I'll tap on the pig with a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.050 
a baby pig I'll tap on the pig with a
spawn<00:01:49.950> egg<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.430> bring<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.759> pay<00:01:50.909> B

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
spawn egg and it will bring in a pay B

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
spawn egg and it will bring in a pay B
Pig<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.649> zombie

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
Pig that's not how you do it with zombie

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
Pig that's not how you do it with zombie
Pigman<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.720> working

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
Pigman as you can see it's not working

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
Pigman as you can see it's not working
I'm<00:01:55.320> tapping<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> doesn't<00:01:56.280> work<00:01:56.549> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I'm tapping it it doesn't work you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.510 
I'm tapping it it doesn't work you
actually<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> by<00:01:58.110> random<00:01:58.890> chance<00:01:58.920> if

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
actually just get it by random chance if

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.130 
actually just get it by random chance if
you<00:01:59.610> keep<00:01:59.820> spawning<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.960> will

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you keep spawning them in you will

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
you keep spawning them in you will
eventually<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> baby<00:02:02.130> zombie<00:02:02.549> Pigman<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
eventually get a baby zombie Pigman and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.330 
eventually get a baby zombie Pigman and

until<00:02:35.120> 2:19<00:02:36.120> came<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.660> knew<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.350> a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
until 2:19 came out I knew it was a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.130 
until 2:19 came out I knew it was a
feature<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.890> PC<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.780> layer

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
feature on the PC but you can now layer

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.100 
feature on the PC but you can now layer
snow<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.370> right<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.910> layer<00:02:42.090> snow<00:02:42.600> so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
snow that's right you can layer snow so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.110 
snow that's right you can layer snow so
there<00:02:43.260> at<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.770> five<00:02:44.160> layers<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.580> think<00:02:44.850> one

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
there at like five layers I think one

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.300 
there at like five layers I think one
two<00:02:45.480> three<00:02:46.019> four<00:02:46.470> five<00:02:47.600> six<00:02:48.830> seven<00:02:49.830> eight

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
two three four five six seven eight

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.430 
two three four five six seven eight
there<00:02:51.000> are<00:02:51.090> eight<00:02:51.269> layers<00:02:51.570> until<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> make<00:02:52.410> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
there are eight layers until you make a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.979 
there are eight layers until you make a
full<00:02:52.739> block<00:02:53.010> eight<00:02:53.550> layers<00:02:54.150> think<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
full block eight layers think the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.290 
full block eight layers think the
possibilities<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.980> mean<00:02:56.100> look<00:02:56.310> how<00:02:56.489> cool<00:02:57.090> these

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
possibilities I mean look how cool these

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300 
possibilities I mean look how cool these
stairs<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.920> like

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
stairs can be just think if you like

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.370 
stairs can be just think if you like
building<00:02:59.760> modern<00:03:00.060> houses<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:01.050> could<00:03:01.260> be

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
building modern houses this could be

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.440 
building modern houses this could be
some<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.860> modern<00:03:02.280> stairs<00:03:02.640> or<00:03:02.880> maybe<00:03:03.060> you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
some really modern stairs or maybe you

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.750 
some really modern stairs or maybe you
know<00:03:03.569> use<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.050> exterior<00:03:04.590> design<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.400> don't

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
know use it in exterior design I don't

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.160 
know use it in exterior design I don't
know<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:06.090> really<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.750> great<00:03:06.900> at

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
know I'm really not that great at

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.590 
know I'm really not that great at
building<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.830> seriously<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.940> looks<00:03:08.970> amazing

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
building but seriously it looks amazing

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.630 
building but seriously it looks amazing
and<00:03:10.170> especially<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.920> some<00:03:11.130> texture<00:03:11.459> packs

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and especially in some texture packs

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.160 
and especially in some texture packs
like<00:03:11.850> maybe<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.269> city<00:03:12.480> texture<00:03:12.930> pack<00:03:13.140> is

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
like maybe the city texture pack is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
like maybe the city texture pack is
gonna<00:03:13.530> look<00:03:13.739> super<00:03:14.220> cool<00:03:14.370> yeah<00:03:14.700> there<00:03:14.880> are

there's no other block like it in

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.819 
there's no other block like it in
Minecraft<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.180> cannot<00:03:24.510> use<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:25.590> slabs

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
Minecraft you cannot use that for slabs

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.770 
Minecraft you cannot use that for slabs
you<00:03:26.070> know<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.640> slabs<00:03:26.910> are<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> lot<00:03:27.390> bigger

but this this is tiny and it's amazing
so<00:03:30.329> definitely<00:03:31.230> check<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.560> out<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:31.950> last

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
so definitely check that out and last

so definitely check that out and last
but<00:03:32.700> not<00:03:32.940> least<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.019> last<00:03:34.260> secret

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but not least this is the last secret

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.190 
but not least this is the last secret

crazy<00:03:50.609> now<00:03:51.480> this<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> very<00:03:52.739> interesting

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
crazy now this is a very interesting

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.000 
crazy now this is a very interesting
feature<00:03:53.579> because<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.510> cannot<00:03:55.230> spawn<00:03:55.680> by

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
feature because this cannot spawn by

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.490 
feature because this cannot spawn by
itself<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.700> does<00:03:56.910> not<00:03:57.090> spawn<00:03:57.420> by<00:03:57.600> itself<00:03:57.930> you

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
itself this does not spawn by itself you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.099 
itself this does not spawn by itself you
have<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.160> creative<00:03:59.370> or<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.630> survival

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
have to be in creative or in survival

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.390 
have to be in creative or in survival
with<00:04:01.290> spawn<00:04:01.560> eggs<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:01.859> have<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.250> with

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
with spawn eggs you have to do it with

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.460 
with spawn eggs you have to do it with
spawn<00:04:02.700> eggs<00:04:02.970> basically<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.200> have<00:04:04.350> to

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
spawn eggs basically and you have to

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.920 
spawn eggs basically and you have to
spawn<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:05.070> spiders<00:04:05.880> not<00:04:06.150> with<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.450> skeletons

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.229 
spawn in spiders not with the skeletons
you<00:04:07.410> spawn<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:07.709> spiders<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.609> there's<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.030> very

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
you spawn in spiders and there's a very

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.650 
you spawn in spiders and there's a very
small<00:04:09.630> chance<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.730> spider<00:04:12.060> will<00:04:12.390> spawn

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
small chance that the spider will spawn

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.599 
small chance that the spider will spawn
without<00:04:13.079> with<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> skeleton<00:04:13.890> riding<00:04:14.310> on<00:04:14.430> top

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
without with the skeleton riding on top

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.909 
without with the skeleton riding on top
of<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.940> now<00:04:15.420> how<00:04:15.690> freaky<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.799> have

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
of it now how freaky is that you have

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.430 
of it now how freaky is that you have
like<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> 6-foot<00:04:17.820> tall<00:04:18.090> skeleton<00:04:18.750> riding<00:04:19.380> a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
like a 6-foot tall skeleton riding a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.320 
like a 6-foot tall skeleton riding a
giant<00:04:19.680> spider<00:04:20.160> coming<00:04:20.669> at<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.820> with<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:21.030> sword

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
giant spider coming at you with a sword

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.810 
giant spider coming at you with a sword
is<00:04:21.840> pretty<00:04:22.229> off-putting<00:04:22.770> now<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.610> know<00:04:23.729> it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
is pretty off-putting now you know it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.250 
is pretty off-putting now you know it
didn't<00:04:24.000> actually<00:04:24.150> take<00:04:24.450> me<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:24.750> lot<00:04:24.990> that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
didn't actually take me this lot that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.870 
didn't actually take me this lot that
long<00:04:25.470> to

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
long to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.270 
long to
spawn<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.780> not<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.050> hard<00:04:27.260> really<00:04:27.530> but

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
spawn in it's not that hard really but

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.130 
spawn in it's not that hard really but
just<00:04:28.310> think<00:04:28.820> about<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:29.900> wasn't

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
just think about it if this wasn't

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.960 
just think about it if this wasn't
survivable<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:30.920> would<00:04:31.070> be<00:04:31.190> quite<00:04:31.520> scary

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
survivable this would be quite scary

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.970 
survivable this would be quite scary
luckily<00:04:32.660> it's<00:04:32.810> not<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.200> have<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.560> spawn<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.920> in

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
luckily it's not you have to spawn it in

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.340 
luckily it's not you have to spawn it in
artificially<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:35.090> does<00:04:35.360> not<00:04:35.600> spawn<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.200> its

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
artificially it does not spawn on its

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.920 
artificially it does not spawn on its
own<00:04:36.560> it's<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.950> only<00:04:37.190> mob<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.880> Minecraft<00:04:38.450> that

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
own it's the only mob in Minecraft that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.200 
own it's the only mob in Minecraft that
only<00:04:39.230> spawns<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.980> creative<00:04:40.490> yeah<00:04:40.910> this<00:04:41.090> is

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
only spawns in creative yeah this is

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.330 
only spawns in creative yeah this is
definitely<00:04:41.330> fun<00:04:41.780> if<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.530> like<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> if<00:04:43.220> you

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
definitely fun if you have like a if you

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.190 
definitely fun if you have like a if you
make<00:04:43.580> adventure<00:04:44.270> maps<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:44.750> stuff<00:04:44.810> like<00:04:45.020> that

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
make adventure maps and stuff like that

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.020 
make adventure maps and stuff like that
if<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.500> give<00:04:45.740> them<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.950> name<00:04:46.160> tag<00:04:46.490> they<00:04:46.850> won't

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
if you give them a name tag they won't

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.760 
if you give them a name tag they won't
do<00:04:47.180> spawn<00:04:47.510> you<00:04:48.020> can<00:04:48.140> make<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.350> like<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.500> boss

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
do spawn you can make it like a boss

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.770 
do spawn you can make it like a boss
battle<00:04:49.010> put<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.820> in<00:04:49.940> some<00:04:50.150> kind<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.480> level

battle put it in some kind of level

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.960 
battle put it in some kind of level
design<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.830> think<00:04:52.070> how<00:04:52.190> dangerous<00:04:52.610> this

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
design and just think how dangerous this

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.270 
design and just think how dangerous this
thing<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.570> first<00:04:54.230> of<00:04:54.350> all<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.590> runs<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.070> jumps

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
thing is first of all it runs and jumps

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.130 
thing is first of all it runs and jumps
very<00:04:55.400> fast<00:04:55.850> because<00:04:56.060> it's<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.330> spider<00:04:56.630> has<00:04:56.960> the

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
very fast because it's a spider has the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.830 
very fast because it's a spider has the
speed<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.620> spider<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.760> attack<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.660> a

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
speed of a spider and the attack of a

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.930 
speed of a spider and the attack of a
wither<00:05:00.080> skeleton<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:00.890> they<00:05:01.130> spider<00:05:01.460> combine

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
wither skeleton and they spider combine

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.420 
wither skeleton and they spider combine
so<00:05:02.270> you'll<00:05:02.450> get<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.780> wither<00:05:03.020> part<00:05:03.740> where<00:05:04.250> you
