the chisel and I'll show you what I mean
you<00:02:08.490> can<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.820> this<00:02:08.970> 3<00:02:09.179> inch<00:02:09.330> wide<00:02:09.479> chisel<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you can see this 3 inch wide chisel you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
you can see this 3 inch wide chisel you
put<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.100> on<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.370> rough<00:02:11.550> surface<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.150> making

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
put it on this rough surface it's making

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.150 
put it on this rough surface it's making
contact<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.350> very<00:02:13.650> small<00:02:13.980> area

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.650 

what<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.310> means<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:18.850> all<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.390> force

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
what this means is that all the force

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.840 
what this means is that all the force
and<00:02:19.900> pressure<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.440> being<00:02:21.190> put<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.610> one

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
and pressure is being put on this one

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.880 
and pressure is being put on this one
little<00:02:22.060> area<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.450> carbide<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.680> more

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
little area of carbide and it's more

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.340 
little area of carbide and it's more
unlikely<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> break<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.840> other<00:02:25.930> thing<00:02:26.200> is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
unlikely to break the other thing is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.660 
unlikely to break the other thing is
that<00:02:26.380> on<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> wide<00:02:26.920> chisel<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.490> rough

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that on a wide chisel and a rough

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.670 
that on a wide chisel and a rough
surface<00:02:27.910> we're<00:02:28.780> quite<00:02:28.930> likely<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.380> catch<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
surface we're quite likely to catch a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.010 
surface we're quite likely to catch a
corner<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.220> leave<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> mark<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> stone<00:02:31.420> you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
corner and leave a mark in the stone you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.760 
corner and leave a mark in the stone you
don't<00:02:32.200> want<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.510> smoother<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.020> stone<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
don't want the smoother the stone the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.680 
don't want the smoother the stone the
wider<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.220> chisel<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.330> can<00:02:40.450> see

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
wider the chisel and here you can see

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.660 
wider the chisel and here you can see
that<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.170> chisel<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.710> complete<00:02:42.220> contact

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
that this chisel is complete contact

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.510 
that this chisel is complete contact

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.670 
with the stone surface I've shown you
just<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.910> small<00:02:49.030> sample<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> wide<00:02:50.110> variety

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
just a small sample of the wide variety

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.580 
just a small sample of the wide variety
of<00:02:50.710> chisel<00:02:51.160> sizes<00:02:51.670> styles<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.020> make<00:02:53.290> and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
of chisel sizes styles that we make and

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.480
