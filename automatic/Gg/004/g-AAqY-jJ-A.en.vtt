00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
okay now you owner guys pumping number

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.929 
okay now you owner guys pumping number
one<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.380> second<00:00:23.830> option<00:00:24.070> they<00:00:24.430> have<00:00:24.640> is

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
one the second option they have is

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.150 
one the second option they have is
manually<00:00:25.599> and<00:00:25.869> what<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:25.989> mean<00:00:26.259> by<00:00:26.410> manually

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
manually and what I mean by manually

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.490 
manually and what I mean by manually
it's<00:00:27.550> basically<00:00:27.970> wheelie<00:00:28.360> in<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.750> jumps<00:00:29.169> okay

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
it's basically wheelie in the jumps okay

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.049 
it's basically wheelie in the jumps okay
now<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.130> trick<00:00:30.489> is

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
now the trick is

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.119 
now the trick is
the<00:00:32.329> setup<00:00:32.629> is<00:00:32.930> gonna<00:00:33.050> be<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.379> same<00:00:33.620> okay<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
the setup is gonna be the same okay I

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.590 
the setup is gonna be the same okay I
didn't<00:00:34.460> cover<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:34.820> before<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.329> want<00:00:35.539> to

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
didn't cover this before you want to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.319 
didn't cover this before you want to
pedal<00:00:35.989> all<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.710> way<00:00:36.920> up<00:00:37.039> to<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.399> jump<00:00:37.670> okay<00:00:38.120> we

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
pedal all the way up to the jump okay we

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.660 
pedal all the way up to the jump okay we
don't<00:00:38.420> want<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.690> stop<00:00:38.870> way<00:00:39.440> back<00:00:39.649> here<00:00:40.010> because

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
don't want to stop way back here because

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.310 
don't want to stop way back here because
someone<00:00:41.030> else<00:00:41.269> is<00:00:41.390> gonna<00:00:41.510> power<00:00:41.839> right<00:00:42.050> past

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
someone else is gonna power right past

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.850 
someone else is gonna power right past
it

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.470 
it
so<00:00:43.280> we<00:00:43.460> want<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.670> pedal<00:00:43.969> all<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.089> way<00:00:44.180> up<00:00:44.300> to

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
so we want to pedal all the way up to

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.389 
so we want to pedal all the way up to
jump<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.649> want<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:45.920> stop<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:46.430> time

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:10.840 

if<00:00:52.670> your<00:00:52.879> stiff

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.560 

the<00:01:11.850> job

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.820 

not<00:01:14.990> ever<00:01:15.140> happened<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.650> anyone<00:01:16.090> anyone<00:01:20.830> when

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
not ever happened to anyone anyone when

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.410 
not ever happened to anyone anyone when
that<00:01:21.980> happens<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.730> you<00:01:22.880> learned<00:01:23.150> real

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
that happens to you you learned real

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.910 
that happens to you you learned real
quick<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.900> your<00:01:24.020> pedal<00:01:24.320> doesn't<00:01:24.500> need<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.800> be

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
quick that your pedal doesn't need to be

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.890 
quick that your pedal doesn't need to be
in<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.190> position<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.510> want<00:01:26.660> to<00:01:26.750> make

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
in that position so you want to make

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.110 
in that position so you want to make
sure<00:01:26.930> our<00:01:27.080> pedals<00:01:27.500> are<00:01:27.650> nice<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.130> level<00:01:28.280> as<00:01:28.820> we

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
sure our pedals are nice and level as we

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.800 
sure our pedals are nice and level as we
go<00:01:29.270> over<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.570> top<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.020> jump<00:01:30.290> okay<00:01:30.830> so<00:01:31.810> as

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
go over the top of the jump okay so as

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.810 
go over the top of the jump okay so as
you<00:01:32.870> get<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.320> little<00:01:33.620> older<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:34.220> get<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.550> little

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
you get a little older you get a little

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.670 
you get a little older you get a little
faster<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:35.540> going<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.870> be<00:01:35.960> really<00:01:36.350> hard<00:01:36.590> to

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
faster it's going to be really hard to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.560 
faster it's going to be really hard to
keep<00:01:36.770> both<00:01:37.160> wheels<00:01:37.460> on<00:01:37.729> your<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.300> ground

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
keep both wheels on your on the ground

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.930 
keep both wheels on your on the ground
so<00:01:39.170> what<00:01:39.350> starts<00:01:39.680> happening<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:40.729> go<00:01:40.880> too

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
so what starts happening is you go too

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.420 
so what starts happening is you go too
fast<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.930> kind<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.260> jump<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.650> little<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:43.040> and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
fast you kind of jump a little bit and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.060 
fast you kind of jump a little bit and
that's<00:01:43.670> not<00:01:43.910> smooth<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:45.170> that's<00:01:45.800> when<00:01:45.979> you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
that's not smooth so that's when you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.230 
that's not smooth so that's when you
move<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.550> option<00:01:46.970> number<00:01:47.090> two

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
move to option number two

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.880 
move to option number two
so<00:01:49.780> you're<00:01:49.960> going<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.110> pedal<00:01:50.439> all<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.649> way<00:01:50.710> up

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
so you're going to pedal all the way up

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.100 
so you're going to pedal all the way up
to<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.130> jump<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.579> same<00:01:51.820> way<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:52.990> did

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
to the jump the same way that we did

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.550 
to the jump the same way that we did
before

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
before

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.459 
before
get<00:01:54.340> your<00:01:54.460> pedals<00:01:54.850> nice<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.360> level<00:01:55.539> but<00:01:56.350> as

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
get your pedals nice and level but as

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.529 
get your pedals nice and level but as
your<00:01:56.619> front<00:01:56.829> wheel<00:01:57.070> comes<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.700> top<00:01:57.939> you're

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
your front wheel comes up the top you're

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.990 
your front wheel comes up the top you're
going<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.750> lean<00:01:59.020> back<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.320> little<00:01:59.649> bit<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.159> you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
going to lean back a little bit and you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.179 
going to lean back a little bit and you
want<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.270> push<00:02:01.539> push<00:02:02.289> on<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.619> pedals<00:02:03.039> and

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
want to push push on the pedals and

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.429 
want to push push on the pedals and
that's<00:02:03.610> going<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.909> push<00:02:04.090> your<00:02:04.210> bike<00:02:04.420> up<00:02:04.659> into<00:02:05.409> a

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
that's going to push your bike up into a

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.350 
that's going to push your bike up into a
wheelie<00:02:05.770> now<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.579> gotta<00:02:06.789> be<00:02:06.850> really<00:02:07.329> careful

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
wheelie now you gotta be really careful

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.270 
wheelie now you gotta be really careful
this<00:02:07.899> is<00:02:07.960> tricky<00:02:08.590> it's<00:02:08.709> way<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.950> get<00:02:09.220> over

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
this is tricky it's way to get over

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.059 
this is tricky it's way to get over
instinct<00:02:09.910> it's<00:02:10.479> harder<00:02:10.810> than<00:02:10.840> jumping<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
instinct it's harder than jumping and a

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.800 
instinct it's harder than jumping and a
lot<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.310> times<00:02:12.489> it's<00:02:12.700> faster<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.660> is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
lot of times it's faster but it is

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.050 
lot of times it's faster but it is
tricky<00:02:14.110> but<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:14.860> pushing<00:02:15.370> too<00:02:15.549> hard

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
tricky but then pushing too hard

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.490 
tricky but then pushing too hard
what<00:02:16.569> happens<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.250> you've<00:02:21.849> got<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:23.290> best

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
what happens so you've got a the best

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.320 
what happens so you've got a the best
trick<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.069> know<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.819> keep<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.120> finger

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
trick that I know of is to keep a finger

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.000 
trick that I know of is to keep a finger
on<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.750> brake<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.560> think<00:02:26.860> you're

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
on the brake and if you think you're

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.130 
on the brake and if you think you're
gonna<00:02:27.130> go<00:02:27.340> too<00:02:27.579> far<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:28.239> hit<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.780> brakes<00:02:29.019> a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
gonna go too far just hit the brakes a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.550 
gonna go too far just hit the brakes a
little<00:02:29.260> bit

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
little bit

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.979 
little bit
it<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.250> bring<00:02:30.400> your<00:02:30.579> front<00:02:30.790> end<00:02:30.880> down<00:02:31.090> know

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
it will bring your front end down know

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.140 
it will bring your front end down know
the<00:02:32.140> trick<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.410> manually<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.670> want<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.940> push

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the trick to manually you want to push

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.930 
the trick to manually you want to push
the<00:02:34.329> bike<00:02:34.510> away<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.230> lean<00:02:35.680> back<00:02:35.790> enough<00:02:36.790> to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the bike away and lean back enough to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.120 
the bike away and lean back enough to
keep<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.269> run<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.630> DUP<00:02:37.870> but<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.739> want<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
keep it run in DUP but you want it to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.150 
keep it run in DUP but you want it to
stay<00:02:39.370> up<00:02:39.549> just<00:02:40.030> long<00:02:40.420> enough<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:41.019> get<00:02:41.769> here

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
stay up just long enough to get here

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.250 
stay up just long enough to get here
okay<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:43.180> don't<00:02:43.360> want<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.660> come<00:02:43.810> down<00:02:44.049> right

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
okay we don't want it to come down right

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.199 
okay we don't want it to come down right
here<00:02:44.650> because<00:02:45.310> that's<00:02:45.430> gonna<00:02:45.670> slow<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.000> down

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
here because that's gonna slow you down

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.729 
here because that's gonna slow you down
right<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:46.900> gonna<00:02:46.959> be<00:02:47.170> rough

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
right and it's gonna be rough

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.830 
right and it's gonna be rough
and<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.069> could<00:02:48.220> make<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.519> fall<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:49.510> we<00:02:49.660> don't

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and it could make you fall but we don't

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.199 
and it could make you fall but we don't
want<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.049> keep<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.290> up<00:02:50.440> too<00:02:50.620> far<00:02:50.890> because<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:52.060> we

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
want to keep it up too far because if we

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.479 
want to keep it up too far because if we
go<00:02:52.359> over<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:52.780> here<00:02:53.019> wheezing<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
go over with here wheezing like this the

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.899 
go over with here wheezing like this the
chance<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.910> loop<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.239> out<00:02:55.389> there

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
chance to loop it out there

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.309 
chance to loop it out there
that's<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.120> trickiest<00:02:59.540> way<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.840> can<00:03:00.109> take<00:03:00.260> a

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
that's the trickiest way you can take a

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.099 
that's the trickiest way you can take a
jump<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.400> takes<00:03:01.609> a<00:03:01.730> lot<00:03:01.909> of<00:03:01.939> practice<00:03:02.569> and

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
jump and it takes a lot of practice and

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.780 
jump and it takes a lot of practice and
the<00:03:03.170> best<00:03:03.469> way<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.709> found<00:03:03.829> of<00:03:04.219> practice<00:03:04.579> is<00:03:04.760> just

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
the best way I found of practice is just

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.179 
the best way I found of practice is just
to<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.989> on<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.170> street<00:03:06.469> out<00:03:06.680> here<00:03:06.920> just

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
to do it on the street out here just

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.849 
to do it on the street out here just
lean<00:03:07.849> back<00:03:07.879> pick<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.569> front<00:03:08.749> end<00:03:08.959> up<00:03:09.109> try<00:03:09.829> to

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
lean back pick the front end up try to

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.860 
lean back pick the front end up try to
wheelie<00:03:10.249> for<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.489> while<00:03:10.639> without<00:03:10.819> pedaling<00:03:11.359> and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
wheelie for a while without pedaling and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.149 
wheelie for a while without pedaling and
that's<00:03:12.049> when<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.349> got<00:03:12.469> to<00:03:12.499> find<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.859> balance

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
that's when you got to find that balance

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.399 
that's when you got to find that balance
point<00:03:13.489> okay<00:03:14.120> where<00:03:14.810> you're<00:03:14.930> not<00:03:15.079> following

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
point okay where you're not following

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.899 
point okay where you're not following
frontward<00:03:15.859> but<00:03:16.340> you're<00:03:16.459> not<00:03:16.549> going<00:03:16.819> over

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
frontward but you're not going over

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.179 
frontward but you're not going over
backwards<00:03:17.450> either<00:03:17.659> it's<00:03:18.379> really<00:03:18.680> hard<00:03:18.920> it's

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
backwards either it's really hard it's

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.920 
backwards either it's really hard it's
gonna<00:03:19.250> take<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.579> lot<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.819> practice<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.810> you

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
gonna take a lot of practice but you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.449 
gonna take a lot of practice but you
guys<00:03:21.049> can<00:03:21.349> do<00:03:21.469> it<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.799> Jeff<00:03:22.069> will<00:03:22.250> show<00:03:22.400> you

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
guys can do it so Jeff will show you

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.819 
guys can do it so Jeff will show you
exactly<00:03:22.819> what<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.120> mean<00:03:23.329> when<00:03:24.049> we<00:03:24.169> say<00:03:24.349> manual

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
exactly what I mean when we say manual

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.300 
exactly what I mean when we say manual
in<00:03:24.919> the<00:03:25.010> jump

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.430 

all<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> way<00:03:27.910> up<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.420> they<00:03:29.110> were<00:03:29.230> going<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
all the way up to it they were going to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.220 
all the way up to it they were going to
relax<00:03:29.800> in<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.550> petals<00:03:30.940> level

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.300 

push<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> bike<00:03:36.590> away

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.620 

like<00:03:43.310> that

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.630 

that's<00:03:48.110> that's<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.680> trickiest<00:03:49.100> way<00:03:49.340> he<00:03:49.490> can

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
that's that's the trickiest way he can

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.970 
that's that's the trickiest way he can
do<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.970> but<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:50.600> really<00:03:50.930> fast<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.830> that's

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
do it but it's really fast and that's

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.290 
do it but it's really fast and that's
what<00:03:52.250> you're<00:03:52.370> going<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.550> have<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.820> start<00:03:53.060> doing

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
what you're going to have to start doing

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.360 
what you're going to have to start doing
when<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.260> get<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> little<00:03:54.650> bigger<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:55.220> little

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
when you get a little bigger a little

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.790 
when you get a little bigger a little
faster<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.630> can't<00:03:56.870> keep<00:03:57.080> both<00:03:57.320> wheels<00:03:57.620> on

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
faster and you can't keep both wheels on

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.700 
faster and you can't keep both wheels on
the<00:03:57.920> ground<00:03:58.100> what<00:03:59.000> we're<00:03:59.150> here<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.450> do<00:03:59.710> the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
the ground what we're here to do the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.740 
the ground what we're here to do the
trickiest<00:04:01.190> way<00:04:01.460> is<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:01.850> always<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.390> best<00:04:02.570> way

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
trickiest way is not always the best way

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.210 
trickiest way is not always the best way
okay<00:04:03.200> we're<00:04:03.470> here<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.680> get<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.040> finish

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
okay we're here to get to the finish

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.670 
okay we're here to get to the finish
line<00:04:04.370> first<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:05.780> when<00:04:05.930> we<00:04:06.050> talk<00:04:06.260> about<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
line first and so when we talk about the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.140 
line first and so when we talk about the
different<00:04:07.010> ways<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.340> getting<00:04:07.400> over<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.820> jump

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
different ways of getting over a jump

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.210 
different ways of getting over a jump
whether<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.630> be<00:04:08.780> pumping<00:04:09.530> with<00:04:09.710> both<00:04:09.890> wheels

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
whether it be pumping with both wheels

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.030 
whether it be pumping with both wheels
or<00:04:10.670> manually<00:04:11.360> or<00:04:11.510> even<00:04:11.840> jumping<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.710> have<00:04:12.890> to

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
or manually or even jumping you have to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.620 
or manually or even jumping you have to
figure<00:04:13.340> out<00:04:13.400> which<00:04:13.670> way<00:04:13.850> is<00:04:13.880> gonna<00:04:14.120> work<00:04:14.330> best

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
figure out which way is gonna work best

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.630 
figure out which way is gonna work best
for<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.020> some<00:04:15.830> people<00:04:15.860> are<00:04:16.220> better<00:04:16.400> at

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
for you some people are better at

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.400 
for you some people are better at
jumping<00:04:17.000> than<00:04:17.150> others<00:04:17.450> some<00:04:17.930> are<00:04:17.959> better<00:04:18.260> at
