00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.819
 experts gathered at the end of 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.620
 October for a seminar on 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.400
 the average temperature of the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.929
 planet has increased by about 0.8 degrees and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.810
 the effects have begun to be felt 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.810
 throughout the year 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:31.260
 The heat and the situation must get much worse 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 In the next years 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 ipcc designed some possible 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.969
 scenarios or better the temperature of the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.149
 planet should rise 2 degrees to the end of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.860
 century and at the worst time can reach 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 almost four degrees 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.710
 the goal now is to join forces to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.039
 try to limit the increase in temperature 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.399
 a maximum of 2 degrees it was decided that two 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.190
 degrees is what is possible for people 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:04.369
 yet to reach the level of impact that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:13.590
 we will get with the resources 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:15.150
 is to face the bc defined that the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 a panel of scientists 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.890
 it indicates that global emissions of 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.080
 greenhouse gases between 2012 and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.100
 end of the century should not 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.430
 exceed one billion tonnes of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.720
 carbon which is brave until then until the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630
 end of this century 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 this gives an average of 11 billion 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.909
 tons per year worldwide 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.899
 only the world today is 2050 so 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.820
 means that you will have to make a 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.729
 emission reduction effort. 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.560
 in the next few years a new 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.729
 climate agreement must be signed in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.710
 paris in December 2015 in the canopy and 21 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.259
 The objective is that we can reduce 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 maximum emissions of greenhouse gases 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.229
 greenhouse we have to reduce 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.369
 emissions by 80% if not more 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.319
 then it is the challenge how it is that puts everything 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 world endorsement in any of the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.420
 pcc scenarios from the most optimistic to the most 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.150
 need 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.910
 is it going to take an effort to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.650
 adapting to the impacts of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.280
 climate change because whatever 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.400
 be the degree of the change if it is 2 degrees if 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.349
 for 3 or 4 the impact will be and indeed 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.010
 he already is already feeling this 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.380
 impact 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.150
 this requires policy planning 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.910
 which is local because it is the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 is it always local despite the problem 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.540
 be a global problem
