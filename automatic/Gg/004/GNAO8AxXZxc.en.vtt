00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.150
 see more 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.640
 velvety technician water treatment but the idea of ​​checking that the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.580
 quality of water produced in treatment plants 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.940
 it's a very very varied profession because it gives birth to 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.580
 samples taken from the laboratory and then to my contact with 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.540
 the operator to verify that any treatment is correct it is a job 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.019
 but who needs brown is a little bit of technicality not 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.830
 knowledge by signing it a water treatment 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.340
 the montreal team 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.209
 we reproduce 

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:03.510
 it's him 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 the fate of this meeting 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 around 1am 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 contrary to what we can think it's really a field work 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.430
 we do not stay locked up whatever the weather 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.480
 the samples are paid 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.490
 it can be done on the stage on the marne outside so you have to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.410
 really love the terrain that made for a really love the things that 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.000
 move really liked the unexpected it is him the guarantor of the quality of the water 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.140
 so he has a vital role in controlling the quality of the water 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 although consumers will have it 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.890
 in his leaflet where his all to the needs of each other in fact 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.710
 to work 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.310
 so you have to have the spirit of equipped it's still something enough 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 interesting very motivating evolution level anyway in me I 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.379
 see I came back as a laboratory assistant 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.370
 they stayed three to four years then I was given the opportunity to 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.260
 go into production that even that allowed to evolve and passes and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.139
 technicians 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.650
 then by changing to quote the turn in fact anyway I was able to continue 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.900
 to evolve back laboratory and foot of a huge as responsible for the 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.899
 death of my father is still important level of evolution 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.879
 I could mark the black man in contact with him 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.909
 superman 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.199
 its writers 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.839
 I've been doing this job for ten years and I've always said 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.509
 the little flame that makes that anyway I want to continue in 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:43.429
 this way 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:47.679
 continue to have continued to resume continue this is really the 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.119
 possibility of power at the level of water treatment technician
