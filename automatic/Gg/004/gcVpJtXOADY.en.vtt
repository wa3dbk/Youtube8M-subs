00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
extra life despite the fact that this

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.010 
extra life despite the fact that this
room<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:34.910> flooded<00:00:35.210> with<00:00:35.570> light<00:00:35.780> right<00:00:35.989> now

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
room is flooded with light right now

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.389 
room is flooded with light right now
because<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.559> problem<00:00:36.890> is<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.129> room<00:00:37.280> is

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
because the problem is the room is

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.310 
because the problem is the room is
flooded<00:00:37.550> with<00:00:37.789> too<00:00:38.090> much<00:00:38.239> lightning<00:00:38.540> getting

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
flooded with too much lightning getting

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.870 
flooded with too much lightning getting
a<00:00:39.380> lot<00:00:39.560> of<00:00:39.590> plays<00:00:39.860> on<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.070> side<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.280> my<00:00:40.430> face<00:00:40.579> so

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
a lot of plays on the side of my face so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.300 
a lot of plays on the side of my face so
we<00:00:41.000> have<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.239> actually<00:00:41.360> add<00:00:42.110> more<00:00:42.530> light<00:00:42.770> even

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
we have to actually add more light even

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.010 
we have to actually add more light even
though<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.910> problem<00:00:44.300> is<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.540> we<00:00:44.660> have<00:00:44.810> too

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
though the problem is that we have too

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.650 
though the problem is that we have too
much<00:00:45.170> light<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.340> it<00:00:46.640> turns<00:00:46.820> out<00:00:47.000> light<00:00:47.420> is

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
much light so it turns out light is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.600 
much light so it turns out light is
always<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.200> solution<00:00:48.350> like<00:00:49.310> look<00:00:49.460> at<00:00:49.550> the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
always the solution like look at the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.360 
always the solution like look at the
difference<00:00:49.940> even<00:00:50.090> on<00:00:50.410> even<00:00:51.410> on<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:51.710> one<00:00:51.890> I'm

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
difference even on even on that one I'm

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.290 
difference even on even on that one I'm
gonna<00:00:52.460> take<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.700> look<00:00:52.790> at<00:00:52.910> all

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
gonna take a look at all

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.330 
gonna take a look at all

think we can hear faintly in the

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.030 
think we can hear faintly in the
distance<00:04:11.930> yelling<00:04:12.930> about<00:04:13.169> how<00:04:13.319> drunk<00:04:13.530> he<00:04:13.620> is

I<00:04:14.069> made<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.090> hood<00:04:15.209> thing<00:04:15.709> um<00:04:16.709> grandma<00:04:17.639> so<00:04:17.910> hard

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
I made the hood thing um grandma so hard

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.310 
I made the hood thing um grandma so hard
it<00:04:18.209> would<00:04:18.269> be<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.510> make<00:04:18.599> an<00:04:18.780> assassin's<00:04:19.229> Creed

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
it would be to make an assassin's Creed

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.460 
it would be to make an assassin's Creed
hood<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.979> thought<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.549> too<00:04:21.060> hard<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:22.109> I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
hood and I thought not too hard and I

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.409 
hood and I thought not too hard and I
mocked<00:04:23.010> up<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.280> pattern<00:04:23.639> and<00:04:23.880> did<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> mock<00:04:24.240> up

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
mocked up a pattern and did a mock up

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.629 
mocked up a pattern and did a mock up
that<00:04:24.450> was<00:04:24.720> not<00:04:25.590> broad<00:04:26.160> enough<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
that was not broad enough in the

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.070 
that was not broad enough in the
shoulders<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.180> work<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.539> so<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> did

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
shoulders to work and so then I did

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.320 
shoulders to work and so then I did
another<00:04:28.110> one<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:29.099> of<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.340> very<00:04:29.610> fine<00:04:30.060> quality

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
another one out of a very fine quality

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.390 
another one out of a very fine quality
sheet<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.169> got<00:04:31.320> for<00:04:31.500> ten<00:04:31.740> bucks<00:04:31.950> at<00:04:32.130> Value

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
sheet that I got for ten bucks at Value

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.190 
sheet that I got for ten bucks at Value
Village<00:04:35.150> yeah<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.360> we've<00:04:36.450> got<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.720> hood<00:04:36.960> and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
Village yeah so we've got the hood and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.110 
Village yeah so we've got the hood and
then<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.530> shoulder<00:04:37.919> things<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.520> go<00:04:38.639> on<00:04:38.669> top

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
then the shoulder things that go on top

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.940 
then the shoulder things that go on top
and<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.479> pin<00:04:39.780> because<00:04:40.139> it's<00:04:40.470> not<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.710> full

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
and just pin because it's not a full

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.409 
and just pin because it's not a full
body<00:04:41.130> shot<00:04:41.250> so<00:04:41.639> I'm<00:04:41.729> like<00:04:41.880> I'm<00:04:42.000> not<00:04:42.030> making<00:04:42.210> a

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
body shot so I'm like I'm not making a

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.510 
body shot so I'm like I'm not making a
whole<00:04:42.570> garden<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.260> that's<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.620> way<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> give

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
whole garden so that's the way to give

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.920 
whole garden so that's the way to give
an<00:04:44.610> appearance<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.450> being<00:04:45.630> what<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.900> is

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
an appearance of being what it is

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.330 
an appearance of being what it is
without<00:04:46.320> being<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.740> whole<00:04:46.860> thing<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.220> then<00:04:47.310> I

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
without being the whole thing and then I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.250 
without being the whole thing and then I
added<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.610> little<00:04:47.789> loop<00:04:48.479> on<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.900> shoulder

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
added the little loop on the shoulder

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.810 
added the little loop on the shoulder
because<00:04:49.710> he<00:04:49.830> has<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.639> it's<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
because he has that and it's a

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.370 
because he has that and it's a
convenient<00:04:51.270> way<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.389> keep<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.780> strap<00:04:52.169> from

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
convenient way to keep the strap from

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.830 
convenient way to keep the strap from
flying<00:04:52.889> all<00:04:53.099> over<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.370> place<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.970> that's

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
flying all over the place and that's

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.779 
flying all over the place and that's
pretty<00:04:55.020> much<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.039> very<00:04:56.250> exciting

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
pretty much it the the very exciting

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.850 
pretty much it the the very exciting
part<00:04:56.970> for<00:04:57.030> me<00:04:57.419> because<00:04:57.960> I'm<00:04:58.169> all<00:04:58.380> about<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
part for me because I'm all about the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.200 
part for me because I'm all about the
detail<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.669> put<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.090> Eagles<00:05:00.599> on<00:05:01.020> the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
detail is that I put the Eagles on the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.969 
detail is that I put the Eagles on the
little<00:05:03.210> diamond<00:05:03.630> shape<00:05:03.660> on<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.560> hood<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:04.889> the

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
little diamond shape on the hood on the

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.350 
little diamond shape on the hood on the
front<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.340> hood<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.639> I<00:05:05.699> actually<00:05:06.060> stitched

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
front of the hood so I actually stitched

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.879 
front of the hood so I actually stitched
the<00:05:06.539> little<00:05:06.750> Eagles<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.139> are<00:05:07.320> on<00:05:07.440> there<00:05:07.710> in

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
the little Eagles that are on there in

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.560 
the little Eagles that are on there in
white<00:05:08.130> thread<00:05:08.849> which<00:05:09.000> probably<00:05:09.270> won't

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
white thread which probably won't

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.170 
white thread which probably won't
actually<00:05:09.840> show<00:05:10.229> up<00:05:10.410> in<00:05:10.650> shot<00:05:11.099> but<00:05:11.639> it's<00:05:11.789> there

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
actually show up in shot but it's there

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.610 
actually show up in shot but it's there
