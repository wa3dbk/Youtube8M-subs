00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
transmission malfunction locked up and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.650 
transmission malfunction locked up and
when<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.650> hit<00:01:03.860> us<00:01:03.980> made<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> sudden<00:01:04.699> stop

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
when you hit us made a sudden stop

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
then the airbags went off so it wasn't

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.410 
then the airbags went off so it wasn't
that<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.990> airbag<00:01:09.320> just<00:01:09.350> went<00:01:09.860> off

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
that the airbag just went off

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.520
