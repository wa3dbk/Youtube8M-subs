00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.449 

I<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.810> what<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.349> was<00:02:31.530> trying<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.890> achieve<00:02:31.980> was

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
I think what I was trying to achieve was

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.630 
I think what I was trying to achieve was
a<00:02:32.489> combination<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.690> extreme<00:02:34.470> realism<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
a combination of extreme realism so that

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.520 
a combination of extreme realism so that
the<00:02:35.790> film<00:02:36.090> had<00:02:36.239> feel<00:02:36.480> rooted<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.110> visceral

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the film had feel rooted in a visceral

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.600 
the film had feel rooted in a visceral
reality<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.610> also<00:02:39.020> allowing<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.319> certain

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
reality but also allowing a certain

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.530 
reality but also allowing a certain
heightening<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.730> reality

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
heightening of reality

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.720 
heightening of reality
I<00:02:42.569> thought<00:02:43.200> Eve<00:02:43.800> outdid<00:02:44.220> herself<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.700> a

sense<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:45.300> it's<00:02:45.569> going<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> be<00:02:46.050> an

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
sense I think it's going to be an

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.559 
sense I think it's going to be an
incredibly<00:02:46.880> astonishing<00:02:47.880> film<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.180> look<00:02:48.360> at
