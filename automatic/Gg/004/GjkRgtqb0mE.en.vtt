00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
right now you can see it from the other

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.400 
right now you can see it from the other
direction<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.240> have<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.360> green<00:04:10.600> screen<00:04:10.900> out<00:04:11.200> but

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
direction I have a green screen out but

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.600 
direction I have a green screen out but
I<00:04:11.470> can<00:04:11.620> move<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.890> green<00:04:12.040> screen<00:04:12.160> up<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.459> down

I can move the green screen up and down

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.580 
I can move the green screen up and down
but<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.910> certainly<00:04:13.090> does<00:04:13.390> help<00:04:13.720> me<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.080> I

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
but it certainly does help me and I

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.740 
but it certainly does help me and I
actually<00:04:14.740> put<00:04:15.100> my<00:04:15.250> camera<00:04:15.580> almost<00:04:16.510> where<00:04:16.630> it

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
actually put my camera almost where it

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.449 
actually put my camera almost where it
is<00:04:16.840> right<00:04:16.989> now<00:04:17.049> maybe<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.440> bit<00:04:17.590> lower<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.160> you

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
is right now maybe a bit lower so you

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.789 
is right now maybe a bit lower so you
can<00:04:18.609> see<00:04:18.790> just<00:04:18.820> my<00:04:19.540> body<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.170> just<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> green

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
can see just my body and just the green

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.730 
can see just my body and just the green
screen<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:22.030> works<00:04:22.330> really<00:04:23.169> well<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.650> gives

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
screen and it works really well it gives

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.110 
screen and it works really well it gives
me<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.919> lot<00:04:24.010> more<00:04:24.070> space<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.490> move<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.000> put

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
me a lot more space to move and put

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.340 
me a lot more space to move and put
lights<00:04:25.300> around<00:04:25.570> things<00:04:25.840> like<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.260> is
