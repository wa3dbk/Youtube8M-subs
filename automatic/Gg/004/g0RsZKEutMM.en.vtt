fashion<00:00:29.460> events<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.390> Berlin<00:00:30.869> several<00:00:31.410> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
fashion events here in Berlin several I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
fashion events here in Berlin several I
guess<00:00:31.759> how<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.120> compare<00:00:33.329> them<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
guess how would you compare them to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
guess how would you compare them to
those<00:00:34.530> who<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.130> happening<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> eastern<00:00:36.270> boo<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
those who are happening in eastern boo I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
those who are happening in eastern boo I
think<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> difference<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.070> mean<00:00:38.190> fashion<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
think the difference I mean fashion is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.299 
think the difference I mean fashion is
the<00:00:39.210> global<00:00:39.480> thing<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.110> universal<00:00:40.649> things<00:00:40.950> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the global thing the universal things so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.910 
the global thing the universal things so
there's<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.300> course<00:00:42.329> slight<00:00:42.750> differences<00:00:43.500> in

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
there's of course slight differences in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
there's of course slight differences in
the<00:00:44.600> happening<00:00:45.600> itself<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:47.030> right<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.210> we're

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the happening itself but right now we're

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.029 
the happening itself but right now we're
at<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.480> mercedes-benz<00:00:48.809> fashion<00:00:49.559> week<00:00:49.590> berlin

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
at the mercedes-benz fashion week berlin

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
at the mercedes-benz fashion week berlin
and<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.090> much<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.170> difference

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and it's not that much of a difference

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.760 
and it's not that much of a difference
in<00:00:53.010> istanbul<00:00:53.760> istanbul<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.230> i

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
in istanbul istanbul is much more i

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.420 
in istanbul istanbul is much more i
think<00:00:56.670> people<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.930> dress<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.559> even<00:00:59.219> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
think people have to dress up even more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
think people have to dress up even more
I<00:00:59.820> mean<00:01:00.000> Berlin<00:01:00.359> fashion<00:01:00.840> week<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I mean Berlin fashion week is really

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
I mean Berlin fashion week is really
like<00:01:01.530> dressing<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> last<00:01:02.430> few<00:01:02.820> years

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
like dressing up for the last few years

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.939 
like dressing up for the last few years
but<00:01:03.510> fashion<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.019> Istanbul<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.500> always

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
but fashion and Istanbul was always

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.420 
but fashion and Istanbul was always
happening<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.460> always<00:01:05.880> big<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
happening was always big so I think that

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
happening was always big so I think that
yeah<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:09.080> don't<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> happening<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.450> maybe

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
yeah I don't know the happening is maybe

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
yeah I don't know the happening is maybe
a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.689> bit<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:12.960> fashionista<00:01:13.710> Merle

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
a little bit more fashionista Merle

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.230 
a little bit more fashionista Merle

actually you you would agree yes I think

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.249 
actually you you would agree yes I think
it's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:20.090> glamorous<00:01:21.140> especially<00:01:22.140> for

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
