00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
high-pressure kit firstly we need to get

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
high-pressure kit firstly we need to get
our<00:00:43.079> unloaded<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:44.010> height<00:00:44.219> measurement<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
our unloaded right height measurement to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
our unloaded right height measurement to
do<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.629> we're<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> measure<00:00:46.440> from<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
do this we're going to measure from the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
do this we're going to measure from the
center<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> hub<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> bottom<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.610 

this<00:00:56.109> is<00:00:56.370> 690<00:00:57.370> millimeters<00:00:57.940> now<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:59.079> light<00:00:59.469> the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
this is 690 millimeters now to light the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:30.980 
this is 690 millimeters now to light the
vehicle

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080
