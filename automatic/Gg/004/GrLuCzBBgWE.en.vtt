00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.420
 the respiratory system of birds is very different from the respiratory system 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.689
 of the other vertebrate limb reaction 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.739
 as the parenchymatous lungs are not present but there are del 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.199
 pulmonary sacs 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.529
 normally the number of 5 copies 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.689
 a cervical couple 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.640
 an anterior thoracic couple a pair under the collarbone which all of them 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.069
 constitute the front bags 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:36.370
 there are sacks and then backs that are made up of an abdominal copy 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.710
 and from a posterior thoracic pair 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.130
 these bags are not the exchange surface that is the one through which 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.510
 it is 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 recovered oxygen eliminated carbon dioxide 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.020
 put constitute a kind of pump 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.100
 which can escape the air rich in oxygen coming from outside 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.150
 bring it to the exchange surface and then talk to me pump it out 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.790
 alor malamente enriched with carbon dioxide produced by the metabolism 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.150
 mobile phone 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
 the task of pumping air into the interior 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.270
 it is charged to the back bags 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.920
 which indeed 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.659
 expanding they suck the air from the outside and I understand they push it 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.000
 towards the exchange surface 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.619
 the exchange surface 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.779
 It consists of tubular structures called para bronchi 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.970
 through the para brunky biello exchange of respiratory gases then of oxygen 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.080
 and carbon dioxide after which the air that passed through these 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.300
 sculptures 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.780
 through 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.660
 the front bags 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.090
 where it is pushed outwards and therefore eliminated 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.040
 there are 5 modes in animal organisms 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.009
 which allow respiratory exchanges 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.369
 the bird's own mode is called many concurrent system 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.299
 in this mode, levietta here 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.710
 year an intersection 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.649
 with blood counts 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:25.200
 and this eur system which is very useful 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.479
 for organizations such as that 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.919
 flight in an oxygen-poor environment 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.889
 normally these animals in fact 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.339
 they fly even at high heights 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:39.749
 in altitude then 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.009
 where the oxygen concentration is lower 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:47.819
 this system being very efficient allows the animal to pick up 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.350
 from the external environment 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.219
 more oxygen 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.199
 this system is also present in the placenta of primates 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.980
 therefore also of the man and it is thanks to these system that the oxygen that 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.509
 circulates in the mother's blood 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.139
 popa to arrive 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.479
 to the 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.600
 rent 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.270
 to the organism that is forming inside the pock
