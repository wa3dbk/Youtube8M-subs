00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.140
 Hello friends with you again I am 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.529
 Today I want to tell you how to wear 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.349
 head any block in my case it 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.179
 pumpkin here but in principle you can wear 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.519
 and command unit can be made to it 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.890
 he named was like something you can see here 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.720
 yes what kind of tea is it for me here that is 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.050
 principle like any armor and she can 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.850
 assign an enchantment something else let's 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.490
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.010
 pumpkin yes let's say a pumpkin can be so 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.230
 for if I want to not pumpkin something else 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.770
 the team here is very small at all 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.720
 simple write river oh there further and 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.360
 Nikita Ie this is 2 without two 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.000
 obligatory words further dog m 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.340
 can write owl k.p. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 here is mine, I will write a dog m so that later 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.260
 show you something 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.960
 further slot armor and choose here 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.000
 heads heads and here we go 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.909
 Haydee unit that you already want to wear 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.550
 on your head let it be for example 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.270
 for example, what will it be than interests 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.890
 Well, for example, I found letters 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.170
 Well, it seems to be such a he 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 I donâ€™t remember the idea, but now I have everything 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.710
 on the head a bookshelf and that's fine 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.409
 just basically on this all in general 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.630
 or not you still want to show them 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.580
 how can you enchant in principle rested here 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.360
 also simply indicates optional 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.979
 int parameter and after: here 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.700
 the square bracket then opens 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.070
 figured 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.909
 and just go enchantment comma 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.970
 that is , his 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.770
 and the power of the name is exactly the same 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 like basically with a ball and with everything 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.330
 the rest are evil : they open the code 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.340
 brace and in quotes you write 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.340
 then it closes and closes 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.290
 the very first test is open principle all 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.850
 elementary but this was all with you 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.100
 once put likes subscribe to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.409
 new videos in the next video waiting for you 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.570
 vundu creative i'll get him now 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.369
 I will quickly demonstrate now 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.319
 I am surviving I can calmly 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.989
 remove as many objects as possible from here 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.420
 just like in creative inventory I can 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.130
 put them back here that is them well in 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 Basically infinitely sword to all my 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.660
 only not yes I can remove it 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.060
 collect coal that's how to do it and all 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.370
 the rest is how it is how it works I am for you 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.830
 I will show in the next video which will be released 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.900
 after you type 30 likes under
