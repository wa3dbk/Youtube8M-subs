concessions<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.960> think<00:04:49.960> Prime<00:04:50.440> Minister

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
concessions I think Prime Minister

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.980 
concessions I think Prime Minister
Netanyahu<00:04:50.980> is<00:04:51.400> actually<00:04:51.760> making<00:04:52.330> some<00:04:52.660> effort

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
Netanyahu is actually making some effort

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.640 
Netanyahu is actually making some effort
to<00:04:53.140> try<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:54.060> move<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.420> little<00:04:55.690> bit<00:04:55.780> further<00:04:56.290> than

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
to try to move a little bit further than

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.210 
to try to move a little bit further than
his<00:04:56.980> coalition<00:04:57.870> wants<00:04:58.870> him<00:04:59.020> to<00:04:59.170> go<00:04:59.320> on<00:04:59.560> the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
his coalition wants him to go on the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.100 
his coalition wants him to go on the
other<00:05:00.280> hand<00:05:00.490> President<00:05:01.300> Abbas<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
other hand President Abbas of the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.110 
other hand President Abbas of the
Palestinian<00:05:02.620> Authority<00:05:02.880> who<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:03.910> think

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
Palestinian Authority who I think

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.750 
Palestinian Authority who I think
genuinely<00:05:04.600> wants<00:05:05.230> peace<00:05:05.500> has<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.310> deal<00:05:06.490> with

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
genuinely wants peace has to deal with

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.810 
genuinely wants peace has to deal with
Hamas<00:05:07.540> an<00:05:08.160> organization<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.190> has<00:05:09.610> not

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
Hamas an organization that has not

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.720 
Hamas an organization that has not
recognized<00:05:10.390> Israel<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:11.110> has<00:05:11.680> not<00:05:12.070> disavowed

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
recognized Israel and has not disavowed

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.350 
recognized Israel and has not disavowed
violence<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.420> so<00:05:14.190> we<00:05:15.190> are<00:05:15.490> working<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:16.150> try<00:05:16.330> to

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
violence and so we are working to try to

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.490 
violence and so we are working to try to
strengthen<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:18.040> ability<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.550> both<00:05:18.940> parties

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
strengthen the ability of both parties

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.530 
strengthen the ability of both parties
to<00:05:20.500> sit<00:05:20.710> down<00:05:20.860> across<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.400> table<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.880> to

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
to sit down across the table and to

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.570 
to sit down across the table and to
begin<00:05:22.690> serious<00:05:23.169> negotiations<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.310> think

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
begin serious negotiations and I think

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.540 
begin serious negotiations and I think
that<00:05:24.820> it's<00:05:25.630> important<00:05:26.260> when<00:05:27.190> we're<00:05:27.340> talking

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
that it's important when we're talking

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.240 
that it's important when we're talking
about<00:05:27.850> this<00:05:28.120> issue<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.660> make<00:05:29.500> sure<00:05:29.770> that<00:05:30.100> we

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
about this issue to make sure that we

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.770
