00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
heracross to sleep just meant that it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
heracross to sleep just meant that it
wasn't<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> threat<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.250> anymore<00:00:35.430> he

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
out on which he'll see he brings out now

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609

and<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.869> sure<00:01:09.930> why<00:01:10.260> he<00:01:10.380> didn't

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

and I'm really not sure why he didn't
switch<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:12.180> bit<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> over

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
switch there then a bit of over

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
switch there then a bit of over
prediction<00:01:13.500> may<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> his<00:01:14.040> part<00:01:14.280> maybe<00:01:14.490> he

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
prediction may be on his part maybe he

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.740 
prediction may be on his part maybe he
thought<00:01:14.850> I'd<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.299> something<00:01:15.659> else

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
thought I'd use something else

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.130 
thought I'd use something else
predicting<00:01:16.380> his<00:01:16.500> switch<00:01:17.240> but<00:01:18.240> yeah<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> get

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
predicting his switch but yeah so I get

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
predicting his switch but yeah so I get
the<00:01:19.229> HP<00:01:19.530> grass<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> he<00:01:20.430> rules<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:21.000> my

him and to get rid of his hip out on and
he<00:01:31.560> doesn't<00:01:31.829> switch<00:01:32.009> again<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.970> i<00:01:33.630> would<00:01:34.049> say

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
he doesn't switch again so i would say

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
he doesn't switch again so i would say
that<00:01:34.439> he's<00:01:34.829> probably<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.520> experienced

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that he's probably not very experienced

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
that he's probably not very experienced
in<00:01:36.540> terms<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> Venus<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.400> but

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
in terms of Venus or what it can do but

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
in terms of Venus or what it can do but
uh<00:01:39.240> i'm<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.200> sure<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.680> expected<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
uh i'm not sure if he expected that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.639 
uh i'm not sure if he expected that
grass<00:01:41.460> knot<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.840> he<00:01:43.140> brings<00:01:43.380> out

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
switch and I don't think so he just

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.120 
switch and I don't think so he just
leaves<00:03:38.450> gyarados<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.140> for<00:03:39.320> death<00:03:39.500> fodder<00:03:39.830> and

really<00:04:42.290> bad<00:04:42.470> enough<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:43.790> just<00:04:44.270> let<00:04:44.479> him<00:04:44.600> drag

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
really bad enough so I just let him drag

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.320 
really bad enough so I just let him drag
a<00:04:45.080> meat-eor<00:04:45.530> me<00:04:45.680> again<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.490> get<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.700> special

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330

attack<00:04:47.630> drop<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:50.180> could<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.540> guess<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.870> could

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
attack drop and I could I guess I could

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.330 
attack drop and I could I guess I could
have<00:04:51.110> switched<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.440> blissey<00:04:51.800> there<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.160> got<00:04:52.310> a

40 instead of 30 but it didn't really

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.370 
40 instead of 30 but it didn't really
