00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.000
 it was actually just across the studies have 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.100
 I fell in love with the piece 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.869
 that was my wish piece in the study 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.310
 should learn it also ups allowed 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.950
 got and made a huge pleasure 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.260
 of course, to work in there and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.239
 I stayed with it and with this piece for 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.300
 for my rehearsal then in the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.300
 run just 20 pieces of the number 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.239
 was my second choice piece 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:57.879
 after the mozart a major concert 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.559
 and that has been very successful 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.809
 actually brought because you once 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.330
 can get started great that the piece goes 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 Well, it's not like that and such a thing 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.290
 Begin fear 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.370
 yes you can immediately in the violin 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.040
 go in and at the same time on very deep 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.280
 I'll say the first one in music 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.530
 first introduction then the topic there is 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.690
 I say several possibilities 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.340
 you could play on the b side 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.830
 you can play that in the first days 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.770
 with stones stearns in the first position 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.430
 very interesting very classy and whole 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.030
 fine 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.070
 You can do that in the style of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.970
 play gremio quite classic or 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 or just like an oistrakh completely on the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.450
 deepening and deepening Russian style 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.080
 and and and heavy as well as first 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.080
 took 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.530
 So I would be quite 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.530
 what lives your called the piece yes 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.090
 and toys in many passages and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.150
 if you look at it now how many 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.540
 Probespieler come with this piece and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.060
 are very successful and good 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.620
 are only moderately difficult to put in it 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.680
 it is for example down here this 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.680
 Passage is very uncomfortable throughout 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.420
 gripped and hard to work with bow 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.870
 finger together and patents anyway and 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 last sentence too and are already a few 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.550
 Hairy hairy passage still in there 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.260
 Overall, it is consistently one 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.260
 heavy piece you have to say no 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.980
 I would be on the spot 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.110
 a very short quote from hermann roth 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.750
 lg always said techno 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.540
 sharing and that is very important thing 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.890
 for example, on this second page 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.840
 Keep going for time 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.970
 dynamics is terribly important that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.959
 go down here this office 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.430
 heed and builds up again and again 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.859
 build up again and again 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.950
 build and that actually stretches 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:22.510
 through the whole piece and the lyrical ones 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.340
 parts very clear , I was very fine 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.650
 interpret and then it may as well 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.900
 really really go to the thing where 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.900
 he also writes here for example 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.849
 with letter the first sentence one 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.459
 triple fortissimo age that is 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.159
 already neat this span 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.500
 the one who draws and that's what I think 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.500
 important that you also go back there 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.110
 in any case because they first of all 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.440
 times the entire development stages of the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.940
 the springs also brings under one roof 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.940
 and that I find that very interesting 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.100
 to be seen as a musician where to do that 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.040
 comes from the east partially double 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.440
 Systems are noted where you get where you are 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.150
 take bow from the upper system and 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.580
 from the first issue from the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.130
 piano score very interesting and you 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.709
 This can be the very individual mission 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.079
 I think that's very good and that 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.650
 actually creates one for the player 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.650
 great flexibility 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.320
 the best 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.060
 had to stop stopped was not 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.730
 lay more because of the pianist 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.440
 and that is really a real one 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.120
 I think profit for everyone 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.120
 rehearsal of the future
