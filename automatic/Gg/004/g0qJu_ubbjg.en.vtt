actually<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:11.100> working<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
actually not working I think as going to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.790 
actually not working I think as going to
do<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.480> fact<00:01:12.660> that<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.870> disconnected<00:01:13.500> halfway

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
do the fact that I disconnected halfway

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.770 
do the fact that I disconnected halfway
through<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> game<00:01:14.190> for<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.240> five<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.600> six

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
through the game for like five or six

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800 
through the game for like five or six
minutes<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.760> that<00:01:17.910> kind<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.120> caused<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
minutes so and that kind of caused it to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.380 
minutes so and that kind of caused it to
I<00:01:19.050> didn't<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:19.860> disconnect<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.430> blue<00:01:21.060> screened

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
