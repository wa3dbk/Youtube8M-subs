00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
reviews the critics reviews to see if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110 
reviews the critics reviews to see if
they<00:03:30.680> liked<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:30.980> or<00:03:31.070> not<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.280> probably<00:03:31.700> should

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
they liked it or not I probably should

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
have I'm hoping that they didn't say it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.560 
have I'm hoping that they didn't say it
was<00:03:33.560> great<00:03:33.769> but<00:03:34.150> sometimes<00:03:35.150> they<00:03:35.360> have<00:03:35.390> a

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
was great but sometimes they have a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.090 
was great but sometimes they have a
different<00:03:35.989> sense<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.380> humor<00:03:36.650> than<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:36.890> do<00:03:36.980> I

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.370 
different sense of humor than I do I
don't<00:03:37.489> know<00:03:37.580> but<00:03:37.820> as<00:03:38.120> parents<00:03:38.570> I<00:03:38.930> think<00:03:38.959> that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
don't know but as parents I think that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.340
