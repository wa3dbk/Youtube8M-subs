on<00:04:20.550> the<00:04:20.670> top<00:04:20.880> shelf<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.390> were<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> bigger<00:04:21.959> box

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
on the top shelf that were a bigger box

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.370 
on the top shelf that were a bigger box
even<00:04:23.430> more<00:04:23.940> detailed<00:04:24.720> clothes<00:04:26.690> that's<00:04:27.690> also<00:04:28.050> I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
even more detailed clothes that's also I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.760 
even more detailed clothes that's also I
mean<00:04:29.300> there's<00:04:30.300> not<00:04:30.480> too<00:04:30.780> much<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.410> found

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
mean there's not too much that I found

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.270 
mean there's not too much that I found
otherwise<00:04:32.370> besides<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.060> eBay<00:04:33.420> and<00:04:33.660> Amazon

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
otherwise besides like eBay and Amazon

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.610 
otherwise besides like eBay and Amazon
so<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.700> guess<00:04:36.090> like<00:04:36.360> they're<00:04:36.600> just<00:04:36.840> at<00:04:37.500> the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
so I guess like they're just at the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.410 
so I guess like they're just at the
content<00:04:37.980> Disney<00:04:38.280> World<00:04:38.550> yes<00:04:38.760> Epcot<00:04:38.940> did<00:04:39.330> the
