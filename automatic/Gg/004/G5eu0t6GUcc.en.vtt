00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:14.929
 Good people, but do not let them be 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.240
 welcome to another day of fall 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 Dunga I know I should not have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.960
 bought more books month but already has a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 Good explanation I swear one came down 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.010
 I needed to buy a gift from there. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 buy the gift in the submarine and I already 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 it was getting kind of expensive and if I 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.900
 buy a little more 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 I already got it will be the end and I prefer 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 spend money on books than spend 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.710
 money in freight then you have yes with me 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 It was a good cause that package arrived that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 has four books in here I 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.120
 I believe that in the coming months not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 I managed to stay a little longer and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 find book so expect but it is not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.610
 promise and let's see if the package that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.870
 to show you what's arrived 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.719
 1 occurs today that the package is really 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 who speaks much of this book is the VITRO 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.210
 middle of vic flick 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 He says it's one of his favorite books. 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 From him and from what I understand so far. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.380
 this book tells the story of a guy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 that he relives the same life several times 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.430
 he always comes back from a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.990
 certain point in his life I do not know 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.939
 he always ends up making choices 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 different from how he will live life 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.229
 of them that time I'm very very 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 curious problem is there 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.159
 first book pot broke out of here 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 a close lord who is advanced john 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.979
 Miguel, I think I'm going to cry from plastic. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.460
 here because it is using light reflection and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.710
 without ever getting my cover right 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.659
 next to the river this book here for those who 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 do not know the original name the hollies it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.770
 had an adaptation to the cinemas with the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.649
 the clip he tells the story of a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.290
 that his wife was raped and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.210
 murdered and everything indicates that it was 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 who committed the crime and one day he wakes up 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 with two horns being born in his head 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.930
 and a strange ability of people 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.939
 confessing to him all the time in the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.650
 I do not usually read anything much on the street. 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.990
 scary very macabre enters with 10 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.910
 the police station book but I saw a video of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.470
 the time it takes to leave the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.660
 link from her video down here in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 description that made me very curious to 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.970
 respect that book that next book 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 this edition pocket time of bologna in the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.960
 field of rye in several interviews 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.880
 that what a great ring he always 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.830
 says his favorite book by 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.300
 the less book goes his favorite is the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.830
 Catcher in the rye field and he 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.930
 was being cheated 20 reais in the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.460
 submarine sat with great things is a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.690
 technical profile but it's an English book 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.950
 It's a book that I had a lot of 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.900
 Curious to read and I ended up 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.459
 buying and I think it ends well here. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.140
 You look cute. 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.990
 Let's see how I take it to you. 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.910
 I found this book and the last one it has. 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.010
 pilot is not greater than 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.910
 he imagined that he would be in all light 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.920
 we can not live this book here he 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.870
 it is there that being quoted for 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.150
 to win the pulitzer this year he won the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.340
 jury award says do not think better 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.200
 Last year's fiction from what I read in 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.090
 synopsis I just know it's a guy that he 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.790
 takes care of a museum near the time of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.980
 and has a blind and 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 he creates a model for the blind daughter 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.989
 for her to be in the neighborhood and orientale 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.090
 I managed to walk alone and that's it 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.800
 comes the war and probably everyone 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.470
 suffers a lot in this story then 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.570
 I know it 's a little bigger than I expected 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.430
 let's rather expensive it soon and how to 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680
 You here if it 's good if it's all right. 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.170
 or if it 's not just going there we'll see 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.209
 hopefully well worth these people night 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.220
 were the books that came out were boxing 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.440
 very quickly I think this is a boxing 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.269
 that I did during the closure has this one 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.620
 and another from a video that I call 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.060
 few days ago 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.370
 How are we going to work a little high? 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.650
 but that maybe he does, but at least one 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.540
 Notice you here is the question is in the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.250
 video of today if you do not why not 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.870

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.950

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.790
