00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.080
 This is a win that you have several 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.769
 to joy and satisfaction 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.809
 leads it goes then called a thin one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.959
 against an opponent that it whole 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.150
 difficult to play is history 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.120
 namely always says that twente again 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
 A plow is the one that you find very difficult 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.690
 can win 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 and if you like that he is 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.840
 not at all 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.189
 not in a way like all of us 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.720
 very much like to see it in a way that 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 another way what one 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.170
 you also like rotterdam that is 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
 namely 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 yes fighting and it was him again today 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.780
 have a bit in fact match like 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 you then the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 can close with three points then 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.360
 I think that's right here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.040
 who are you on what your clue that are 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.870
 son went on to play it so completely 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.129
 paper at least well I am natural 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 well i am coming from twente and then my 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.220
 little brother internship 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.809
 disappoint then you still have some muscles 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.570
 take a walk 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.339
 I looked into a certain point in that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.430
 The media came out that they had a large competition 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 I had a sense of van 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 nasa will sometimes be able to do something else 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.190
 to do and also entered 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.850
 how I then look at a team like 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.200
 twente with with types of players who animals 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 maybe very suitable for 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.650
 to be 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.570
 and then you get a whole today 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
 depressed and committed to being with 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 five times in the back where he plays 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.890
 hard to play against is it was 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 fight then you get namely or 435 one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.939
 penalty and then you miss for the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.689
 a penalty a fifth time in a row 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.719
 with that 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.119
 I don't want that for most 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.979
 my second time but for it 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.509
 Past says it's been up five times 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.280
 you drive so yes there is very difficult 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.509
 to answer them 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.789
 I honestly hope for this now 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.100
 not really busy with it 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.390
 my car in itself again that we three 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 have grabbed points and I think so 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.749
 the most important thing is but it is 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.609
 what you are going to discuss were you 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.140
 with that in the arena last week at 0 0 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.609
 to 1 and 7 pm you will get it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.429
 useful if this involves training 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.229
 when lures you go 60 yourself 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.390
 then attract budget 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.010
 then i see him in then it makes it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.319
 after all, a world core 2 of 8 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.580
 and they actually come on the radio 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.900
 Nicole Jansen who says what was that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.239
 good today in every way 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 pushing that opinion yes I can again 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.569
 explain you which goal 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.830
 yes that is always nice because me 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.629
 I understood what you are going to say 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.489
 her sometimes one understands the state where he is 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.780
 kind of that that the media is about 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.150
 find very annoying 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.129
 if you fly all the way to dubai and you 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.620
 want all the training you want viewed 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.500
 filming and then it was just a moment 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.920
 where what a co- articles professional 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 yes very convenient is a moment 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.790
 special cameras without media and if 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.599
 today we are reaping the benefits 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.129
 can pick 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.900
 if that he had nice and intended 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.910
 more on the corners and free kicks that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.489
 we must trend in such a world dubai 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.750
 could emerce sun than media I understand 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.160
 I want him if you help and I do it 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.660
 not bad either but sometimes it is 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.420
 it sentenced very very quickly and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.220
 but yes well that 's us 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.750
 kikkerlandje if you visit the whole week 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.310
 week decided to train and win the league 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.510
 we go to the people thereon 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.640
 you walk 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.440
 are you going to run lou more well now 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.040
 then you know how drunk , but yes 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.239
 he would be on you then but you go first 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.650
 jan is good it is good hold a bit 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.599
 out of the wind and all our bodies whatever 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.010
 filming you also like just such good I 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.319
 find everything best 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.819
 then the second half in it starts 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.169
 For a moment , Vermeer always has it that way 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.489
 is good release a ball 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.180
 yes that's right yes the die boom that die 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.000
 First of all I went wrong already 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.889
 got in in in in a deep pass 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.230
 those that fit I thought that was boar 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.880
 stepped and and buddha he remained something 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.060
 hanging behind I was not angry with us 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.430
 and then 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.010
 yes that shoots here and let him go 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.190
 and angel az is very good at that 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.110
 well that happens then and afterwards 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.190
 react very well 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.230
 you must be boloboost afraid of that 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.700
 he didn't want you to play there well because 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.530
 namely 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.959
 like you just indicated that i like something 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.910
 expect from twente and she with 2 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.910
 pointed to play and that 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.760
 for us, in optics, it is better 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.819
 this that bulla 'what played inside 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.410
 say to jensen on the outside 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.060
 there the man or caught by which we 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.010
 could still have a free man in the back 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.079
 because because if you with one 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.030
 with two in front and one behind 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.040
 I see that it is possible 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.080
 all i times are definitely the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.169
 circumstances today 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.070
 this is a smooth mistake and then you can 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.660
 everyone made a mistake once in a while 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.270
 make or slip and then you cannot 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.240
 fix more if you go into it 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.610
 that is why the choice is for 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.290
 from moulin rouge list and entered what 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.970
 he before the winter break 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.220
 yes just very pretty 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.640
 you know it has been 10 years 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.100
 ago it 's so far wind in arena 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.900
 cold and your erwin koeman can train them 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.110
 you also know it was 10 years ago 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.940
 that we have hibernated european 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.470
 so that his mountain promises makes him happy 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.860
 the the number 8 all those all those who 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.750
 statistics that you sometimes have to knock over 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.800
 throw poles for a week and be me 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.800
 pay for every drink 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.010
 I don't drink that much so it seems to me 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.850
 roads start with the cheap bowl 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.850
 talking about cheap
