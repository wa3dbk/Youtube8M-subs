it's<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.170> 12<00:00:22.500> people<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.369> pieces<00:00:23.609> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
interesting looking I might try to get a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719 
interesting looking I might try to get a
bite<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.750> everything<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.310> I've

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
bite that has everything all right I've

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179 
bite that has everything all right I've
got<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.150> stacked<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:22.020> pineapple<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
got I stacked some pineapple and a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
got I stacked some pineapple and a
jalapeno<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.210> got<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> burnt

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
jalapeno on there it's got the burnt

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.030 
jalapeno on there it's got the burnt
area<00:01:24.930> too<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> guess<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> part<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
area too but I guess that's a part of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.719 
area too but I guess that's a part of
the<00:01:26.100> deal<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.210> let's<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.729> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the deal so here we go let's do it that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.690 
the deal so here we go let's do it that
is<00:01:30.000> rather<00:01:30.479> nice<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.079> never<00:01:31.619> thought<00:01:31.920> jalapenos

is rather nice I never thought jalapenos

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.999 
is rather nice I never thought jalapenos
in<00:01:32.729> pineapple<00:01:33.090> would<00:01:33.659> work<00:01:33.869> together<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
in pineapple would work together but on

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
in pineapple would work together but on
