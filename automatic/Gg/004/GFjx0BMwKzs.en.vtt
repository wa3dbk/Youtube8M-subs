00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay in this video I want to show you

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay in this video I want to show you
the<00:00:03.659> difference<00:00:04.140> about<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:05.100> features<00:00:05.609> that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
the difference about the features that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.950 
the difference about the features that
the<00:00:06.180> auto<00:00:06.569> has<00:00:07.020> where<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.250> control

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
the auto has where you have control

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.129 
the auto has where you have control
which<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:09.990> critical<00:00:10.530> for<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.040> which<00:00:11.670> is

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
which is critical for you which is

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.340 
which is critical for you which is
different<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.580> what<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
different from what you have here in the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.769 
different from what you have here in the
res<00:00:16.560> map<00:00:16.800> auto<00:00:17.039> set<00:00:17.369> okay<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.390> let<00:00:18.539> me<00:00:18.570> just

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
res map auto set okay so let me just

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.279 
res map auto set okay so let me just
jump<00:00:19.020> right<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.150> flex<00:00:21.570> if

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
jump right in the first one is a flex if

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.849 
jump right in the first one is a flex if
you<00:00:22.500> hit<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.859> flex<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.990> basically<00:00:25.560> allows

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you hit a flex and this basically allows

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.240 
you hit a flex and this basically allows
you<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> change<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.480> flag<00:00:27.840> setting<00:00:28.320> okay

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you to change your a flag setting okay

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
you to change your a flag setting okay
that<00:00:29.429> means<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.939> enables<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> chair<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
that means it enables you to chair to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.459 
that means it enables you to chair to
make<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.980> easier<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.110> exhale<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
make it easier for you to exhale and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
make it easier for you to exhale and
make<00:00:35.100> breathing<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.640> lot<00:00:35.820> more<00:00:36.000> natural<00:00:36.510> okay

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
make breathing a lot more natural okay

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
make breathing a lot more natural okay
so<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.100> change<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.670> number<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so you can change this number but what I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
so you can change this number but what I
really<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.070> part<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.850> flex

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really like is this part here a flex

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
really like is this part here a flex

for example it is set for five the RAM
pressure<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.360> five<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:13.780> drop<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.290> five

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
pressure of five would drop it to five

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.250 
pressure of five would drop it to five
and<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.700> doctor<00:02:16.030> will<00:02:16.150> tell<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.540> will<00:02:17.050> tell

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and the doctor will tell you will tell

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.350 
and the doctor will tell you will tell
us<00:02:17.290> how<00:02:17.560> long<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:18.040> set<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.610> for<00:02:18.910> example

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
us how long to set it for for example

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.870 
us how long to set it for for example
twenty<00:02:19.630> minutes<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.620> over<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.100> next<00:02:21.310> 20

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
twenty minutes and over the next 20

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.150 
twenty minutes and over the next 20
minutes<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.900> gonna<00:02:23.230> start<00:02:23.650> climbing<00:02:23.950> up

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
minutes it's gonna start climbing up

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.730 
minutes it's gonna start climbing up
five<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:25.000> know<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.720> palpable<00:02:26.350> pump

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
five you know it's a palpable pump

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.040 
five you know it's a palpable pump
starts<00:02:27.010> climbing<00:02:27.190> up<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.670> ten<00:02:27.970> okay

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
starts climbing up to ten okay

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.770 
starts climbing up to ten okay
this<00:02:29.410> helps<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.950> easier<00:02:30.580> for<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.420> used

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
this helps it easier for you to get used

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.200 
this helps it easier for you to get used
to<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.830> don't<00:02:33.010> feel<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.000> a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
to this so you don't feel like it's a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.910 
to this so you don't feel like it's a
tornado<00:02:34.810> blowing<00:02:35.320> down<00:02:35.560> your<00:02:35.800> face<00:02:36.070> now

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
ramp pressure or even for you you might

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.960 
ramp pressure or even for you you might
find<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.530> right<00:02:59.740> you<00:02:59.830> like<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.130> ramp<00:03:00.610> feature

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
find the right you like the ramp feature

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.510 
find the right you like the ramp feature
but<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.420> find<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.810> too<00:03:02.080> weak<00:03:02.410> it's<00:03:02.950> not<00:03:03.190> enough

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
but you find it too weak it's not enough

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.930 
but you find it too weak it's not enough

Auto<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.540> can<00:03:07.720> change<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.800> press<00:03:09.100> that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
Auto you can change it so you press that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.780 
Auto you can change it so you press that
and<00:03:09.550> see<00:03:10.240> you<00:03:10.330> can<00:03:10.510> change<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.610> okay

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
and see you can change it okay

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.160 
and see you can change it okay
now<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.360> difference<00:03:14.050> here<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.710> in<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
now the difference here is in in the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.650 
now the difference here is in in the

you<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.500> change<00:03:20.920> not<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.940> ramp<00:03:22.270> pressure<00:03:22.660> but

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
you can change not the ramp pressure but

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.540 
you can change not the ramp pressure but
the<00:03:23.170> time<00:03:23.530> remember<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:23.980> was<00:03:24.100> giving<00:03:24.460> an

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
the time remember I was giving an

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.440 
the time remember I was giving an
example<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.090> 20<00:03:25.420> minutes<00:03:25.720> well<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:27.310> can<00:03:27.550> you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
example of 20 minutes well you can you

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.560 
example of 20 minutes well you can you
can<00:03:28.630> change<00:03:28.960> it<00:03:29.140> from<00:03:29.350> 20<00:03:29.620> minutes<00:03:31.200> 15<00:03:32.200> minutes

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
can change it from 20 minutes 15 minutes

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.760 
can change it from 20 minutes 15 minutes
okay<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.630> see<00:03:35.020> what<00:03:35.140> I'm<00:03:35.230> saying<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.530> can<00:03:35.680> go

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
okay you see what I'm saying you can go

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.520 
okay you see what I'm saying you can go
as<00:03:35.890> high<00:03:35.920> as<00:03:36.070> 40<00:03:36.430> minutes<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.790> believe<00:03:36.960> but<00:03:37.960> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
as high as 40 minutes I believe but you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.780 
as high as 40 minutes I believe but you
can<00:03:38.710> change<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.310> time<00:03:39.820> but<00:03:40.300> not<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.840> strength

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
can change the time but not the strength

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.030 
can change the time but not the strength
over<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.340> change<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:46.150> strength

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
over here you can change the strength

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.840 
over here you can change the strength
but<00:03:48.040> not<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.610> time<00:03:49.000> okay<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:51.550> see<00:03:51.700> this

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
but not the time okay so you see this

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.090 
but not the time okay so you see this
number<00:03:52.240> here<00:03:52.420> that's<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.080> strength<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
number here that's the strength of the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.580 
number here that's the strength of the
ramp<00:03:54.340> pressure<00:03:54.790> starting<00:03:55.330> pressure<00:03:55.570> okay<00:03:56.050> so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
ramp pressure starting pressure okay so

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.300 
ramp pressure starting pressure okay so
that's<00:03:56.770> the<00:03:56.860> difference

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
that's the difference

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.050 
that's the difference
tubing<00:03:58.180> type<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.830> must<00:04:00.100> register<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:01.000> you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
tubing type it you must register if you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.510 
tubing type it you must register if you
