00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:21.900
 hello to all tankers with you hamish and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:25.470
 Today we have a video on the tank of all of our 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.939
 good scoop think to know all this tank 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.439
 in general, look very good fight 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.149
 the guy pulled I think that's my good 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.480
 friend 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:40.379
 according to vitz cash loki played when 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 was in the bath and indeed there were periods 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.579
 when played on it in general the chances of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.960
 victory is not very good as you can see 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.450
 40 percent and respectively from 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 rests on two tops 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 our team in enemy in enemy 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.469
 as you can see naturally that is better than 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.530
 we are of course very regrettable therefore 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.820
 more still imposed 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.290
 responsibility on our isa 7 which 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 exactly my soklan 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.460
 and the second is-7 is very sad because 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.369
 he has all 830 efficiency 49 percent at 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.310
 eight kbf in this little control i 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.140
 I understand if there are few fights of small length 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.190
 crunch well then there are less than a thousand when i 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 already 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:29.430
 take it off seriously see what 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.300
 happens in general is-7 all break on 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 your go more precisely on your way on the go 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.270
 along the way something like this is generally correct 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.930
 is trying to target 50100 anyone at all for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 home somewhere really vazik 102 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.590
 drives him pass without problems from 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 everyone would not even react to him I would 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.600
 appointed 31 shaft account so meager 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.330
 Generally 02 at first nothing is clear 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.000
 Tries to fight dogs in NLD 2 110 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.030
 e 4 but nothing happens at the company 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 music t110 4 gets out gift duarte 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.600
 well thrown off on her leaves from 7 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.690
 without sight 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.230
 without anything loosely he leaves in 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.069
 hangar 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.590
 vanshot as seen just in the forehead like this 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.000
 But in general you know scoops from and for example and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.209
 started for acero fours from isa 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.470
 third scoop vshotit a to b often 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.530
 that is, from 8 out of 3 out of 7 wanshot in sides 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.269
 44 write a chock of their 62-ka vanshot in the side 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.670
 pretty often the same here 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.970
 situation 2000 damage but as from a bush 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.970
 thus the top goes to the hangar with this 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.019
 the whole action begins 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.280
 trying to tank T110 4 then is that 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:06.450
 all the same is successful he even 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.090
 breeds is a 7 on a shot of 7 too 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.130
 trying to tank overboard 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.549
 Find minutes for more effective than on e4 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.650
 but nevertheless on the carrier he even 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.600
 strongly pull more accurately you could board something 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.160
 you can not pierce it or just feed 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.519
 room because there is a screen and all 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
 crap 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.180
 from a pistol 4 if it turns strongly 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.269
 it will be broken better shot after all in 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.660
 board because the tower there is very strong 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.660
 but nothing 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.960
 sorry i'm 4 completely tower 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.750
 turns on nothing to watch the general 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.120
 in nld of all kills action test 4 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.390
 thereby taking the two tops the most 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.180
 important opponents with the odds 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.880
 40 percent if you pick at least one 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.770
 top of 2 with the fact that there are only two Sans 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.560
 approximately doubles because 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.840
 all responsibility is on top 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.490
 as you can see this very good tank proceeding 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.980
 even from this although it is still about nothing 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.380
 speaks with his two shots but shots 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.860
 there were four more somewhere but none 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.020
 less 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.160
 shot which were effective with 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.420
 damage was only two 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.420
 vertical alignment angles here in general 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:23.420
 no, as you can see here is somehow strange 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:28.910
 it turns out see hit gwt 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.840
 apparently in the gun but it happens and this is nothing 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.270
 when i'm pretty sad here 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.140
 as you can see, this one with a penny of seconds 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.140
 almost 12 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.440
 dvd goes to the hangar 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.080
 In principle, problems can now 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.189
 make only lorraine and everything as 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.710
 UAZ 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.439
 and 44 if I am not mistaken myself 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.800
 correctly said yes they are with very bad 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.800
 efficiency 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:05.060
 212 enters the hangar, too, by the way of 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.710
 all still in shock he writes somewhere 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.360
 bummed he really wonders at all 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.060
 in fact, everyone saw that it was a forehead 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.509
 hull but maybe not head to head towers well 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.900
 in short it was happiness this most 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.710
 the main thing is 3000 damage is good that is 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.849
 top you need to do at least your hepe 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.900
 if you do less than your hepe 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.879
 cooking at home is no longer serious here 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.870
 It turns out already a beautiful murder 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:38.719
 Basically, you antes killed two tops that 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.870
 gives us at once a paskuchchi medal almost 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:46.310
 warrior well, of course, this is not the end 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.020
 From lorraine 40t lila I donâ€™t know how 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.599
 right to me the tower from the word and in general 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.960
 no matter how right goes too 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.440
 hangar 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.849
 the only dangerous surviving opponent 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.870
 although how to tell them the poster well, just 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.629
 more or less adequate to which six 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.839
 frags already by the way suck bent 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.620
 Only one vazik remains in the light as you see 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:12.550
 he was after us in this square 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.550
 most likely it is full 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.910
 maybe a little campaign virgin soil on Smolenka 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.900
 no one was therefore more likely 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.900
 altogether he is full 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.690
 and everyone still puzzled UAZ 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.320
 filed a flare from the walls of which they killed 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.210
 bk not 67 for these no problems 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.930
 breaks through and why debt you need to find them 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.660
 I don't understand IS-7 is enough for him 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.460
 490 damage and 260 penetration as possible 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.330
 to complain at all that we are some kind of gold 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.280
 need all the crap he and so beautiful 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.680
 everyone arrives and the gun is very good 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.169
 stabilized very good damage she 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.820
 very pleased in this regard, I said 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.910
 better than isa fourth though 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.520
 principle of 4 more people like in 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.180
 gun plan like this 7 frags four 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.260
 thousand seven hundred eighty five damage 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.760
 medal paskuchchi victory and dragged everyone 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.190
 buy so pump out in everything 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.380
 thanks for watching don't forget 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.750
 subscribe to the channel if you have something 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.120
 more than 50 percent more than a thousand one hundred 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.570
 efficiency leave a request clans necessarily 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.570
 perceive
