00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.400
 what 's up with friends derbys at the start 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.670
 many of you have the tutorial 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.700
 desired for the oven I on the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.230
 built strong server and I have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
 always rebuilt here and become you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.340
 right over here as well 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.449
 the tree briefly, I would like to in a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 to enter the function 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.769
 Throw the coal in here then the whole 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 automatically distributed to all ovens 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.699
 becomes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.869
 I had already during the test run 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.290
 but as you can see , everywhere is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.489
 same number of coal in it 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.820
 if you do this up here now 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.590
 that you want to melt it will 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 Immediately see that all ovens at the same time 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.530
 yes, there is everywhere here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.329
 iron ore in there now everywhere 2 shares 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 always keeps everything steady on that is 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 nice and fast and here with one 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 little item innovator gets here all 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.809
 finished things here in the box immediately 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.770
 with the tutorial so next time 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.799
 needs the sun 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.119
 twice 3 field where you have your tests 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.760
 you wanted to go here and here one goes 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 the back and place the chest 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.770
 Let's start here first 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.710
 on 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.170
 I am well prepared with the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:33.350
 item elevator there are two droppers 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:36.630
 the two upwards show so and so 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:42.689
 then you need the blog here yet 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 a blog there you need it now 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.220
 a computer you here in this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 Gaps fill here needs us all 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.259
 blocks from which we then here 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.890
 Repeater take two tickets 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.840
 redstone back in the completely back 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.220
 here a redstone with a repeater of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.180
 then remains normal 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.619
 here comes a torch in the blog 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.360
 hit the path and had a torch 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.700
 then would have to click once to hear so 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.000
 how could I test it all? 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.790
 do not know 16 here 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 stonebridge labs one if it looks like this 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.740
 then it works you should then the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 16 pieces in the chest sow without that 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.240
 you've heard the click done well 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.590
 we continue with the yards 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.650
 this you just need the luck to 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:49.160
 Let's start here at the place you are in block 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.330
 and then the eight stoves 3 4 5 6 7 8 den 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
 block no longer needed can 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.150
 take away now you take it already 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.350
 your hopper places those below 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.930
 It is important that all of them are important 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.800
 show each other as you can see 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.420
 all in the top rows 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:11.810
 then it always goes up here 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.610
 showing a hopper in the same way above 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.140
 here a back all have to go into the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:26.030
 show back then so i need 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:29.120
 now my blocks again so then 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.590
 you place a blog here and there 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.769
 in block that was nonsense in the about 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.830
 in the hofer the last two in the row 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.120
 show in the lower hopper and all 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.950
 others who come here now 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.750
 always show in those before 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.630
 I show it the same thing one 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.330
 better perspective of pointing down 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.799
 everyone else so you can 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.160
 always go forward and the shoppe 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:01.370
 once put this way does the same 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.230
 Now here's just below the just then 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.660
 Do you go in the back seated there 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.049
 blog there in the block is there on both 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.470
 block a compressor on it again 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.600
 pass the complete blog 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.810
 Each of these blocks comes to you 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.579
 an outside a gate to the gate 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.530
 here comes a blog on it comes in 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.800
 blog and here comes one 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.900
 then this redstone puts down and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.960
 could hoppern next to this whole 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.740
 then place blocks here 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.420
 redstone grow 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.500
 We will do the same on the other 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.460
 then block then block then block 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.460
 and here again the line 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.000
 the whole thing would have to look like this 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:03.380
 then enter here placed here above 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.780
 complete here a blog me 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.200
 said a blog here and behind it 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:14.090
 Computer then you need stick slopes 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:17.530
 Two pieces of the number became one here 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.530
 get here and here 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:31.460
 here comes a blog and to the 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:33.080
 another one last blog i do that 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.720
 Everything gets out of hand because of that 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.930
 I now and then a bit so now 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.410
 can you put a blog in here and 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.970
 here 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:47.419
 Here comes turn on here 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.100
 Peter then comes in here in a block 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.370
 because you have to block off here once because 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.850
 is here and it still comes here sometimes 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.840
 A block with a redstone torch 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.590
 now here again the need 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.590
 conscience 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.990
 one comes here and the other 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.180
 it comes to the same soul, why you come 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.860
 just a blog of this 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.580
 Redstone cuts her when the whole thing 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.090
 building story just now it works 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.180
 continue here 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.190
 Now you have to snaps 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.110
 use which labs does not matter 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.270
 but now it is important that you 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.080
 used snaps and indeed comes here 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.370
 after all, the congress on it then 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.240
 come here one 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:43.230
 there comes redstone on it then we can 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:47.180
 once here so long and then come here 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.020
 a blog with a torch on it 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:54.150
 and here's a blog and are 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.260
 done well it's not exactly the same 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.740
 because the above is a bit different 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.900
 so you save a whole 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:06.690
 redstone but the function is the same 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:13.590
 I'll show you the first name first 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:17.660
 coal into the coal a piece of iron like that 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.660
 and that should start now 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.350
 I hope this tutorial has you 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.300
 please if you like 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.460
 suggestions for improvement for my for 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.450
 my tutorial you can me the 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.460
 like to write in the comments 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:34.170
 otherwise wish you much fun 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.030
 this highly efficient oven and yes 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.500
 I would say we'll see each other 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.500
 see you again next time
