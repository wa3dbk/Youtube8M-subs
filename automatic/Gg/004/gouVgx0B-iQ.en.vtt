00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
yeah and these were seven dollars so

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.610 
yeah and these were seven dollars so
these<00:03:56.459> were<00:03:56.670> probably<00:03:56.850> 350<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.049> last<00:03:58.350> pair<00:03:58.590> i

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
these were probably 350 the last pair i

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.120 
these were probably 350 the last pair i
got<00:03:58.920> it's<00:03:59.160> actually<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> little<00:04:00.060> unique<00:04:01.019> for<00:04:01.920> me

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
got it's actually a little unique for me

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.610 
got it's actually a little unique for me
um<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:03.120> picked<00:04:03.720> them<00:04:03.840> up<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.109> they<00:04:04.470> were

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
um I picked them up because they were

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.990 
um I picked them up because they were
unique<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.160> they<00:04:05.370> were<00:04:05.430> something<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:05.880> I

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
unique and they were something that I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.530 
unique and they were something that I
traditionally<00:04:06.900> would<00:04:07.170> never<00:04:07.440> wear<00:04:07.799> um

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
traditionally would never wear um

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.349 
traditionally would never wear um
they're<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:10.139> I<00:04:10.670> guess<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.850> could<00:04:12.060> say

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
they're these I guess you could say

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.129 
they're these I guess you could say
cylinder<00:04:13.319> or<00:04:14.359> three-dimensional<00:04:15.359> triangles

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
cylinder or three-dimensional triangles

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.420 
cylinder or three-dimensional triangles
so<00:04:17.040> um

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
so um

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.189 
so um
pretty<00:04:19.430> much<00:04:19.639> you<00:04:19.969> stick<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.389> in<00:04:20.509> your<00:04:20.629> ear<00:04:20.930> and

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
pretty much you stick it in your ear and

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.020 
pretty much you stick it in your ear and
it<00:04:21.469> just<00:04:21.739> kind<00:04:22.009> of<00:04:22.069> like<00:04:22.250> sticks<00:04:22.610> through<00:04:22.849> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
it just kind of like sticks through the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.399 
it just kind of like sticks through the
back<00:04:23.210> kind<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.199> like<00:04:24.560> how<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.949> is<00:04:25.189> in<00:04:25.460> this

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
back kind of like how it is in this

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.339 
back kind of like how it is in this
holder<00:04:27.409> here<00:04:27.710> one<00:04:28.460> side<00:04:28.849> of<00:04:28.879> it<00:04:29.180> will<00:04:29.389> be<00:04:29.840> kind

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
holder here one side of it will be kind

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.719 
holder here one side of it will be kind
of<00:04:30.409> like<00:04:30.530> shooting<00:04:30.919> up<00:04:31.069> and<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> other<00:04:31.580> side

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
of like shooting up and the other side

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.600 
of like shooting up and the other side
of<00:04:31.759> it<00:04:31.939> will<00:04:32.120> be<00:04:32.240> down<00:04:32.479> so<00:04:33.039> yeah<00:04:34.039> I'm<00:04:34.280> looking

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
of it will be down so yeah I'm looking

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.070 
of it will be down so yeah I'm looking
forward<00:04:34.819> to<00:04:34.969> trying<00:04:35.210> them<00:04:35.509> out<00:04:35.599> because<00:04:35.840> they

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
forward to trying them out because they

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.480 
forward to trying them out because they
are<00:04:36.259> so<00:04:36.590> different<00:04:36.830> from<00:04:37.129> what<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.370> normally

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
are so different from what I normally

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.540 
are so different from what I normally
would<00:04:38.060> wear<00:04:38.270> um<00:04:38.960> but<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.590> think<00:04:40.039> it<00:04:40.189> will<00:04:40.310> look

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
would wear um but I think it will look

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.610 
would wear um but I think it will look
nice<00:04:40.819> depending<00:04:41.389> on<00:04:41.389> how<00:04:41.719> I<00:04:41.750> decide<00:04:42.259> to<00:04:42.289> wear

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
nice depending on how I decide to wear

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.559 
nice depending on how I decide to wear
it<00:04:42.770> most<00:04:43.280> likely<00:04:43.490> these<00:04:43.699> will<00:04:43.879> be<00:04:44.000> worn<00:04:44.330> when

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
it most likely these will be worn when

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.080 
it most likely these will be worn when
my<00:04:44.719> hair<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.020> up<00:04:45.439> versus<00:04:46.219> keep<00:04:46.580> my<00:04:46.699> hair<00:04:46.909> being
