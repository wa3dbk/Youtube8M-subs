00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
eyeliner so let's see if that works

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.370 
eyeliner so let's see if that works
because<00:03:59.890> you<00:03:59.920> know<00:04:00.040> elf<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.460> pretty<00:04:00.670> cheap<00:04:01.380> so

because you know elf is pretty cheap so

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.970 
because you know elf is pretty cheap so

I'm just going to dip this in my steal a

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.740 
I'm just going to dip this in my steal a
powder<00:04:09.390> this<00:04:10.390> stuff<00:04:10.630> is<00:04:10.750> getting<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.530> ugly<00:04:11.950> now

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
powder this stuff is getting so ugly now

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.840 
powder this stuff is getting so ugly now
it's<00:04:13.750> not<00:04:13.900> really<00:04:14.170> going<00:04:14.560> on<00:04:14.830> at<00:04:15.130> all<00:04:15.400> onto

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
it's not really going on at all onto

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.289 
it's not really going on at all onto
this<00:04:15.970> thing<00:04:17.100> but<00:04:18.100> we<00:04:18.280> shall<00:04:18.520> see<00:04:18.850> if<00:04:19.150> this

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
this thing but we shall see if this

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.750 
this thing but we shall see if this
works<00:04:20.190> let's<00:04:21.190> try<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.430> on<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:21.580> other<00:04:21.820> eye

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
works let's try it on the other eye

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.470 
works let's try it on the other eye
no<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.990> didn't<00:04:26.500> work<00:04:26.530> either<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:28.300> maybe

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
no so that didn't work either so maybe

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.590 
no so that didn't work either so maybe
you<00:04:28.840> do<00:04:29.080> have<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.430> let's<00:04:30.910> get<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.150> chunk<00:04:31.450> out

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
you do have to let's get that chunk out

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.050 
you do have to let's get that chunk out
whatever<00:04:31.780> maybe<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.860> do<00:04:33.100> have<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.730> get<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
whatever maybe you do have to get the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.050 
whatever maybe you do have to get the
liquid<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.870> thought<00:04:35.410> maybe<00:04:35.800> they<00:04:36.760> were<00:04:36.880> just

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
liquid I thought maybe they were just

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.710 
liquid I thought maybe they were just
trying<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.390> sell<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.780> expensive<00:04:38.710> water<00:04:39.720> but

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
trying to sell you expensive water but

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.930 
trying to sell you expensive water but
like<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.740> looks<00:04:41.890> pretty<00:04:42.280> when<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.550> light<00:04:42.730> hits

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
like it looks pretty when the light hits

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.760 
like it looks pretty when the light hits
it<00:04:43.000> cuz<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.240> guys<00:04:43.330> can<00:04:43.540> kind<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.810> see<00:04:43.990> but<00:04:44.620> it's

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
it cuz you guys can kind of see but it's

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.150 
it cuz you guys can kind of see but it's
not<00:04:44.980> like<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.160> continuous<00:04:45.730> line<00:04:46.030> like<00:04:47.010> just<00:04:48.010> try

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
not like a continuous line like just try

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.520 
not like a continuous line like just try
this<00:04:48.220> one<00:04:48.550> more<00:04:48.700> time<00:04:48.970> now<00:04:49.930> that<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.200> brush<00:04:50.380> is

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
this one more time now that the brush is

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.570 
this one more time now that the brush is
kind<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.800> dry<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:52.810> might<00:04:53.110> work<00:04:53.770> better<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.340> might

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
kind of dry it might work better I might

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.960 
kind of dry it might work better I might
have<00:04:54.670> gotten<00:04:54.880> it<00:04:55.060> too<00:04:55.360> wet<00:04:56.670> where<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.730> could<00:04:57.850> be

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
have gotten it too wet where it could be

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.560 
have gotten it too wet where it could be

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
would be worth the money because it's

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.940 
would be worth the money because it's
kind<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.630> stupid<00:05:19.630> to<00:05:19.900> have<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.290> stuff<00:05:20.590> if<00:05:20.830> you

definitely try it out if you have the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.150 
definitely try it out if you have the
money<00:05:33.490> like<00:05:34.320> personally<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.350> wouldn't<00:05:35.830> spend

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160

money like personally I wouldn't spend
$32<00:05:37.090> on<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.480> because<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:37.870> probably<00:05:38.200> wouldn't

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
$32 on this because I probably wouldn't

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.090 
$32 on this because I probably wouldn't
wear<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:38.950> everyday

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
wear it everyday

wear it everyday
like<00:05:42.100> this<00:05:42.220> would<00:05:42.370> be<00:05:42.460> really<00:05:42.880> pretty<00:05:43.060> for

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
would definitely splurge like if I was

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.600 
would definitely splurge like if I was
to<00:05:48.669> my<00:05:48.760> wedding<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.419> would<00:05:49.960> justify<00:05:50.380> paying<00:05:50.770> $32

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
to my wedding I would justify paying $32

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.230 
to my wedding I would justify paying $32
it's<00:05:52.600> kind<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:52.930> building<00:05:53.140> up<00:05:53.470> now<00:05:53.880> maybe<00:05:54.880> it

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
it's kind of building up now maybe it

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.400 
it's kind of building up now maybe it
could<00:05:55.419> also<00:05:55.600> be<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.810> color<00:05:56.050> because<00:05:56.290> the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
could also be the color because the

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.590 
could also be the color because the
color<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:56.680> like<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.010> flashy<00:05:57.250> color<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.850> was<00:05:58.390> just

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
color is like a flashy color I was just

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.260 
color is like a flashy color I was just
thinking<00:05:58.990> it<00:05:59.110> would<00:05:59.200> be<00:05:59.229> more<00:05:59.530> gold<00:05:59.800> but<00:06:00.460> with

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
thinking it would be more gold but with

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.270 
thinking it would be more gold but with
water<00:06:01.570> I<00:06:01.690> think<00:06:01.870> you<00:06:02.169> can<00:06:02.470> build<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:02.950> up<00:06:03.070> but<00:06:03.250> I

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
water I think you can build it up but I

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.980 
water I think you can build it up but I
would<00:06:03.430> definitely<00:06:03.880> recommend<00:06:04.240> going<00:06:04.720> to

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
would definitely recommend going to

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.900 
would definitely recommend going to
actually<00:06:05.350> get<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:06.190> liquid<00:06:06.580> that<00:06:06.700> it's

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
actually get the liquid that it's

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.980 
actually get the liquid that it's
supposed<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:07.210> come<00:06:07.390> with<00:06:07.419> and<00:06:07.690> I<00:06:07.750> kind<00:06:07.930> of

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
supposed to come with and I kind of

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.300 
supposed to come with and I kind of
think<00:06:08.110> it's<00:06:08.290> done<00:06:08.470> that<00:06:08.620> this<00:06:08.800> set<00:06:09.010> came<00:06:09.280> with

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
think it's done that this set came with

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.490 
think it's done that this set came with
this<00:06:09.690> but<00:06:10.690> it<00:06:10.810> didn't<00:06:10.990> come<00:06:11.080> with<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.229> liquid

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
this but it didn't come with a liquid

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.480 
this but it didn't come with a liquid
obviously<00:06:11.860> they<00:06:11.979> want<00:06:12.160> you<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:12.340> buy<00:06:12.430> the

obviously they want you to buy the
liquid<00:06:12.820> but<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.030> kind<00:06:13.300> of<00:06:13.330> think<00:06:13.450> that's<00:06:13.600> a<00:06:13.720> rib

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900
