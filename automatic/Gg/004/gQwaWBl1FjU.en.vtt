00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.052
 Bee, I want to talk to you about the university. 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.317
 I'm so excited that I can't hide it ... 

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:14.809
 I don't take you with me. 

00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:19.278
 Guarding ended? You've done your job. 

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:21.999
 Come on, don't do it. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.013
 I'm sorry, Bee. You will always be my first car. 

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:30.596
 Hi beauty, I have a webcam so we can see it. 

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.421
 Sounds great, I can't wait. 

00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:43.640
 She just jumped in the middle of an hour. 

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:45.096
 I see symbols. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.717
 There are many things we haven't told you. 

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:50.500
 This is not my war! 

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.206
 I'm afraid soon. 

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:58.427
 What you see is top secret. Don't tell my mom! 

00:00:58.653 --> 00:01:00.803
 Are any of these symbols familiar? 

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:05.183
 Archaeologists have found them on ruins around the world. 

00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:06.934
 They must mean something, a message or a map. 

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:09.374
 - Read it? - Read? No, no. 

00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.799
 We don't read much. 

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:28.833
 Megatron wants something from my head! 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.949
 Bumblebee! 

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:45.982
 Optimus! 

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:53.200
 Fate seldom tells us at the moment of our decision. 

00:02:06.124 --> 00:02:08.223
 Transformers: Revenge of the Defeated 

00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:10.404
 It looks just like a tractor. 

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:15.665
 Weird, huh?
