00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 all right 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.139
 Hello mudas, I'm Alejandro Marco, yes 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.150
 I was here with all of you in a 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.519
 video of my first biologist 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.980
 without work, be a bit confusing, 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.710
 Worry is the first time that a 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.599
 biologist and good base for the boat in 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.829
 which I'll talk about my 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.869
 first impressions on the black ops 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.309
 2 and my expectations about the game 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.619
 so doubly we all go there with 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.820
 the first companies black ops 2 is a 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.320
 game that came out the first fortnight of 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.450
 the first fortnight because many times 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.040
 we have it quite before it comes out 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.329
 has not been the case this time all 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.320
 We really wanted it to come out 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.989
 the cope 2 after a model with 3 the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.929
 really quite quite embarrassing that 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.100
 it did not get just people who competed 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.109
 certainly the people who take time 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.960
 competing they liked it at all like 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.030
 it's my case, I already picked it up 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.999
 the game in desire and in January-February already 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.280
 I was playing the game to death but 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.870
 good as many people already had 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.269
 very much wanted to leave this 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.550
 whites 2 we've caught it with 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.810
 quite a lot and it's a game that 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.360
 first versions that you have about 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.590
 especially since he knew that already brings 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.880
 has focused a lot on the image 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.619
 competitive 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.060
 with a little fear because the roll I know 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.009
 that is going to be futuristic that he was going to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.229
 change a lot but well we all know 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.090
 that Colombia is a room that in the background 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.009
 There is always the essence of Colombia 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.720
 useful and it's not going to change that subject of 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.700
 gameplay we do not think about it against is 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 a game that the first thing we've noticed 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.360
 is that it takes a lot longer to kill 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 is one of the main complaints of 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.200
 many people in my opinion is one of the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.640
 better things that you have been able to do 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.189
 They were black ops 2 edited plus several 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.500
 to kill and is that more bullets more 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.450
 skill and that if you do not try to topic my 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.280
 for the head in shooting at the points 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.990
 motocross maybe from here up 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.720
 to do more damage with weapons for 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.039
 kill before and it's an advantage to put 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.880
 you have to know much faster 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.470
 you have to do constantly 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.509
 movements so that they do not give you in 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.220
 the head of my theme of nantes and fail 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.409
 the bullets because here in black ops 2 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.030
 a bullet fails whoever is 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.110
 critically fails nothing means that you 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.329
 invade the opponent that I tell you is 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.399
 different behind where and for me 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.119
 that's a huge success then subject of 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.579
 the weapons 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.590
 in my opinion, they touch me something 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.540
 that in fact it is going to touch up the souls 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.120
 they are very very balanced all is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.280
 say the rifles kill from near by 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.630
 it costs us in the their fusion is more than 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 near 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.240
 it costs them exceptions that as I say 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.250
 you know it is retouching with the theme of 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.560
 retreat of mergers so as 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.690
 there is a very balanced game and very maps 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.480
 Simple especially have to have all 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.030
 three roads very roll with four much 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.160
 very direct action to raise them with 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.260
 strategies this new game mode 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.420
 we have had that is hard point for me 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.400
 a wonder I prefer it very much the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 demolition of ammunition even though my 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 fellow albert of good revolver thinks 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.750
 that demolition is much better than 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.120
 leave point I have played quite and what 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 that I have played tells me that the absolute 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.990
 demolition in this game usually 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 defend becomes very complicated 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.340
 maps do not all get good and spam 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.870
 absolute either for this game mode in 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.240
 thus shift away that what 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 you have to play in the last amazing that 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.390
 no, it fails absolutely nothing is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.400
 it 's really about this in corners 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.720
 waiting but good only be the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.640
 excuses and you think it's worth the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.770
 corners salts firing the corners 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.210
 it is not the longing for any excuse but 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.340
 good me and as I say I like it seems 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.380
 very frenetic and good was already seen in the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.720
 which is an amazing game mode that 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.400
 you can not stay behind so in 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.170
 my opinion has been such a success 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.720
 important to bring the community 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.160
 and as I say, these are my first 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.380
 impressions of floor 2 I find a 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.760
 very balanced game with quite 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.380
 studied and cared for in which we are going to 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.239
 have only four or five maps as 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.680
 happen as of the fractals and also in 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.390
 which we can include modes for 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.450
 vary and it's going to be just to take the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.250
 forest I am but we can add from 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.870
 hardware even demolition although good 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.489
 to me the theme of yesterday's demolition did not 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.590
 like all these things that 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.019
 I am commenting please put an opinion 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.700
 this description since it is very 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.110
 important to us that good 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.060
 to your had to have your feedback 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.709
 about getting close to the game and 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.200
 well a little bit my expectations about 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.220
 what base this game is that it is definitely going to 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.620
 mark a before and after the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.549
 competition as he did with 10 and 4 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.440
 augured 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.450
 I'm already predicting that it's going to be a game 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.340
 which will mark a before and after 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.600
 cos 2 has all the looks of that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.950
 support that puts the 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.590
 community as intuitive without doubt then 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.959
 we are going to notice a lot and good 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.609
 expectations as a player this as 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.590
 always enough to my team canon 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.560
 above everything as we did in the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.690
 Three farm doing a great role 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.190
 pity that it will touch us against v but 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.060
 well if we say pretty good now I 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.340
 I am very happy with the work 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.960
 done since good since I started 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.880
 play mostly in summer in the middle of 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.870
 summer is when more cane had played 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.400
 the group is Serbian it was shown that 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.990
 get more or less put the level 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.060
 acceptable so nothing else 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.410
 these are my impressions and extractive 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.139
 of the game because it is like any 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.639
 competitive power take it to get 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.740
 as much as possible to the maximum in the title 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.570
 yes that this all we see the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.710
 next video what macri is a lot and how 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.050
 I say leave all your opinions 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.389
 are our answers here below in 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.540
 the comments so more and up 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.540
 then
