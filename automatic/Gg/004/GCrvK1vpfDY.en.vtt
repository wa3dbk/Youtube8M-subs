00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
with how this came out I've got the I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
with how this came out I've got the I
suppose<00:01:37.380> those<00:01:37.530> high-end<00:01:37.860> wheels<00:01:38.400> they're

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
suppose those high-end wheels they're

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
suppose those high-end wheels they're
they're<00:01:39.060> chrome<00:01:39.540> wheels<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> orange

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
they're chrome wheels with the orange

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.649 
they're chrome wheels with the orange
tip<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.939> thought<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.240> because

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
tip as well and I thought that because

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.350 
tip as well and I thought that because
this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> muscle<00:01:43.470> car<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:44.490> van<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
this is a muscle car or van that this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
this is a muscle car or van that this
would<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
would be a really good one to do up it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
would be a really good one to do up it
would<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.280> lots<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.670> customization<00:01:48.630> turn

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
would have lots of customization turn

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
would have lots of customization turn
their<00:01:49.259> didn't<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.009> much<00:01:50.189> only<00:01:50.490> allowed

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
their didn't have that much only allowed

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
their didn't have that much only allowed
to<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.210> paint<00:01:51.509> job<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.229> mess<00:01:52.380> around

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to do one paint job you can mess around

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.050 
to do one paint job you can mess around
a<00:01:52.770> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.939> even

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
a little bit with this but I think even

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
a little bit with this but I think even
though<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.479> can't<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.960> much<00:01:55.200> customization

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
though you can't do much customization

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440 
though you can't do much customization
with<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.399> think<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.880> come<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.149> really

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450

with this I think is come out really
well<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> black<00:01:58.500> mixed

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
well and I think that the black mixed

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
well and I think that the black mixed
with<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.310> bright<00:01:59.700> orange<00:02:00.000> looks<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
with that bright orange looks really

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.590

good<00:02:01.250> next<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
with the classic tuna style I've got a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.349

slight<00:03:08.530> different<00:03:08.859> grill<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.609> hood<00:03:09.849> thing<00:03:10.150> I

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
slight different grill the hood thing I

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.819 
slight different grill the hood thing I
wasn't<00:03:10.660> sure<00:03:10.840> whether<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.079> go<00:03:11.319> with<00:03:11.349> this<00:03:11.650> but

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.110 
wasn't sure whether to go with this but
i<00:03:11.890> thought<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.160> know<00:03:12.220> because<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.910> doesn't

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
i thought you know because it doesn't

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.390 
i thought you know because it doesn't
have<00:03:13.269> much<00:03:13.569> customization<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.530> felt<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.160> it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
have much customization I felt like it

needed<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.910> when<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.090> found<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.510> could<00:03:16.750> do

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
needed and when I found you could do

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.659 
needed and when I found you could do
these<00:03:16.959> flames<00:03:17.319> details<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.220> side<00:03:18.459> I

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
these flames details on the side I

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.460 
these flames details on the side I
thought<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.540> have<00:03:19.690> like<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.900> red-orange

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
I suppose it's almost like an industrial

I suppose it's almost like an industrial
blue<00:03:41.139> that<00:03:41.650> looks<00:03:41.799> quite<00:03:42.069> nice<00:03:42.220> there<00:03:42.489> with

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
blue that looks quite nice there with

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.190 
blue that looks quite nice there with
the<00:03:42.790> white<00:03:43.000> but<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.480> see<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.930> see<00:03:44.079> the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the white but I see that you see the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.390 
the white but I see that you see the
wheel<00:03:44.380> was<00:03:44.530> different<00:03:44.919> on<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.099> back<00:03:45.250> in<00:03:45.370> the

wheel was different on the back in the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.220 
wheel was different on the back in the
front<00:03:45.489> as<00:03:45.819> well<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.000> don't<00:03:46.150> know<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.780> think

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
front as well I don't know I think

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.479 
front as well I don't know I think
they're<00:03:47.349> different<00:03:47.620> anyway<00:03:47.859> I'm<00:03:47.950> pretty<00:03:48.220> sure

what's this one called the déclassé
saber-tooth<00:04:00.730> muscle<00:04:01.180> car<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.690> suppose<00:04:02.379> this<00:04:02.620> is

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
saber-tooth muscle car I suppose this is

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.369 
saber-tooth muscle car I suppose this is
like<00:04:02.919> an<00:04:03.069> old<00:04:03.280> school<00:04:03.609> version<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:04.090> that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
really happy of how this one came out as

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.920 
really happy of how this one came out as
well<00:04:09.099> obviously<00:04:09.489> yellow<00:04:09.879> and<00:04:10.090> black<00:04:10.239> is<00:04:10.690> kind

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
well obviously yellow and black is kind

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.539 
well obviously yellow and black is kind
of<00:04:10.989> traditional<00:04:11.470> colors<00:04:11.799> for<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.099> car<00:04:12.400> like

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
of traditional colors for a car like

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.789 
of traditional colors for a car like
this<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.299> can<00:04:13.510> see<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.199> yellow

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
this but you can see that the yellow

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.650 
this but you can see that the yellow
comes<00:04:15.069> through<00:04:15.430> on<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.609> secondary<00:04:16.180> there<00:04:16.449> so

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
comes through on the secondary there so

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.319 
comes through on the secondary there so
the<00:04:16.840> black<00:04:17.079> actually<00:04:17.440> has<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:17.949> yellow<00:04:18.329> almost

gold unlocked yet on GTA 5 cars so what
I've<00:07:08.929> done<00:07:08.959> is<00:07:09.349> I've<00:07:09.679> just<00:07:09.860> gone<00:07:09.979> with<00:07:10.039> this<00:07:10.249> I

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:10.429 
I've done is I've just gone with this I

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.040 
I've done is I've just gone with this I
think<00:07:10.610> it<00:07:10.699> was<00:07:10.759> like<00:07:10.879> a<00:07:10.939> brown<00:07:11.449> or<00:07:11.869> like<00:07:12.020> a

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
think it was like a brown or like a

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.619 
think it was like a brown or like a
golden<00:07:12.589> brown<00:07:12.949> not<00:07:13.699> the<00:07:13.849> official<00:07:14.269> gold<00:07:14.479> in

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629 
golden brown not the official gold in

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.359 
golden brown not the official gold in
the<00:07:14.749> game<00:07:14.929> but<00:07:15.080> I<00:07:15.139> think<00:07:15.439> it<00:07:15.559> can<00:07:15.889> pass<00:07:16.069> off<00:07:16.339> the

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:16.369 
the game but I think it can pass off the

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.189 
the game but I think it can pass off the
gold<00:07:16.699> pretty<00:07:17.059> well<00:07:17.269> obviously<00:07:17.719> those<00:07:17.959> you

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199

this<00:07:25.969> kind<00:07:26.179> of<00:07:26.240> thing<00:07:26.449> it's<00:07:26.809> go<00:07:26.990> for<00:07:27.199> a<00:07:27.259> black

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:27.589 
this kind of thing it's go for a black

or a white really any of the other
brighter<00:07:30.050> colors<00:07:30.439> it<00:07:30.619> tends<00:07:30.889> to<00:07:31.009> look<00:07:31.099> a<00:07:31.219> bit

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:31.399 
brighter colors it tends to look a bit

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.159 
brighter colors it tends to look a bit
much<00:07:31.610> really<00:07:31.879> a<00:07:31.969> massive<00:07:32.389> coal<00:07:32.599> really<00:07:32.959> loud

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
much really a massive coal really loud

paint<00:07:33.469> job<00:07:33.740> I<00:07:33.979> don't<00:07:34.669> have<00:07:34.759> that<00:07:34.849> really<00:07:35.149> suits

paint job I don't have that really suits
but<00:07:35.599> i<00:07:35.659> think<00:07:35.899> that<00:07:36.050> one<00:07:36.199> looks<00:07:36.409> really<00:07:36.860> cool

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:37.129 
but i think that one looks really cool

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:38.589 
but i think that one looks really cool

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:42.469 
think this but garage is better than the

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.559 
think this but garage is better than the
other<00:07:42.499> garage<00:07:43.099> I'm<00:07:43.639> actually<00:07:43.879> not<00:07:44.149> sure<00:07:44.209> the

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:44.569 
other garage I'm actually not sure the

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:46.059 
other garage I'm actually not sure the
other<00:07:44.689> carriage<00:07:45.019> does<00:07:45.199> have<00:07:45.379> some<00:07:45.559> great<00:07:45.829> cars

other carriage does have some great cars
in<00:07:46.309> but<00:07:46.669> I<00:07:46.699> think<00:07:46.939> that<00:07:46.969> I've<00:07:47.119> done<00:07:47.329> these<00:07:47.509> ones

00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:47.749 
in but I think that I've done these ones

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:49.089 
in but I think that I've done these ones
up<00:07:47.899> a<00:07:48.019> little<00:07:48.319> bit<00:07:48.439> nicer<00:07:48.649> I<00:07:48.800> think<00:07:48.829> I've

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:49.099 
up a little bit nicer I think I've

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:50.920 
up a little bit nicer I think I've
learned<00:07:49.339> a<00:07:49.490> little<00:07:49.639> bit<00:07:49.759> from<00:07:50.269> the<00:07:50.300> comments

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:50.930 
learned a little bit from the comments

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.239 
learned a little bit from the comments
and<00:07:51.019> from<00:07:51.199> looking<00:07:51.529> my<00:07:51.709> older<00:07:51.889> cars<00:07:52.099> and<00:07:52.219> I

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:52.249 
and from looking my older cars and I

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:54.009 
and from looking my older cars and I
think<00:07:52.430> these<00:07:52.579> ones<00:07:52.819> are<00:07:53.059> really<00:07:53.689> really

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:54.019
