00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.709 

as<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:49.129> we<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> PlayStation

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.359 

that<00:01:04.920> seems<00:01:05.189> about<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.150> time

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.889 

should<00:01:11.369> always<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.880> make<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
should always just make it look like you

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.200 
should always just make it look like you
read<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.740> sometimes<00:01:14.060> somebody<00:01:15.060> can

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
read it because sometimes somebody can

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
read it because sometimes somebody can
actually<00:01:15.509> tell<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.899> read<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.500> not

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
actually tell if you read it or not

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.710 
actually tell if you read it or not
but<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> scroll<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> way<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
but if you scroll all the way to the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
but if you scroll all the way to the
bottom<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.170> generally<00:01:19.590> can't<00:01:20.190> tell<00:01:25.820> your

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
bottom they generally can't tell your

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.149 
bottom they generally can't tell your
unit<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.500> isn't<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.039> an

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
unit and there isn't going to be an

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.749 
unit and there isn't going to be an
update<00:01:29.420> for<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.539> unit<00:01:31.250> it's<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.549> one

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
update for the unit it's going to be one

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
update for the unit it's going to be one
point<00:01:33.000> five<00:01:33.570> zero<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:34.080> believe<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
point five zero I believe it's the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
point five zero I believe it's the
update<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.649> which

so downloading this update is gonna be

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.319 
so downloading this update is gonna be
really<00:02:28.170> quick<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:29.010> gonna<00:02:29.220> enable<00:02:29.549> all<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
really quick it's gonna enable all the

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.810 
really quick it's gonna enable all the
features<00:02:31.109> because<00:02:31.799> right<00:02:32.130> out<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> box

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
features because right out of the box

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.300 
features because right out of the box
none<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.420> main<00:02:33.570> features<00:02:33.840> work<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.220> you

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
none of the main features work so you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.789 
none of the main features work so you
will<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.140> want<00:02:37.530> to

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.150 
will have to have this if you want to
actually<00:02:37.980> play<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.730> unit<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:40.290> blu-ray

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
actually play the unit this blu-ray

that<00:02:47.400> stuff<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.060> useless<00:02:48.480> without<00:02:49.470> this

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
that stuff is useless without this

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.259 
that stuff is useless without this
add-on<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:52.380> now<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.130> going<00:02:53.370> ahead<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:53.850> it's

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
add-on and now it's going ahead and it's

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.580 
add-on and now it's going ahead and it's
going<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.540> install<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.170> us

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.890 

let's<00:03:00.280> see<00:03:00.430> how<00:03:00.520> long<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.940> actually<00:03:01.060> takes<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
let's see how long it actually takes and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.339 
let's see how long it actually takes and
how<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.590> does<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.760> generally<00:03:04.239> must<00:03:05.170> of

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
how it does it it's generally must of

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.030 
how it does it it's generally must of
this<00:03:05.440> stuff<00:03:05.940> tinks<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.959> quick<00:03:08.319> but

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
this stuff tinks really quick but

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.970 
this stuff tinks really quick but
depends<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.050> load<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.800> system

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
depends on what the load of the system

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.030 
depends on what the load of the system
is<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:13.390> right<00:03:13.599> now<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.780> are<00:03:14.140> on<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.349> stock<00:03:14.709> car
