one<00:01:38.180> because<00:01:39.140> there's<00:01:39.440> no<00:01:39.650> frame<00:01:39.980> 0<00:01:40.400> K<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.320> we

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
one because there's no frame 0 K and we

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.900 
one because there's no frame 0 K and we
just<00:01:42.560> gonna<00:01:42.950> set<00:01:43.460> our<00:01:44.110> texture<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.900> first

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
just gonna set our texture to the first

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.280 
just gonna set our texture to the first
texture<00:01:49.910> inside<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.840> frame<00:01:51.110> array<00:01:52.060> okay

going to move to the next frame and now

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.680 
going to move to the next frame and now
we're<00:02:42.650> going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.800> create<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.330> next<00:02:44.330> frame

okay<00:02:53.290> first<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.770> all<00:02:53.890> we're<00:02:54.070> going<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.220> check

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
okay first of all we're going to check

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.190 
okay first of all we're going to check
if<00:02:56.320> our<00:02:57.040> current<00:02:57.670> frame<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.180> less<00:02:58.510> than<00:02:58.810> the

if our current frame is less than the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.000 
if our current frame is less than the
frames<00:02:59.730> dot<00:03:00.730> length<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.990> if<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.500> less<00:03:02.980> than

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010

frames dot length so if it's less than
the<00:03:03.880> last<00:03:04.090> frame<00:03:05.700> okay<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:08.410> just<00:03:08.440> gonna<00:03:09.130> add

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the last frame okay we just gonna add

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.850 
the last frame okay we just gonna add
one<00:03:11.470> more<00:03:11.710> frame<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.970> going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.240> be

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
one more frame to it so it's going to be

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.620 
one more frame to it so it's going to be

to<00:04:14.500> restart<00:04:14.680> counting<00:04:15.670> okay<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:19.590> now<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.650> just

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
to restart counting okay and now we just

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.160 
to restart counting okay and now we just
set<00:04:21.910> up<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.150> scene<00:04:24.390> game<00:04:25.390> object<00:04:25.840> create

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
set up the scene game object create

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.840 
set up the scene game object create
other<00:04:26.410> plane<00:04:27.070> we're<00:04:27.370> going<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.520> create<00:04:27.730> a

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
other plane we're going to create a

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.350 
other plane we're going to create a
plane<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.300> add<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.700> animation<00:04:30.700> okay

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
plane to add to it the animation okay

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.210 
plane to add to it the animation okay
just<00:04:31.690> make<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:31.960> 90<00:04:32.410> 90<00:04:32.980> minus<00:04:33.850> 90<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:35.220> just

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
just make it 90 90 minus 90 and just

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.200 
just make it 90 90 minus 90 and just
reset<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.820> position<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.250> can<00:04:39.400> see<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.180> now

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
reset the position so you can see it now

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.560 
reset the position so you can see it now
right<00:04:41.040> okay<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:45.090> materials<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.270> just<00:04:46.420> going

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
right okay and materials and just going

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.430 
right okay and materials and just going
to<00:04:46.660> create<00:04:48.000> material<00:04:49.000> for<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.390> I'm<00:04:49.690> just<00:04:50.260> going

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
to create material for it I'm just going

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.790 
to create material for it I'm just going
to<00:04:50.530> call<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.800> animation

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.200 

ok

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.960 

how<00:05:11.690> many<00:05:11.930> frames<00:05:12.169> per<00:05:12.470> second<00:05:12.919> just<00:05:13.280> 12<00:05:13.610> okay

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
how many frames per second just 12 okay

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.360 
how many frames per second just 12 okay
and<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.979> frames<00:05:17.650> just<00:05:18.650> we<00:05:18.860> can<00:05:18.979> I<00:05:19.009> drove<00:05:19.190> it

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
and the frames just we can I drove it

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:34.810 
and the frames just we can I drove it
