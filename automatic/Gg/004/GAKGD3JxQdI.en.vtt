line if you know Gundam I'll tell you

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.540 
line if you know Gundam I'll tell you
kind<00:00:35.199> of<00:00:35.290> what<00:00:35.530> they<00:00:35.650> relate<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:35.949> in<00:00:36.220> terms<00:00:36.370> of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
kind of what they relate to in terms of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.210 
kind of what they relate to in terms of
the<00:00:36.670> gutta<00:00:36.970> Pollock<00:00:37.809> it<00:00:37.960> name<00:00:38.140> then<00:00:39.040> if<00:00:39.160> you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
the gutta Pollock it name then if you

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.530 
the gutta Pollock it name then if you
don't<00:00:39.340> know<00:00:39.489> if<00:00:39.550> M<00:00:39.699> them<00:00:39.820> all<00:00:39.940> energy<00:00:40.270> see<00:00:40.420> it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
don't know if M them all energy see it

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.450 
don't know if M them all energy see it
so<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.140> understand<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.680> process<00:00:41.949> as<00:00:42.280> well

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
so you understand that process as well

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.850 
so you understand that process as well
this<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.449> really<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.720> model<00:00:44.140> kit<00:00:44.409> it<00:00:44.650> is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
this is really a model kit it is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.290 
this is really a model kit it is
literally<00:00:45.159> a<00:00:45.309> model<00:00:45.640> kit<00:00:45.820> like<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.150> had

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
literally a model kit like you had

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.790 
assembled back in the day of a 57 Chevy
but<00:00:48.970> it<00:00:49.089> actually<00:00:49.269> forms<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.900> figure<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.589> as

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
but it actually forms a figure so as

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.320 
but it actually forms a figure so as

actually we had found a bottom tread on
this<00:02:21.660> guy<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.440> tread<00:02:22.740> we<00:02:22.950> thought<00:02:23.160> was

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
this guy and the tread we thought was

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.730 
this guy and the tread we thought was
right<00:02:23.520> DC<00:02:24.300> Comics<00:02:24.660> approved<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:25.320> were<00:02:25.380> ok

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
right DC Comics approved it they were ok

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.860 
right DC Comics approved it they were ok
with<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.940> we<00:02:27.180> found<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.690> better

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
with it and then we found a bit better

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.630 
with it and then we found a bit better
reference<00:02:28.140> material<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.040> had<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.430> back

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
reference material so we had to go back

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.949 
reference material so we had to go back
and<00:02:29.670> correct<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.300> foot<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.660> make<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
and correct the foot to make it

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.020

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
this here to show how that works with

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.590 
this here to show how that works with
the<00:02:47.920> screw<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.430> then<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.700> build-out<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.510> if

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
the screw and then the build-out so if

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.790 
the screw and then the build-out so if
you<00:02:49.690> look<00:02:49.810> at<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.990> screw<00:02:50.260> piece<00:02:50.440> it's<00:02:50.650> got

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
you look at the screw piece it's got

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.440 
you look at the screw piece it's got
four<00:02:51.040> different<00:02:51.310> colors<00:02:51.430> we're<00:02:52.060> able<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.330> go
