right here so we're going to go up here

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.290 
right here so we're going to go up here
and<00:00:39.880> this<00:00:40.880> is<00:00:41.060> a<00:00:41.090> close-up<00:00:42.580> esta<00:00:43.580> carport<00:00:44.120> will

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
and this is a close-up esta carport will

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.080 
and this is a close-up esta carport will
we'll<00:00:44.780> put<00:00:45.020> some<00:00:45.260> solar<00:00:45.640> electric<00:00:46.640> panels

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
we'll put some solar electric panels

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.620 
we'll put some solar electric panels
here<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:49.010> they<00:00:49.160> can<00:00:49.220> catch<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.760> sunlight<00:00:50.030> over

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
here so they can catch the sunlight over

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.130 
here so they can catch the sunlight over
the<00:00:50.720> carport<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:53.570> can<00:00:53.720> see<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.020> a<00:00:54.110> pretty

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140

all<00:01:30.950> right<00:01:33.040> once<00:01:34.040> again<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.520> solar<00:01:34.759> hot

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
all right once again it's a solar hot

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.680 
all right once again it's a solar hot
water<00:01:35.000> unit<00:01:35.540> right<00:01:35.659> here<00:01:35.720> we're<00:01:36.140> up<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.590> it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
water unit right here we're up on it

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.899 
water unit right here we're up on it
inches<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.840> water<00:01:40.840> through<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.470> then

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
inches of water through here and then

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.930 
inches of water through here and then
this<00:01:43.909> is<00:01:44.119> insulated<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.250> insulate<00:01:46.820> it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
this is insulated here and insulate it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.190 
this is insulated here and insulate it
right<00:01:47.149> here<00:01:47.390> too<00:01:49.479> but<00:01:50.479> as<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:50.810> can<00:01:50.930> see

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
right here too but as you can see

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.130 
right here too but as you can see
there's<00:01:52.210> room<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.360> got<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.600> clean<00:01:53.780> all<00:01:53.990> those

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
there's room you got to clean all those

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.969 
there's room you got to clean all those
leaves<00:01:54.500> off<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.289> can<00:01:57.409> see<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> sunlight

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
leaves off and you can see the sunlight

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.510 
leaves off and you can see the sunlight
from<00:01:58.430> here<00:01:58.729> as<00:01:58.850> well<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> next<00:02:00.950> project

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
from here as well so the next project

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.160 
from here as well so the next project
here<00:02:01.700> will<00:02:01.819> be<00:02:01.970> for<00:02:02.300> solar<00:02:02.750> electric

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
here will be for solar electric

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.930 
here will be for solar electric
photovoltaic<00:02:03.800> PV<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:07.220> like<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.819> can

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
photovoltaic PV and like I so you can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.740 
photovoltaic PV and like I so you can
see<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.269> cars<00:02:08.539> driving<00:02:08.959> by<00:02:10.239> nice<00:02:11.239> view<00:02:11.569> up

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
see the cars driving by nice view up

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.490 
see the cars driving by nice view up
here<00:02:13.360> then<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.420> can<00:02:14.450> put<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> dick<00:02:14.959> Mexico<00:02:15.470> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
here then you can put a dick Mexico a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.630 
here then you can put a dick Mexico a
neighbor<00:02:15.800> there<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:19.540> anyway<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:24.640> des

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
neighbor there so anyway this is a des

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.800 
neighbor there so anyway this is a des
