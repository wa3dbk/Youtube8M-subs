00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.900
 Do you know what is it? 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.740
 This vehicle has several names in Spanish 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.600
 In Spain we call it a car 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 and in Latin America in some countries they call it a car 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.060
 and in other countries they call it auto 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.060
 For its part, the action of guiding a vehicle in Spain is called driving 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.760

 And the legal document that is needed to guide a vehicle 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 it is called in Spain driving license 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.940
 and in Latin America driver's license 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 Let's now see the parts of the car according to the vocabulary we use in Spain 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.000
 The cars have two license plates, one in front and one behind 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.100
 On both sides of the license plates are the headlights, which emit the lights 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.840
 and on the four ends of the vehicle are the turn signals 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 which are used to indicate that the car is going to turn left or right 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.600
 The front glass of the car is the windshield 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.820
 and the small mirrors located on the side doors 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.720
 and inside the vehicle are called rearview mirrors 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.160
 For its part, the person driving is called the driver 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.860
 In the front of the car, under the hood 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 is the engine 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.280
 In the center are the doors 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.540
 and in the back is the trunk, the place where luggage is stored 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.020
 Also, under the car are the wheels 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.900
 that have two parts: the outside, the tire 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.440
 and the interior, the rim 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.300
 On the other hand, inside the car are the seats 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.100
 each with a seatbelt 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.000
 that in Spain it is mandatory to always wear 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.180
 The steering wheel is located in front of the driver's seat 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.840
 And in the central area there is the gear lever, which changes gear 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.360
 and the parking brake, which is used when the car is parked 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.560
 The driver handles these three elements with his hands 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.580
 while with your feet you can step on three pedals: 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.940
 on the right the accelerator, which allows to increase the speed 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.540
 in the center the brake, to reduce the speed 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.400
 and to the left the clutch, which is pressed to change gear 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.760
