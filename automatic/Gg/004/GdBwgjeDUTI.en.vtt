00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.060 
joining in with our girion to conduct
sabotage<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.899> what<00:01:55.079> we're<00:01:55.200> seeing<00:01:55.229> today<00:01:55.470> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
sabotage but what we're seeing today is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.770 
sabotage but what we're seeing today is
I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.240> Western<00:01:57.540> intelligence

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
I think the Western intelligence

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 
I think the Western intelligence
services<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.649> done<00:01:58.860> their<00:01:59.040> research<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
services have done their research and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
services have done their research and
they've<00:01:59.880> developed<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.630> new<00:02:00.810> form<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
they've developed a new form of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
they've developed a new form of
manipulating<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.610> anger<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
manipulating that anger which is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359 
manipulating that anger which is
undoubtedly<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:04.290> undoubtedly<00:02:04.710> our<00:02:05.130> young

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
undoubtedly there undoubtedly our young

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
undoubtedly there undoubtedly our young
people<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.880> seething<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.360> anger<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
people are seething with anger at the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
people are seething with anger at the
injustice<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> humanity

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
injustice and and they have the humanity

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.050 
injustice and and they have the humanity
to<00:02:09.869> identify<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.770> commonality<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to identify in commonality with the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
victims of imperialist policy sir

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.400 
victims of imperialist policy sir
that<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> region<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.930> difference

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
that the region but the difference

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.800 
that the region but the difference
between<00:02:16.530> yesteryear<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.430> today<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.330> that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
between yesteryear and today is that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.110 
between yesteryear and today is that
these<00:02:19.019> groups<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.650> facilitating<00:02:20.550> everything

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
these groups are facilitating everything

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.300 
these groups are facilitating everything
everywhere<00:02:21.959> they<00:02:22.140> go<00:02:22.170> everything<00:02:22.920> they<00:02:23.040> touch

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
everywhere they go everything they touch

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.800 
everywhere they go everything they touch
the<00:02:24.200> result<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.849> imperialism<00:02:26.849> gains<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the result is that imperialism gains and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.830 
the result is that imperialism gains and
Muslims<00:02:28.680> lose<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.660> start

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
Muslims lose so really we have to start

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.600 
Muslims lose so really we have to start
dissecting<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.160> bit<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.549> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
dissecting this and a bit more of a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.460 
dissecting this and a bit more of a
nuanced<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.090> sophisticated<00:02:33.120> manner<00:02:33.959> okay

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
nuanced and sophisticated manner okay

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.650 
nuanced and sophisticated manner okay
but<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.099> fact<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:36.150> seems<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
but the fact is that it seems that the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.210 
but the fact is that it seems that the
wooded<00:02:37.110> attackers<00:02:37.530> were<00:02:37.680> acting<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.099> their

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
wooded attackers were acting on their

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.460 
wooded attackers were acting on their
own<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:38.519> weren't<00:02:38.700> part<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.480> major<00:02:39.959> network

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
own they weren't part of a major network

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.470 
own they weren't part of a major network
it<00:02:40.680> seems<00:02:40.950> perhaps<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.580> could<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.849> case<00:02:42.269> in

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
it seems perhaps this could be a case in

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360 
it seems perhaps this could be a case in
Paris<00:02:42.780> if<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> lone<00:02:43.590> wolf<00:02:43.830> attacker<00:02:44.220> as

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Paris if it is a lone wolf attacker as

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.569 
Paris if it is a lone wolf attacker as
it<00:02:44.489> were<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.900> how<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.620> deal<00:02:47.130> with<00:02:47.400> that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
it were so how do you deal with that

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.640 
it were so how do you deal with that
when<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.599> obviously<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.989> homegrown

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
when it is obviously a homegrown
