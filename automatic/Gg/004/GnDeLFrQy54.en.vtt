00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
also known as ghee the first thing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.049 
also known as ghee the first thing
you're<00:00:57.410> going<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.620> need<00:00:57.800> is<00:00:58.039> unsalted<00:00:58.579> butter

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
you're going to need is unsalted butter

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.970

I<00:00:59.239> like<00:00:59.570> Kerrygold<00:00:59.960> because<00:01:00.350> it's<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.620> best<00:01:00.769> I

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
I like Kerrygold because it's the best I

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.090 
I like Kerrygold because it's the best I
can<00:01:01.039> find<00:01:01.730> now<00:01:02.239> salted<00:01:02.719> butter<00:01:02.929> is<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:04.070> little

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
can find now salted butter is a little

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.670 
can find now salted butter is a little
bit<00:01:04.489> harder<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:05.180> use<00:01:05.229> because<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.409> salt

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
bit harder to use because the salt

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.859 
bit harder to use because the salt
interferes<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.610> bit<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.270> making<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
interferes a bit with the making of the

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.630 
interferes a bit with the making of the
gate<00:01:09.049> first<00:01:09.829> thing<00:01:10.070> you're<00:01:10.189> going<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.369> need<00:01:10.520> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
milk fat solids will settle in the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.050 
milk fat solids will settle in the
cheesecloth<00:02:27.310> now<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.849> on<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
cheesecloth now you can see on the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.670 
cheesecloth now you can see on the
bottom<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.450> our<00:02:29.569> pot<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:30.140> have<00:02:30.319> some<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
bottom of our pot we have some of the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.350 
bottom of our pot we have some of the
white<00:02:30.860> scum<00:02:31.190> left<00:02:31.489> which<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.970> milk<00:02:32.150> fat

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
white scum left which is the milk fat

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
white scum left which is the milk fat
solids<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.260> also<00:02:33.620> when<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:33.860> look<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
solids and also when you look in the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.059 
solids and also when you look in the
cheesecloth<00:02:34.700> milk<00:02:35.150> fat<00:02:35.420> solids<00:02:35.959> are<00:02:36.200> inside

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
cheesecloth milk fat solids are inside

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.460 
cheesecloth milk fat solids are inside
the<00:02:37.220> cheesecloth<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.299> why<00:02:38.420> G<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.989> perfect

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
the cheesecloth this is why G is perfect

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.890 
the cheesecloth this is why G is perfect
for<00:02:39.920> people<00:02:40.069> who<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.610> dairy<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.239> tolerances

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
for people who have dairy and tolerances

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.619 
for people who have dairy and tolerances
because<00:02:42.440> all<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.950> milk<00:02:43.280> fat<00:02:43.549> is<00:02:43.790> removed

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
because all of that milk fat is removed

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.800 
because all of that milk fat is removed
from<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.650> butter<00:02:45.829> which<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.220> now<00:02:46.519> ghee<00:02:46.849> which

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
from the butter which is now ghee which

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.089 
from the butter which is now ghee which
is<00:02:47.930> also<00:02:48.170> why<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.560> doesn't<00:02:48.769> need<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.069> be

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
is also why it doesn't need to be

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.190 
is also why it doesn't need to be
refrigerated<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.540> see<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.019> milk

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
refrigerated we can see that the milk

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.369 
refrigerated we can see that the milk
fat<00:02:51.440> solids<00:02:51.950> are<00:02:52.190> now<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.900> cheesecloth

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
fat solids are now in the cheesecloth

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.670 
fat solids are now in the cheesecloth
and<00:02:54.920> we<00:02:55.099> can<00:02:55.340> feed<00:02:55.760> these<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.150> dog<00:02:56.510> or<00:02:56.959> just

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
and we can feed these to a dog or just

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.900 
and we can feed these to a dog or just
throw<00:02:58.160> them<00:02:58.370> away

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
throw them away

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.240 
throw them away
now<00:02:59.750> we'll<00:02:59.930> remove<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.379> cheesecloth<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:01.099> can

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
now we'll remove the cheesecloth you can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.300 
now we'll remove the cheesecloth you can
