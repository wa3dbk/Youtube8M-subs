00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello we're all here pedro and we're 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.639
 you know based on well of having us 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.400
 seen on youtube today we have to talk to you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.019
 a little call of duty black ops 3 the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.129
 museum the opportunity to try it so much 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.500
 he like me especially the multiplayer 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.730
 but we have also attended a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.470
 presentation of what is the mode 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 campaign that this year comes loaded with 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.830
 news as well as that we are 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.589
 accustomed to getting into a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 campaign alone to these six or 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.009
 seven hours to stop watching a lot of 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.939
 explosions and with a pretty plot 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.910
 intense 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.730
 this time star that surprises us with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 the cooperative campaign for four 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.420
 players we have attended the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.890
 presentation of the same although 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.640
 we can not prove it, yes we have 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 seen how good that extra year that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.940
 have had development has been 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 quite important when it comes to expanding 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.990
 what are the scenarios are 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.580
 just as linear but good at least 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.410
 now you can see that there is more 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.450
 margin I do not know if the exploration but 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.680
 follow the strategy is to say clear there 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.720
 that increase the size so that four 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.170
 Team players can continue 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.170
 going forward 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.720
 is what is call of duty at the level of 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.880
 campaign at the story level we have seen 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.210
 explosions but incredible we have seen 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.190
 as on earth it was shaking but thank you 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 to the technology that we have 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.990
 you have to remember that if you reach warfare 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.330
 already put the war in a moment 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.850
 quite advanced the three goes a little 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 further and there is good and demonstrates 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.810
 made in the to change is spectacular 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 afterwards I was able to try the best one 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.759
 true that good that I loved has 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.399
 been an hour of very frenetic very 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.229
 fun and there are the odd novelty 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.340
 quite interesting that to lovers 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.070
 of call of duty you will like and what 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 good that pedro that is expert also in 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.460
 call of duty you could say is going to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.930
 count now 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.930
 Well, I'll tell you 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.789
 to see I'm not an expert but yes 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.979
 I'm a big fan of what has played 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.109
 everyone and I've had the luck to try the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.640
 multiplayer as well says manu these 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.090
 gameplays that you are going to see that you are going to see 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.789
 above are thanks to black the one 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.830
 carries the optical channel esp and os what 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.200
 I say that because you could bring a 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 capturing we had not been told anything 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.379
 we have realized late and he has given us 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.879
 kindly these games so that 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.400
 see a little bit how the game moves 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.080
 direct is to say as it came out of the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.040
 capturing then when a little 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.850
 feelings that you had with the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.510
 multiplayer 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.430
 if advanced warfighter had already been 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.370
 approached pretty much what is so folk 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.550
 the concept of vertical combat black 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.590
 ops 3 powers it by adding chasing 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.720
 through the walls a novelty that has 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.240
 liked it a lot because it adds a 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.830
 very fast displacement especially 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.480
 when they kill you and you have a response 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.430
 immediate and you want to get a bit to the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.800
 area where they have killed that the best is 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.900
 flag does and have you responded to etna by 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.730
 example also the slide the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.410
 Sliding has been improved to be 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.780
 much more dynamic is very easy 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.700
 move and slide and it makes sense 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.340
 use it at the time of shooting or at the time 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.830
 to dodge something that in the previous with 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.950
 what was good for you but it was more 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.440
 aesthetic that practical and news about 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.500
 all at the class level apart from that there 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.850
 more slots you can create good there's more 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.970
 we are balanced everything there is more 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.920
 options more grenades more weapons what of 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.110
 always expected a call of duty have 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.440
 added something that I liked a lot and 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.330
 is that there are specialist classes where 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.670
 the protagonists of those classes are not 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.800
 the generic soldier called 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.870
 gunner 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.690
 the other is nobody will perish but they are 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.270
 characters with name with personality and 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.850
 with voice with history something that come back 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.860
 you want it is not something so new 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.640
 in a saga that is usually marine 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.380
 random that hits shots as to the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.330
 pure gameplay has a novelty 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.220
 interesting and is that every time 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.450
 I've been talking to Manu, not us 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.950
 we have agreed neither have we 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.750
 asked should we ask him to see 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.420
 if we can do it tomorrow every X 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.150
 time or when you kill like streak 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.700
 special you can press r1 l1 at a time 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.380
 to activate a special ability a 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.840
 ability outside of pÃ©rez of advantages 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.430
 etcetera and in my case in the games 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.070
 that I played I played a hard point a 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.120
 hot spot a capture the flag and 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.799
 a domain I used a lightning rifle 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.600
 plasma rays that most remembered of 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.700
 made to battle from that we play very 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.100
 little bit and the truth is that this 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.560
 component then adds a little more 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.210
 of madness a game that maybe at 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.980
 principle there seems to be chaos 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.290
 uncontrollable but then eventually 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.970
 I realized that it is much more 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.080
 quiet to play that the previous one with 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.870
 what useful and this 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.840
 Well, it's going to like fans a lot 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.569
 they loved the previous one but criticized 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 in that point of madness is point of no 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.030
 control or what I'm seeing in 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.849
 screen because there are too many high 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.949
 here to crash here is a great job and 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.979
 is that in these games I felt the 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.590
 bullets that hit boxes to that engine's 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.330
 impact of the bullet is very good is 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.819
 very well achieved remember to always 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.319
 mythified with the 24 the modern warfare 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.300
 and the truth is that it has come out very 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.460
 happy of these games also helps 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.229
 that it has been my turn to play against people 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.969
 that I did not have much experience in 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.210
 game has already swept easy and proven 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.129
 gusts like an air strike a bird that 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.650
 You can drive through the air and shooting in 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:21.569
 order we have a call of duty with what 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.759
 release a very polished multiplayer and 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.830
 surely we also have zombies like 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.009
 they were not the ones who invented it so 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.639
 another year with absolute vice and see 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.639
 how about the game
