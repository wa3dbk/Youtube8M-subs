00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 have my dear friends pure beauty with 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.020
 all six octaves of the course of 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 microbiology still talking about 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.990
 microscopy 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.420
 Let's talk about confocal microscopy. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.830
 room will be very fast because many 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.179
 of the concepts that we are going to use 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 Class we ended up using class 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 past then I suggest you watch 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 fluorescence microscopy for 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.910
 better understand the microscopy lesson 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 specifically at this time I 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.720
 I'll show you the general usage advice 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.179
 of confocal microscopy is how it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.759
 it's how it works show the details 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.010
 technique of working to make 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.020
 visualization of tissues and cells 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.760
 client to analyze and display 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.480
 applications of microscopy 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.489
 confocal beauty then that to start 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.010
 People have seen in previous classes. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.020
 these four types of optical microscopy 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.910
 field optical microscopy 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.649
 dark phase contrast and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 blooming each one has a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 specific property 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 We are analyzing the types 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 phones that we want 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.739
 only an important thing that people 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 have to see in these four types of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.610
 microscopy that the focus is on everyone 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.710
 the plans 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.710
 at the same time we see a single 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.189
 image and we can not world there 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.770
 the plane on which we are focusing 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.140
 our sample, that is, we always 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 will get all the structures in one 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 single plane 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.840
 we can not make plans 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 different from our shows that we 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 we are evaluating to generate an image 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.530
 three-dimensional 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.200
 and how do you know all kinds of 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.240
 they are three-dimensional bodies the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 our cells, for example, they are not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.070
 a two-dimensional plated image and yes 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.590
 three-dimensional 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.320
 so when we look at these four 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 types of microscope will always be missing 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.439
 information about the depth of the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.909
 cell or tissue that we are 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.640
 evaluating and often important 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 To get this we use the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.969
 confocal microscopy that she can 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.600
 focus on a single plan 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.509
 then we can 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.209
 to find multiple plans only one of 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.520
 each time and there focusing these various 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.560
 plans we could put together a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.200
 three-dimensional structure 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.000
 both confocal microscopy allows to see 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.010
 details of certain 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.930
 focus of the show 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.970
 if we pick up a cell for example 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.870
 analyze those four microscopes 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.010
 I said we'll have a structure 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.440
 two-dimensional 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.830
 but if we evaluate in microscopy 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.230
 confocal we can go riding these 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.000
 link with focus on different planes 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.580
 until we arrive at a structure 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.269
 three-dimensional or two-dimensional 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.650
 more detail beauty is 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.049
 one important thing is that microscopy 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.880
 confocal is an improved segment in 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.130
 fluorescence microscopy so I 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.959
 I told you that if you 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.670
 previous fluorescence microscopy 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.519
 You'll understand this class better. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.160
 because it uses the principles of 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.209
 fluorescence microscopy for 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.920
 to use confocal beauty microscopy 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.180
 then we understand how it works. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.640
 confocal microscopy will give a 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.220
 in the main components of the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.110
 confocal microscope that are Joseph 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.819
 you are basically observing is very 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.450
 similar to a microscope of 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.450
 conventional fluorescence but not 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.090
 confocal microscope we have here a 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.040
 of light beams he goes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.650
 promote an effect on usp to make 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.840
 several beams at the same time as they 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.840
 focus on different points in 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.950
 different planes of our show that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.380
 we are evaluating 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.359
 then confocal microscopy is based 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.459
 the specific focus of a plan 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.970
 with shows through the reflection of a 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.590
 laser beam that is similar to the one 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.600
 people saw there in the microscopy of 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.609
 blooming is basically there 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.459
 It's this figure she explains to us. 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.010
 super well as a microscope works 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.010
 that we have a source of 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.739
 laser that will emit a radiation 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.750
 light is that we have our 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.359
 face it has an opening that goes 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.700
 divide this beam which is 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.220
 emitted by this laser in up to three 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.380
 ok beams can be stronger and less 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.930
 people have this division of bundles here and 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.310
 there we have this diplomatic mirror is 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.799
 the mirror that we've seen 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.530
 also in the microscope class of 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.870
 blooming it will reflect the light 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.780
 which is emitted by that laser 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.490
 it reflects Veja.com 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.160
 the bundles are divided they go 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.160
 reflect different ways here in the 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.440
 our sample as they reflect from seeing 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.020
 different ways as a result here 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.540
 in the angle that it finds if this mirror 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.040
 of crohn chromate mirror it will focus 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.150
 in different points 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.090
 and then we can get an image 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.840
 three-dimensional how can we get 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.360
 your image 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.120
 he will obviously decide that he is not 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.220
 emitting a light will absorb that light 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.380
 here as we have flower goggles in our 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.840
 shows will absorb this light and will 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.090
 emit another light in another length of 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.770
 wave she will pass through these pp 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.990
 will not be repeated because it allows 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.100
 this passage and we have a detector 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.820
 which allows the focusing of only one 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.580
 plan 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.770
 if we modular mussak each plane we 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.790
 we can focus on different plans in the 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.040
 if here 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.610
 the show is conditioned only for 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.400
 focus this plan on this third plane 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.860
 here and there he goes to the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.479
 detector and then we want to have more 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.820
 details of our sample people focus on 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.700
 the next plan and so on until 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.770
 obtain a more detailed picture of the 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.690
 shows that we are evaluating and there 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.250
 if we are to see in the microscopy of 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.390
 blooming people have a certain 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.520
 amount of detail that people 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.560
 you can observe here for example in the 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.140
 tissues and microorganisms that people 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.760
 is evaluating whether we use 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.310
 confocal microscopy looks at the 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.380
 amount of detail in relation to this 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.390
 another image that we have people 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.960
 can notice a little depth 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.039
 and obviously we can see with 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.600
 more details 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.970
 the structure we see that from here 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.160
 have some depth 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.140
 Okay, how is a two-dimensional image one? 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.729
 photo we will not be able to perceive 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.890
 this in a three-dimensional way 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:18.169
 however it is possible to use techniques 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.940
 computers to be able to modulate this 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.440
 image to see a structure 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.630
 then you can 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.970
 she can look over 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.190
 down the sides that gives you a 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.300
 much more detail 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.289
 beauty and speaking of applications like me 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.780
 I talked about getting pictures 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.610
 two-dimensional cells allows a 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.940
 greater detailing of the many structures 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.940
 Sometimes we need to have 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.040
 three-dimensional image for people to know 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.830
 which way certain event is 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.510
 happening in that cell in question 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.830
 obviously it follows the same 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.170
 principles of microscopy of 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.630
 blooming people can also rate 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.640
 living or dead cells is not more 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.980
 interesting to evaluate the cells 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.650
 fixed times so we can 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.190
 have a detail of the three-dimensional 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.630
 of the jungle that people are evaluating 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.070
 beauty, that's it, that was the 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.750
 reference I used for this class 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.740
 classical reference of microbiology a 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.150
 class very quickly 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.040
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.360
 Please enjoy that little joe for 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.680
 help the life science school if 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.340
 Do you help the science school of 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.440
 life 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.750
 obviously you also help others 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.700
 people find here schools and 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.320
 life and be benefited here by the 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.300
 our classes and if you want 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.370
 participate to be apart from all 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.440

 facebook of life science school 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.990
 have a I did for private search 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.910
 mentioned may also as always 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.010
