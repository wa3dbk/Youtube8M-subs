00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.220
Spectabilis,
dear Chief of Medicine, Dean of Finances,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.220
Dean of Studies, Dean of Research,
dear Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and family,

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.779
dear fellow students, for whom we gathered
today,

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.779
on behalf of the students I'd like to give
out a hearty welcome.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.570
It was my pleasure to watch the ceremony and
the students' glee.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.479
When taking a look into the students' ranks
here in our auditorium I do not solely come

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.159
across old, already known faces, but also
across some new ones.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.380
Our goals, while separate in their details,
are the same in their essence:

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
To become a good physician one day.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:05.219
My fellow students are fully aware that there
were times when we, ourselves, weren't all
that familiar to each other. 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.170
Not long after that we started to appreciate each other.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.630
I am certainly looking forward to getting
to know each and every one of the stories,
written by our new fellow students,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.700
and I would hereby like to welcome them to our semester.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.450
There's a lot of appreciation towards our
family and friends for supporting us. 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.450
They helped us in writing the first parts of our
lives at a time when we were unable to read and write.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.569
Being a physician is famous for its altruism. 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.569
On the other hand, our families do know that it can be quite solitary at times.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.560
They spare no efforts so that WE can follow our dreams.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:04.610
Months of studying, in which social
contacts were reduced to a minimum,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.610
in which the day and night rhythm is replaced by the
rhythm „open book, closed book“. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.590
And endurance sports become marathons of studying and bursts
of speed in the night before the examination.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:30.939
As medical students we are obligated to spend nights alone on
a mattress with a book, because we want to be ready 
when the day comes when we stand besides the patient's bed.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.400
I personally thank my parents for putting an emphasis on education and my brother for a body of thought.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:47.489
Our collective gratitude on behalf of all of us students goes to you,dear parents, siblings and partners.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:55.019
We know that you stand besides us, not only in the
great moments like today, but also in the more difficult moments. 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:05.209
My fellow students will thank you 
during the course of the evening,
may it be a eulogy or just a hearty embrace.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.209
It will mean: Without you I would not be here today.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:20.409
During the course of the events in the past few weeks 
I overheard my fellow students asking,
what does this coat mean to us?

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.879
The white coat is connected to medical knowledge,
trustability, diligence and responsibility.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.879
But I'm afraid to disappoint you, you can't
just put these values on like putting on a coat. 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.210
On the contrary, it is a chance for
us to gather these values.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.280
As you can see, the coats all have an universal
size. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.280
It is quite matching to our situation.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.570
We may have to grow a bit to fit into these
coats.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:02.820
We are fully aware that this knowledge and
these values can't be gathered in the loud
moments like tonight, but in the calm moments.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:34.620
Moments in which we are studying, in which we are 
ruminating about the patients we've seen the day before.
Because we care about them. 
There may be a long road ahead of us, but by the time we're done it will be a second nature to us. You can see it in a blink of an eye, in a handshake, in a caring glance.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:43.620
Our caring also goes beyond our patients 
and also towards their relatives. 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:05:00.820
We started to realise this on the day we held a funeral service for the body donors at the end of our anatomy course.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:16.750
There I've watched our fellow students in a collective 
understanding of responsibility for creating a respectful goodbye ceremony for the present relatives.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:24.990
Although I also remarked that it was nice
to see our semester growing more closely together, as one.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:36.810
An old saying goes like this: Separate trees
can only grow as fast as the surrounding forest.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.030
A personal thank you goes out to my fellow
students for a great surrounding.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:51.270
And I'd like address my fellow students with my last words: 
My congratulations go out to you, passing your pre-medical exams. 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.270
Remember why you are here.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.600
Remember where you always wanted to go. 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.390
A chapter of life may have ended after your pre-medical exams,
but it does make room for a new chapter. 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:06:08.390
The book of your own lives are in your hands,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.910
what you're about to write from now on is fully up to you.
Thank you.
