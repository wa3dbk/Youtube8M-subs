the<00:02:10.500> fundamentals<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.340> higher<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the fundamentals the higher up you go in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.260 
the fundamentals the higher up you go in
the<00:02:12.810> food<00:02:13.020> chain<00:02:13.520> most<00:02:14.520> people<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.030> very

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the food chain most people it's very

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.230 
the food chain most people it's very
easy<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.660> lose<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.920> basics<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
easy to lose the basics and I think a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240 
easy to lose the basics and I think a
lot<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> times<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:19.050> we're<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.590> those<00:02:20.040> higher

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
lot of times when we're in those higher

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.520 
lot of times when we're in those higher
echelon<00:02:20.490> positions<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.200> forget

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
echelon positions it's like you forget

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.870 
echelon positions it's like you forget
what<00:02:22.710> it's<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.100> be<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> ground<00:02:23.640> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
what it's like to be on the ground and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.000 
what it's like to be on the ground and
so<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.810> bring<00:02:24.990> people<00:02:25.320> back<00:02:25.350> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
so I think that to bring people back and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.000 
so I think that to bring people back and
say<00:02:26.850> no<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.050> how<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.440> happening<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
say no this is how it's happening on the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.140 
say no this is how it's happening on the
ground<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.340> need<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.640> review<00:02:29.970> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
ground we need to review this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.990 
ground we need to review this
information<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> beginning<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
information so it's the beginning of the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
information so it's the beginning of the
fire<00:02:33.240> season<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.900> there<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.770> lot<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
fire season and there is a lot of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.440 
fire season and there is a lot of
information<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:35.850> there<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.300> can

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
information out there that we can

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.530 
information out there that we can
collect<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.500> give<00:02:38.250> us<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.090> baseline

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
collect that can give us the baseline

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
collect that can give us the baseline
information<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:40.470> tie<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> fire

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
information to tie it to the fire

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.030 
information to tie it to the fire
behavior<00:02:41.730> triangle<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.870> there<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.950> old

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
behavior triangle and there is the old

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.550 
behavior triangle and there is the old
saying<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.550> only<00:02:44.820> fools<00:02:45.360> predict<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.350> fire

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
saying that only fools predict a fire

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.800 
saying that only fools predict a fire
season<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:47.970> there's<00:02:48.150> some<00:02:48.330> elements

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
season but I think there's some elements

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.710 
season but I think there's some elements
there<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.380> really<00:02:49.560> help<00:02:50.510> preface<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
there that can really help preface the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.170 
there that can really help preface the
upcoming<00:02:52.200> season<00:02:52.590> whether<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
upcoming season whether it's what the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.720 
upcoming season whether it's what the
fuels<00:02:54.510> are<00:02:54.900> sitting<00:02:55.320> at<00:02:55.470> based<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.160> what<00:02:56.610> was

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
fuels are sitting at based on what was

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.490 
fuels are sitting at based on what was
the<00:02:56.880> snowpack<00:02:57.300> how<00:02:57.600> much<00:02:57.750> moisture<00:02:57.930> received

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the snowpack how much moisture received

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.250 
the snowpack how much moisture received
in<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.770> spring<00:02:59.300> maybe<00:03:00.300> how<00:03:00.570> your<00:03:00.750> fuels<00:03:01.080> were

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
in the spring maybe how your fuels were

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.510 
in the spring maybe how your fuels were
burning<00:03:01.560> when<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.770> were<00:03:01.890> doing<00:03:02.040> your<00:03:02.160> spring

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
burning when you were doing your spring

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.940 
burning when you were doing your spring
burning<00:03:02.910> program<00:03:03.560> how's<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.770> weather

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
burning program how's the weather

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.949 
burning program how's the weather
setting<00:03:05.459> up<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.880> there<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.630> certain

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
setting up is there a certain

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.460 
setting up is there a certain
geographical<00:03:07.650> area<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.250> starting<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.880> see

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
geographical area that's starting to see

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.150 
geographical area that's starting to see
fire<00:03:10.470> season<00:03:10.920> starting<00:03:11.280> earlier

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
fire season starting earlier

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.010 
fire season starting earlier
so<00:03:13.730> I've<00:03:13.880> created<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.480> baseline<00:03:14.780> of

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
so I've created a baseline of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.410 
so I've created a baseline of
information<00:03:15.130> preseason<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.610> now<00:03:16.880> I'm<00:03:17.090> out<00:03:17.240> on

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
information preseason and now I'm out on

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.040 
information preseason and now I'm out on
the<00:03:17.510> fireline

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
the fireline

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.930 
the fireline
and<00:03:18.320> I'm<00:03:18.500> walking<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:19.010> line<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.520> I'm<00:03:19.640> seeing

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
and I'm walking the line and I'm seeing

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.910 
and I'm walking the line and I'm seeing
that<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.390> fuels<00:03:20.690> are<00:03:20.930> stressed<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.710> leaves

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
that the fuels are stressed the leaves

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.740 
that the fuels are stressed the leaves
are<00:03:22.100> starting<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.430> curl<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.210> colors<00:03:23.570> are

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
are starting to curl the colors are

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.030 
are starting to curl the colors are
starting<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.080> change<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.560> looks<00:03:24.740> like<00:03:24.860> it's

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
starting to change it looks like it's

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.400 
starting to change it looks like it's
fall<00:03:25.280> but<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:25.760> July<00:03:26.030> those<00:03:26.990> are<00:03:27.140> some<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.380> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
fall but it's July those are some of the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.470 
fall but it's July those are some of the
things<00:03:27.590> I'm<00:03:27.830> putting<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.100> my<00:03:28.130> mind<00:03:28.400> or<00:03:28.580> if<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.880> do

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
things I'm putting in my mind or if I do

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.330 
things I'm putting in my mind or if I do
a<00:03:29.510> moisture<00:03:30.050> probe<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.830> look<00:03:31.010> at<00:03:31.130> some<00:03:31.310> of

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
a moisture probe and I look at some of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.190 
a moisture probe and I look at some of
the<00:03:31.460> larger<00:03:31.790> fuels<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.480> there<00:03:32.660> are<00:03:32.810> single

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
the larger fuels and there are single

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.890 
the larger fuels and there are single
digits<00:03:33.650> already<00:03:34.010> or<00:03:34.640> I'm<00:03:35.210> kicking<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.720> dirt

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
digits already or I'm kicking the dirt

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.140 
digits already or I'm kicking the dirt
and<00:03:36.170> kicking<00:03:36.530> away<00:03:36.650> rotten<00:03:37.340> logs<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:37.970> there's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
no moisture left in them you're looking

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.280 
no moisture left in them you're looking
at<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:40.850> current<00:03:41.120> fire<00:03:41.390> behavior<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.930> you

Bush<00:04:15.090> he<00:04:15.810> had<00:04:15.990> him<00:04:16.140> use<00:04:16.320> an<00:04:16.560> indirect<00:04:17.100> attack

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
Bush he had him use an indirect attack

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.260 
Bush he had him use an indirect attack
they<00:04:19.230> backed<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.220> made<00:04:20.550> the<00:04:20.580> line<00:04:21.000> with

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
they backed up and made the line with

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.460 
they backed up and made the line with
the<00:04:21.360> fuel<00:04:21.630> was<00:04:21.870> light

the fuel was light

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.220 
the fuel was light
they<00:04:23.190> threw<00:04:23.460> extra<00:04:23.940> fuel<00:04:24.210> out<00:04:24.480> of<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.690> way

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.930 

then<00:04:28.230> they<00:04:28.500> burned<00:04:28.740> out<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.010> fuel<00:04:29.460> between

then they burned out the fuel between
their<00:04:30.210> line<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.840> fire<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:32.430> burning<00:04:32.850> out

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
their line and the fire this burning out

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.180 
their line and the fire this burning out
is<00:04:33.150> another<00:04:33.360> way<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.690> remove<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.380> fuel<00:04:34.620> leg<00:04:35.040> of

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
is another way to remove the fuel leg of

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
own actions out on the fireline we can't

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.620 
own actions out on the fireline we can't
be<00:04:42.560> dependent<00:04:43.040> on<00:04:43.100> somebody<00:04:43.460> else<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:43.940> always

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
of the situation that's the art you've

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.910 
of the situation that's the art you've

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
got the hard science outside of fire

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.860 
got the hard science outside of fire
behavior<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.670> yeah<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.300> can<00:05:20.570> have<00:05:20.720> all

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
behavior that yeah you can have all

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.200 
behavior that yeah you can have all
these<00:05:20.990> models<00:05:21.230> view<00:05:21.890> out<00:05:22.040> numbers<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:23.090> it's

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
these models view out numbers and it's

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.030 
these models view out numbers and it's
black<00:05:23.420> and<00:05:23.630> white<00:05:23.690> but<00:05:24.620> until<00:05:24.920> you're

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
black and white but until you're

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.550 
black and white but until you're
actually<00:05:25.220> on<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.790> ground<00:05:26.230> walking<00:05:27.230> it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
actually on the ground walking it

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.630 
actually on the ground walking it
looking<00:05:28.430> at<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:29.590> assessing<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.740> reevaluating

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
looking at it assessing and reevaluating

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.340 
looking at it assessing and reevaluating
does<00:05:32.060> those<00:05:32.270> those<00:05:32.750> numbers<00:05:33.050> mean<00:05:33.320> anything

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
does those those numbers mean anything

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.290 
does those those numbers mean anything
that's<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.100> art<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:34.880> you<00:05:34.940> have<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.120> hard

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
that's the art so you have the hard

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.790 
that's the art so you have the hard
science<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:35.960> have<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.169> art<00:05:36.350> side<00:05:36.650> of

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
science and you have the art side of

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.820 
science and you have the art side of
fire<00:05:36.950> behavior<00:05:38.350> feedback<00:05:39.350> is<00:05:39.560> really

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
weather so many times we get so focused

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.500 
weather so many times we get so focused
on<00:06:57.590> getting<00:06:58.280> from<00:06:58.610> point<00:06:58.850> A<00:06:58.940> to<00:06:58.970> point<00:06:59.120> B<00:06:59.390> just

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
on getting from point A to point B just

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.180 
on getting from point A to point B just
putting<00:07:00.110> in<00:07:00.200> line<00:07:00.410> and<00:07:00.710> putting<00:07:00.920> our<00:07:01.010> heads

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
putting in line and putting our heads

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.180 
putting in line and putting our heads
down<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.430> digging<00:07:02.350> we<00:07:03.350> forget<00:07:03.710> to<00:07:03.830> raise<00:07:04.010> our

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190

heads and really look around and look at

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.390 
heads and really look around and look at
the<00:07:05.900> changing<00:07:06.410> conditions<00:07:06.590> and<00:07:07.130> I<00:07:07.190> think

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
the changing conditions and I think

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.890 
the changing conditions and I think
that's<00:07:07.580> really<00:07:07.880> important<00:07:08.300> that's<00:07:08.570> something

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
that's really important that's something

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.150 
that's really important that's something
that<00:07:09.020> we<00:07:09.110> really<00:07:09.260> need<00:07:09.500> to<00:07:09.530> encourage<00:07:10.040> people

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
that we really need to encourage people

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.730 
that we really need to encourage people
to<00:07:10.490> do
