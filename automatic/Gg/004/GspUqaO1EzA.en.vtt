the<00:03:41.760> goo<00:03:41.940> hyung<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.780> I'm<00:03:42.959> sure<00:03:43.139> they<00:03:43.169> will

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the goo hyung but I'm sure they will

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.949 
the goo hyung but I'm sure they will
also<00:03:43.680> fit<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.010> sanchi<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.639> other<00:03:45.450> Diane

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.190 
also fit the sanchi and other Diane
cubes<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.790> there's<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.880> logo<00:03:48.239> that's<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.750> sub<00:03:48.900> 11

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.409 
cubes and there's a logo that's a sub 11
average<00:03:49.440> logo<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:50.010> probably<00:03:50.430> will<00:03:50.849> apply<00:03:51.239> that

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
average logo I probably will apply that
