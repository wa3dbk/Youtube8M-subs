again back to you with some benchmarks I

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.600 
again back to you with some benchmarks I
finally<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.660> new<00:00:06.810> PC<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.859> tested<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
finally got a new PC and I tested the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.440 
finally got a new PC and I tested the
shit<00:00:09.000> out<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.800> and<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.639> got<00:00:11.670> some<00:00:12.240> pretty

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
shit out of it and I got some pretty

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.110 
shit out of it and I got some pretty
great<00:00:12.929> results<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.620> could<00:00:14.219> run<00:00:14.429> almost<00:00:14.670> any

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
great results I could run almost any

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.830 
great results I could run almost any
game<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.599> maximum<00:00:16.440> settings<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.480> with<00:00:18.480> vsync

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
game at maximum settings and with vsync

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320 
game at maximum settings and with vsync
off<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.920> screen<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.430> not<00:00:20.550> tearing<00:00:20.880> so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
off because my screen is not tearing so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.019 
off because my screen is not tearing so
first<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.289> my<00:00:22.830> total<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.609> game

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
first of all it was my total for a game

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.259 
first of all it was my total for a game
that<00:00:24.060> doesn't<00:00:24.600> run<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.050> most<00:00:25.980> computers<00:00:26.460> like

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that doesn't run on most computers like

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
that doesn't run on most computers like
I<00:00:27.480> trees<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:28.160> great<00:00:29.160> gameplay<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.179> FPS<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I trees get great gameplay and FPS and I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.069 
I trees get great gameplay and FPS and I
7th<00:00:32.340> lag<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.890> our<00:00:34.890> motherfucker

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
7th lag like our motherfucker

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.440 
7th lag like our motherfucker
so<00:00:37.079> while<00:00:37.500> playing<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.070> got<00:00:38.309> 30<00:00:39.000> FPS<00:00:39.270> while

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so while playing this I got 30 FPS while

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.490 
so while playing this I got 30 FPS while
recording<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.140> 50<00:00:40.860> FPS<00:00:41.430> plus<00:00:41.820> -<00:00:42.350> when<00:00:43.350> not

recording and 50 FPS plus - when not
recording<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.280> course<00:00:44.579> perhaps<00:00:45.030> always<00:00:45.450> does

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
recording of course perhaps always does

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.299

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
game and the washer running but still it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.569 
game and the washer running but still it
was<00:00:53.340> quite<00:00:53.730> good<00:00:54.800> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> long<00:00:56.160> time<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
was quite good it was a long time that I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
was quite good it was a long time that I
couldn't<00:00:56.760> play<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.120> game<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.539> max<00:00:58.260> settings

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
couldn't play this game on max settings

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.279 
couldn't play this game on max settings
so<00:00:59.070> neck<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.370> arm<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so neck was arm of three a game that

super awesome PC voodoo two CPUs and
Quad<00:01:07.920> SLI<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.790> maybe<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.510> 60<00:01:09.869> FPS

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
Quad SLI then maybe you don't get 60 FPS

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
Quad SLI then maybe you don't get 60 FPS
at<00:01:10.229> max<00:01:10.409> settings<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.549> while<00:01:12.060> recording

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
at max settings but here while recording

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.679 
at max settings but here while recording
I<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.840> 20<00:01:13.320> 30<00:01:13.350> FPS<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> while<00:01:15.210> i<00:01:15.299> recording<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I got 20 30 FPS and while i recording I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280 
I got 20 30 FPS and while i recording I
got<00:01:15.869> 40<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> 70<00:01:16.740> FPS<00:01:17.090> sent<00:01:18.090> FPS<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> was

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
got 40 to 70 FPS sent FPS was when I was

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.770 
got 40 to 70 FPS sent FPS was when I was
in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.650> fields<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.180> benchmark

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.960 

so<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.110> can<00:01:30.320> run<00:01:30.560> chapala<00:01:30.950> titles<00:01:31.370> but<00:01:31.550> can<00:01:31.790> it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
so it can run chapala titles but can it

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.410 
so it can run chapala titles but can it
run<00:01:32.150> minecraft<00:01:32.570> dancer<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.620> yes<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.880> runs<00:01:35.210> at

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
run minecraft dancer is yes it runs at

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.230

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
according 60 to 200 and also it has 125

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.640 
according 60 to 200 and also it has 125
miles<00:01:42.230> installed<00:01:42.880> yeah<00:01:44.140> that's<00:01:45.140> great

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
miles installed yeah that's great

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.310 
miles installed yeah that's great
so<00:01:46.190> there's<00:01:46.490> League<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.940> Legends<00:01:47.270> also<00:01:47.720> max

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
so there's League of Legends also max

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.830 
so there's League of Legends also max
settings<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:49.460> sing<00:01:49.670> cough<00:01:51.040> runs<00:01:52.040> very<00:01:52.700> well

this<00:02:13.940> game<00:02:14.150> also<00:02:14.330> went<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.320> full<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:15.740> graphics

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this game also went for full on graphics

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.810 
this game also went for full on graphics
with<00:02:16.550> physics<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.230> had<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.530> turn<00:02:18.650> on

screen sharing so while recording I got
60<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.680> 90<00:02:24.980> FPS<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.580> while<00:02:25.790> not<00:02:26.030> according<00:02:26.510> are

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
60 to 90 FPS and while not according are

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.760 
60 to 90 FPS and while not according are
60<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.020> 120<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:29.270> game<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.600> very<00:02:30.020> GPU<00:02:30.530> bounce

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
60 to 120 this game is very GPU bounce

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.420 
60 to 120 this game is very GPU bounce
so<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:33.380> can<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:33.650> easily<00:02:33.800> recorded

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
so it's it can be easily recorded

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:46.470 
so it's it can be easily recorded
because<00:02:34.700> recording<00:02:35.360> takes<00:02:35.540> more<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> CPU

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.280 

next<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.930> new<00:02:48.050> thief<00:02:48.520> all<00:02:49.520> settings<00:02:50.060> are

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
next is the new thief all settings are

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.750 
next is the new thief all settings are
maximum<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.830> always

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
maximum as always

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.089 
maximum as always
and<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.390> would<00:02:54.720> run<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.440> lot<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.830> pieces

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
and it would run on a lot of pieces

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.770 
and it would run on a lot of pieces
because<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.489> game<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.150> very<00:02:57.599> well

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
because this game is just with very well

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
because this game is just with very well
optimized<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.530> let's<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.310> get<00:03:02.550> through

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
optimized and let's just get through

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.140 
optimized and let's just get through
these<00:03:03.650> benchmarks

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.450 

so<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.570> not<00:03:09.690> according<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.200> game<00:03:10.380> gets<00:03:10.650> 60

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
so what not according this game gets 60

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.990 
so what not according this game gets 60
to<00:03:11.550> 70<00:03:11.880> FPS<00:03:12.980> even<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.910> the
