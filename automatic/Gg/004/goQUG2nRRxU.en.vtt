below<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.369> well

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
below but I think it's going pretty well

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.350 
below but I think it's going pretty well
so<00:01:39.030> far

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
so far

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149 
so far
but<00:01:39.659> projects<00:01:39.930> 3-6-5<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> basically<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> get

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
but projects 3-6-5 is basically to get

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
from me I'm going to invent the end of a

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.860 
from me I'm going to invent the end of a
word<00:05:28.629> and<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:29.259> it<00:05:29.919> ties<00:05:30.300> even<00:05:31.300> audacity

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
word and that is it ties even audacity

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.180 
word and that is it ties even audacity
open<00:05:32.169> damn<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.500> I<00:05:32.590> invented<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:32.949> in<00:05:33.069> one<00:05:33.159> of

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
open damn it I invented this in one of

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.740 
open damn it I invented this in one of
our<00:05:33.310> further<00:05:33.520> maths<00:05:33.699> lessons<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.630> can

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
our further maths lessons and you can

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.670 
our further maths lessons and you can
put<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:34.900> on<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.080> end<00:05:35.199> of<00:05:35.259> love<00:05:35.380> words<00:05:35.560> like

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
put it on the end of love words like

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.700 
put it on the end of love words like
negative<00:05:36.099> to<00:05:36.669> negativity<00:05:37.599> is<00:05:37.900> something<00:05:38.590> if

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
negative to negativity is something if

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.749 
negative to negativity is something if
you<00:05:38.800> need<00:05:38.979> it<00:05:39.069> to<00:05:39.099> be<00:05:39.219> negative<00:05:39.370> then<00:05:39.610> you

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
you need it to be negative then you

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.580 
you need it to be negative then you
negativity<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:40.690> if<00:05:40.840> you<00:05:40.930> need<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.139> be<00:05:41.229> positive

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
negativity so if you need to be positive

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.019 
negativity so if you need to be positive
to<00:05:41.620> square<00:05:41.919> root<00:05:41.949> it<00:05:42.219> then<00:05:42.370> you<00:05:42.490> positive

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
to square root it then you positive

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.480 
to square root it then you positive
