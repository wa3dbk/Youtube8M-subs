00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 Why 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.649
 the shot is rectified 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.649
 some tests successfully that the current atom platform 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.720
 dexia is not not to break matter by subject after

 the galley my mother has brignais with marc massÃ© arrived the earthquake that has 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.739

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.180
 Platform 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.180
 besides, some do not accept men 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930
 it's a theater show 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.310
 the cause is that of the freedom of expression this character 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.540
 I did not know it was forbidden 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 in this task 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.170
 in the absence of some pass he said in particular 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.960
 it is this form 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.720
 from it's all that is extremely polluting 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 this match was within the meaning of article l 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 they are everywhere 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.420
 but what I do know is why I'm angry 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.620
 this week 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.570

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.920
 specialists in this contest 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 these famous sequences 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 christina ricci cope with an unexpected I think that's what makes 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 My strength 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.250
 chris bjr 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 this one what is not acceptable he estimated 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.180
 and what we will do is a process to its suppliers 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.680

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.539
 policies be satisfied 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.719
 that's why I took my stick and it's scary

 it might be necessary 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.219
 the successes with which 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.839
 this two-speed justice 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.939
 This thing 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.059

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.689
 with these agreements 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.259
 during this period 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.359
 currently 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.899
 this fact has led to the appearance of the first to grant funds
