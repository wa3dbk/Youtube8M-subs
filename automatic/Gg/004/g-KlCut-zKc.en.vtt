00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.569
 Welcome to the second part of Conti 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.340
 Everything started in this place 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.030
 one can assume the following are soon alright quickly created 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.559
 the optically, of course, that mayor out 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 the seventh the best of all inhabitants but if they meet that I have 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.829
 never allowed 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.289
 First of all, holidays were introduced like Valentine's Day 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.810
 So grabbing the partner does not sit on this bench 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 And even these beehives will make the atmosphere very romantic 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.519
 support 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 after that a child had to take care of the seat but not that the water is 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 the founder of the metropolis Wismar new one here one does not believe in Jesus or 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 Hamburger but at him 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.190
 in this context, the tunnel operator has deepened 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.210
 in the Holy Halls you can bid for an hour for 50 Euro per boat 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.500
 Do not do that manually will not stature at the athletes basically 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.299
 attracted attention 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.910
 until they pay the price 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 On the way back finally the town would like a portion of broccoli 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.309
 Here you can see the speech remains of it and Basta is full grown 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.680
 then a round was needed this is written 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.770
 Here, all the creative minds of the city were invited to take a look 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.710
 do 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.840
 while she is now 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 divas 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 from Campbell 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.250
 Dr 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 9 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.700
 b 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
 With 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.440
 the latest technology is incumbent 2000 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.160
 this crops the fiction crops 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.540
 to be in control of one of the stations 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.040
 because of that 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 below, the invention also has to use during the day and indeed around the pensioners legs 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 as she did not demonstrate that day 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 Rolf lives here with his wife Traudl 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.520
 Wolf made a very serious mistake 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.989
 on his wedding day, Rolf Traupe KFOR has forgotten 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.679
 they are standing in front of the stands the teams are standing 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.149
 the written Traudel tih 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.059
 and stands as Sweet as Heroes VI and with a frying pan by Traudel as 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.679
 got pulled over 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:23.109
 the effort really seeks more important topics should then taken this 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.409
 you even get that way enough 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.769
 and watch in silence 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.059
 Everyone knows big Thoma but not if they serve as chess pieces 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.049
 and the important first point 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.279
 there the second 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:41.649
 and also in the 4 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.829
 where the rest is that is unclear 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.639
 Tottenham wants a classic airship 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.909
 the outer wall succeeded in making balloons of the us state 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.099
 Here you see one creates in production 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.639
 in the deepest winter 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.119
 Here we have a public at the facility take the words here 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.119
 everybody likes to bathe seriously 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.099
 on a concrete reforms 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
 Anyone can get it 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.449
 really everyone is welcome 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.449
 but not really every artwork 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.199
 Find here annually is for their city 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.199
 the principles are as in the Colosseum 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.269
 only the question is 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.269
 the fight against the disaster 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.779
 IA 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.139
 this is the Hall of Fame 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.069
 all leaders know each other and those who have ever seen each other in the world 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.139
 are gathered here 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 over there have Eckert on the right is Frantz 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.580
 their corresponding tools 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.109
 at the back they have seen manually 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.369
 or not 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:57.839
 There are also animals in the water like these torments 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.629
 they are new here recently 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.809
 and thinks they are eating fish 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.439
 then they are wrong 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.239
 what they eat then I'll tell you so you do not leave your wallet 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.109
 unattended 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.299
 that's his clan 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.869
 the people fight against 2 1 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.439
 the piece and sets this beach 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.779
 Inadequate instigator of this sect 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.279
 what has become of them 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.449
 would be called head 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.669
 you need it but from the hustle and bustle then relax 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.669
 just on her private terrace 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.800
 Of course it can be that one wants 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.419
 to cope with 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.139
 played past him 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.139
 and give them witty comments like security 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.949
 or they go for a walk in the woods 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.689
 and just turn it off 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.240
 think about important things to think about game form there is

 they just enjoy 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.849

 Reus has made a serious mistake on the wedding day, Rolf Traupe has indeed 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.499
 grimly 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.599
