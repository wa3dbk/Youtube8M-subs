00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.940
 in ica the small and medium 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.000
 farmers and in general all the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.060
 population are having less access to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.240
 water every year that passes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.130
 what is the cause in the region ica the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 answer has to do with the increase 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 excessive exploitation of water 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.800
 underground by companies 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 agro-exporters the overexploitation of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 water mainly serves to irrigate its 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.370
 product star the asparagus is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.070
 the secret of the agro-export boom of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 asparagus is the overexploitation of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.760
 water which is causing a future 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.489
 uncertain for the region ica a study 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.780
 of cepes and progressio warns this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 alarming situation for example in ica 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.260
 they increased the cultivated hectares of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:16.710
 asparagus in 1990 there were 592 hectares 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:21.210
 in 2011 this figure grew to 12 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 thousand 782 hectares of asparagus the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.600
 production also increased from 3 thousand 750 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:35.009
 tons in 1990 to 144 thousand tons 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.950
 the year 2011 however if this continues 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.650
 trend the aquifer and kuri 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.229
 will soon decrease to levels that will be 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.259
 insufficient to continue with the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.830
 agricultural activity because companies 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 agroexporters need abundant 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.200
 volumes of water for irrigation in the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.110
 currently only one hectare of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 Asparagus receives an average of 15,000 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.009
 cubic meters of water per year and should 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.140
 reduce to 8,000 cubic meters is 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.080
 say that Peru is not only 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.319
 exporting the asparagus but also the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.769
 water that is used for irrigation there is a 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.140
 calculating concern in 2008 for 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.400
 produce all the asparagus that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.160
 exports to the USA 105 million was used 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.890
 of cubic meters of water we are 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.280
 talking about the fact that Peru exported a 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.940
 Huge amount of water equivalent 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.850
 to 42 thousand Olympic-filled swimming pools 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 to face the demand 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.080
 uncontrolled water one of the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.350
 proposals is that the ica valley 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 come back to the fruit growing we need 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.060
 better management of good luck and in 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.060
 general throughout Peru
