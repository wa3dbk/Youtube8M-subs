 test 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.270
 well let's find out which airports 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.600
 if it's a lot of people 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.889
 yes will smith and has no titirimundi that is called in many ways eeeh its 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.429
 first name 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.809
 original 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.869
 or if you commit a pure technician 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.519
 Excite that 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.970
 1794 must be given 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.169
 Each product is manufactured has a kick it is time 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.160
 and this one has quique 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.859
 thousand 393 pesos a man who eats 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.859
 Many people know him by that name 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 he knows it by the first commercial name that you 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.240
 what do you mean paraguay 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.350
 fire wire and know when rose sagueés 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.609
 they have never done me yet in 1995 they find that 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.510
 not such a new thing and a lot of people still 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.770
 he has not discovered 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.400
 It has many applications 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.750
 but it has more names if it is also called there 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.629
 of gozón and according to the manufacturer not according to the manufacturer 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.469
 clear that there is a marked that those who use it company tournament closing 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.789
 effectively as it is the best buy I do not know how I would say it to you 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.650
 white mark that interprets the psychopath that he has highlighted 4% and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.610
 more unknown 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.200
 I worked here in 1994 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.890
 Ecuador 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.960
 in this case the scale for the first time in 1995 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 on your computer etc 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310
 also paraguay 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.980
 and that name is widely used 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.760
 shortly after as nevertheless for the mind when the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.890
 audiovisual equipment 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.160
 someone is called today even with hector dv 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.950
 I mean, it has many names 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.370
 Today we are going to try to explain what it is for what is your life 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.660
 and how to identify them 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.780
 first 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.080
 We will apply for your Paraguayan workers in a connection 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.230
 of data just like the vcf something that everyone employs heroes and that is 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.220
 served 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 and has the characteristic 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.650
 in the version 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.690
 if you look at higuaín very similar to port bone 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.780
 very similar in the sense that the speed at which it is able to pass 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.030
 lobato 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.570
 the body practically the same but with a small small difference 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.460
 a very big difference 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.930
 the fairway very stable 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.359
 if this is not the state has tdt 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.109
 is copying something 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.169
 from one computer to another 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.919
 mccann hit whatever 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.919
 the speed at which it moves is not always the same 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.829
 true that no no 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.489
 it is not the same because among other things it depends on the resources of the debates 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.939
 if they do not make us 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.890
 if the memory is missing because it's the same because just five minutes to copy a 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:29.990
 file equally 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.770
 equally that 8% and from there that it is changing according to indicated a spokesman who 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.709
 also once 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.240
 that I had 17 billion seconds left 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.269
 Cuba area sources a few months ago more info 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.079
 that's why we went to the same 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.549
 It has the characteristic of other things of being able to pierce the whole 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.319
 world device to another without need 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 from a computer 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.489
 sunat and tupi 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.000
 that sounds more true is instituted as the program inter almost a point to 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.999
 point by spirit wants that this case means that it can happen 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.129
 device to another without that for half a year with 3 528 device a cable 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.979
 good external 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.979
 with which country we have a difference of many others 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.309
 of one's own with this 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.329
 so there is no need 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.409
 the also local images but nonetheless it part of the image and that 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.669
 we can put support for you to see 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.499
 a cable 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.840
 optize 1794 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.299
 for that purpose 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.069
 it will not be a detail 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.979
 this cable 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.779
 we do not care about the other end 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.819
 the human side 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.169
 something similar happens with a severe fall of vinuesa 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.399
 in this case 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.539
 it is the same one-piece cable 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:42.910
 i a tiny tintoretto connector 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.199
 the collector to be shorter but the ap team 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.659
 and the little guy 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.049
 and the manufacturers do 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.299
 cables that has 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.939
 the two ends type a 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.939
 the two groups of kobe others not here extremes 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.889
 means that this can be placed before anything the referent when 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.389
 what you see 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.010
 the annually had a device that I have on may it have its own 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.519
 connector 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.720
 same a mobile phone yes problem 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.160
 if you leave the mobile phone cable at home 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.329
 regarding the problem of energy so 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.560
 in the rabbithole the fire in that area said it clarifies 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 this is the small three large and there is no intermediate version 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.210
 and all this could ask 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.099
 and because there is a decent home peking 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.400
 kenan evren for size issue 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.580
 size yes 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.479
 because this type of connector without three but bue is usually used the equipment 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.819
 portable 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.490
 be it a computer 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.479
 has a video camera on this subject 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.809
 which is required a mini dv video camera 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.650
 that is to say that it looks 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.130
 keep in mind that it will probably take feue
