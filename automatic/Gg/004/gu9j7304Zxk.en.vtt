installing a modern diaphragm clutch
which<00:00:25.810> will<00:00:25.990> give<00:00:26.170> it<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.289> little<00:00:26.380> bit<00:00:26.500> more

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
which will give it a little bit more

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.169 
which will give it a little bit more
pressure<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.130> be<00:00:27.369> a<00:00:27.400> lot<00:00:27.490> more<00:00:27.670> reliable

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
pressure and be a lot more reliable

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.200 
pressure and be a lot more reliable
we're<00:00:28.990> going<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.199> show<00:00:29.320> you<00:00:29.349> how<00:00:29.470> this<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.710> done

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
we're going to show you how this is done

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.910 
we're going to show you how this is done
first<00:00:31.210> of<00:00:31.359> all<00:00:31.480> we<00:00:31.660> had<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:32.140> do<00:00:32.500> a<00:00:32.529> little<00:00:32.710> bit

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
first of all we had to do a little bit

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.330 
first of all we had to do a little bit
of<00:00:33.010> math<00:00:33.190> here<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:34.050> get<00:00:35.050> our<00:00:35.200> location<00:00:35.829> points

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
of math here to get our location points

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.030 
of math here to get our location points
so<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.969> we<00:00:37.059> can<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.469> coordinates<00:00:38.890> on

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
so that we can have the coordinates on

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.250 
so that we can have the coordinates on
where<00:00:39.219> to<00:00:39.309> drill<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.570> we're<00:00:40.870> just<00:00:40.960> getting

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
where to drill and we're just getting

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.850 
where to drill and we're just getting
ready<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:42.120> finish<00:00:43.120> up<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.629> center<00:00:44.620> drilling

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
ready to finish up the center drilling

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.709 
ready to finish up the center drilling
process<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.489> we<00:00:45.610> locate<00:00:45.940> all<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.120> positions

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
process so we locate all the positions

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.970 
process so we locate all the positions
of<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.989> holes<00:00:47.170> we're<00:00:47.530> going<00:00:47.680> to<00:00:47.739> show<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:47.890> how

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
of the holes we're going to show you how

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.760 
of the holes we're going to show you how
that's<00:00:48.160> done<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:49.110> having<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:50.199> digital<00:00:50.379> readout

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
that's done to having a digital readout

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.250 
that's done to having a digital readout
match<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.570> location<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.809> coordinates

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
match the location of the coordinates

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.380 
match the location of the coordinates
much<00:00:53.500> easier<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.070> do<00:00:54.219> than<00:00:54.520> using<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.030> dials

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
much easier to do than using the dials

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.609 
much easier to do than using the dials
on<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.690> mill

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:35.539 

go<00:01:05.010> into<00:01:05.309> our<00:01:05.400> next<00:01:05.670> coordinate<00:01:06.150> now

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.319 

I'm<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.719> be<00:01:36.780> installing<00:01:37.020> three<00:01:37.619> dowels

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
I'm going to be installing three dowels

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.740 
I'm going to be installing three dowels
to<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:40.109> locate<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.149> clutch<00:01:42.149> cover<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to actually locate the clutch cover to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.590 
to actually locate the clutch cover to
the<00:01:42.929> flywheel<00:01:43.200> we've<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> spot<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.600> on

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the flywheel we've got a spot here on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.620

back here and one over here you notice I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.059 
back here and one over here you notice I
put<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.840> circle<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
put a circle around these so that I

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.669 
put a circle around these so that I
don't<00:01:50.280> forget<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:51.450> drill<00:01:52.229> those<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.649> a

I've installed my reamer and we're gonna
go<00:02:55.190> ahead<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.459> ring<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.640> holes

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.870 

we<00:03:05.380> have<00:03:05.560> all<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.860> holes<00:03:06.070> drilled<00:03:06.460> for<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
we have all the holes drilled for the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.540 
we have all the holes drilled for the
bolt<00:03:07.060> holes<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:08.500> holes<00:03:08.530> drilled<00:03:09.400> and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
bolt holes and the holes drilled and

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.940 
bolt holes and the holes drilled and
reamed<00:03:09.760> for<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.210> dowel<00:03:10.390> pins<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.800> last

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
reamed for the dowel pins so the last

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.830 
reamed for the dowel pins so the last
thing<00:03:12.100> we're<00:03:12.220> going<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> do<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.180> tap<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
thing we're going to do is to tap the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.920 
thing we're going to do is to tap the
holes<00:03:14.710> for<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.190> bolts<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.390> then<00:03:16.630> we'll<00:03:16.780> take

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
holes for the bolts and then we'll take

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.840 
holes for the bolts and then we'll take
this<00:03:17.080> over<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> 500<00:03:18.070> surface<00:03:18.460> or<00:03:18.580> emery

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
this over to a 500 surface or emery

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.920 
this over to a 500 surface or emery
surfaces<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:22.330> installed<00:03:22.750> tap<00:03:23.110> guide<00:03:23.380> on<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
surfaces have installed tap guide on the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.240 
surfaces have installed tap guide on the
mill<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:27.070> put<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.850> little<00:03:28.000> bit<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.150> oil<00:03:28.270> on<00:03:28.480> our

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
mill and put a little bit of oil on our

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.220 
mill and put a little bit of oil on our
tap<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:32.170> denim<00:03:32.500> get<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.950> centered<00:03:34.020> this<00:03:35.020> will

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
tap this denim get it centered this will

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.050 
tap this denim get it centered this will
ensure<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.530> we're<00:03:35.770> over<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.670> center<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
ensure that we're over the center of the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.850 
ensure that we're over the center of the
hole<00:03:38.100> make<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.250> much<00:03:39.400> easier<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:40.440> tap<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> nice

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
hole make it much easier to tap a nice

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:51.940 
hole make it much easier to tap a nice
straight<00:03:42.490> hole

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.240 

as<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.099> can<00:03:53.280> see<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:54.590> did<00:03:55.590> add<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.830> little<00:03:56.010> bit<00:03:56.220> of

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
as you can see I did add a little bit of

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.210 
as you can see I did add a little bit of
oil<00:04:00.110> which<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.140> all-important<00:04:01.980> when<00:04:02.099> you're

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
oil which is all-important when you're

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:16.909 
oil which is all-important when you're
cutting<00:04:02.400> threads

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.459 

we're<00:04:17.639> just<00:04:17.819> about<00:04:17.969> down<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.419> bottom<00:04:21.469> raises

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
we're just about down the bottom raises

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:30.510 
we're just about down the bottom raises
about<00:04:22.830> Lane

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.370 

I'll<00:04:31.150> just<00:04:31.360> have<00:04:31.569> to<00:04:31.720> tap<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.080> other<00:04:32.139> five

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
I'll just have to tap the other five

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.840 
I'll just have to tap the other five
holes<00:04:33.870> last<00:04:34.870> step<00:04:35.139> here<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.830> surface<00:04:36.580> find

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850

the flywheel and we've got it set up
here<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.220> machine<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:39.729> we're<00:04:39.849> going<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.030> go

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
here in the machine so we're going to go

00:04:40.090 --> 00:06:21.649 
here in the machine so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.300> get<00:04:40.389> it<00:04:40.449> started
