 Tour in the new reef base

 and start the mission on the Venus 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.169
 a case rises if you can join us 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.630
 I fix her the difficulty 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:36.670
 play easy on level 32 here 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.440
 The beginning is a brand new mosquito for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.300
 ready to fuel you in this episode 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.070

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.719
 board with the buttons for nikon of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.850
 Grenades he does not just jump sideways 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.559
 but before at the same time with the fire 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.179
 button shoots pure bullets up here 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.179
 with batteries damage your enemies 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.190
 so tempting of the choir worthy against 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.470
 similar to this oldest wolf runner 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.030
 necessarily to the mosquito ripe framerate 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.190
 the end the sniper rifle 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.820
 Black pharma owns this on 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.380
 best on 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.540
 so you can practically in continuous fire 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.460
 on the yellow marked area in the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.700
 fire the wine and the runner in a jiffy 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.960
 inflict considerable damage and break 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.670
 he then puts this together before 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.570
 Best on his orange man in the field 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 around the cape 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.520
 if you can come here against national 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.270
 you withdraw into the cave and 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.270
 recover there 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.660
 if you then the 0 41 runner beyond 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.900
 you meet the first one 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.340
 times scolas the core of the kelz it stays 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.140
 first of all with these very fleeting ones 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.060
 acquaintances fight your way through the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.340
 opponent but watch out for the mine and 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.660
 at the end in front of the laser barricade also on 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.650
 the camouflaged enemies 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.150
 It is worth it for this fight 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.130
 sniper rifle against one 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.720
 shotgun with batteries to swap 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.520
 if you just come too close 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.520
 could fry him well over 1 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.879
 the energy lock happened and in the 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.040
 next room the landed castle already 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.110
 very much in the fight of this mission it goes 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.670
 all to defeat enemies 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.650
 you can either directly from here 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.870
 Do the safe method above 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.970
 or you fell down and into the middle of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.069
 Tug of war from above, I would be armed with 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.230
 Great reach is down 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.090
 in all cases a battery shotgun 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.110
 again very helpful the consignor 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.239
 captains you can also the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.919
 button cigar shaped rocket launcher 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.919
 and thereby plow through the crowd 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.500
 Little is have cleaned up the mix 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.090
 over and we can to petra 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.370

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.900
