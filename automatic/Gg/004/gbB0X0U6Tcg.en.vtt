00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.799
 good morning dear subscribers and 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:09.050
 new visitors today I would like 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.450
 present you with a very special accessory 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.830
 what is he talking about this 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.499
 sonic usb memory but that has 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.449
 particular this usb memory that I have in 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:23.210
 my hands with a capacity of 16 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.929
 gigabytes as it is a memory with 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.509
 Two types of standard 2.0 USB connections 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.989
 to be able to use it with a computer 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.960
 with a computer with windows or with 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.750
 operating system mac os x and then 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.180
 we could also use this memory 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.730
 with our smartphone with system 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.989
 operative android or with our tablet 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.410
 obviously with operating system 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.530
 Android because because this usb memory 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.600
 also has a type connection 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.800
 micro, therefore, what is this 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.120
 particularly as USB memory by sony 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 one side for example we can copy data 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.759
 in it from a pc and then 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.640
 read them on our smartphone or tablet or 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.469
 we could even copy data from 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.590
 our smartphone or tablet with the 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:21.819
 usb memory and then use this 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 usb memory to read those files 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:27.820
 documents photographs videos music in 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.030
 a computer 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.890
 a very versatile device this memory 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.650
 usb to complement the memory of 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.729
 our smartphone or tablet or to 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.820
 facilitate access to files by 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.430
 both without further delay inside video and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.000
 let's take a look at the usb memory of 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.920
 are 16 gigabytes with micro connection and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 standard usb connection 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.110
 well here we have usb memory in its 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.539
 sales container a memory of 16 GB 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.789
 and we can see that we are suggested 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.830
 downloading this application for 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.520
 our smartphone that will serve us 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.880
 to be able to read the documents of the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.590
 audio memory in the container 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.890
 sale we are told that it is compatible 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.440
 with smartphone evidently and with a PC 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.840
 and that has the usb connections 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.840
 standard and micro usb 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.790
 in the posterior zone it indicates us then 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.819
 where would be the micro connection and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.750
 gives us additional information about this 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.700
 this usb memory we are going to remove the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.700
 usb memory of the sale container and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.200
 take a closer look at this 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:01.470
 well here is the sony usb memory 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.030
 with a capacity of 16 gigabytes a 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.160
 usb memory with plastic body 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.090
 we can see obviously the usb port 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:17.010
 2.0 standard for windows pc and 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.100
 mac computers os x and we can also 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.300
 see in the body of the device this 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.090
 small this little coverage that we 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.470
 will serve to tie a ribbon 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.530
 hand or a neck strap or even 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.819
 to be able to use 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.360
 the usb memory on our keychain as 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.209
 we access the microusb connection we do 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.480
 this simple gesture we make this other 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.840
 simple gesture and here you discover the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.300
 microusb connection so typical of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.650
 devices such as smartphones or 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:01.520
 tablets this microusb connection is going to 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.890
 allow to use this memory with 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:09.010
 our smartphone or tablet 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.900
 because we do not do an access test to 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.430
 the sonny usb memory using a 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.930
 device with operating system 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.140
 Android for this I will use my 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.690
 samsung galaxy out 2 here I have my 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.880
 samsung galaxy nou 2 and what I'm going to 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:36.409
 do is insert the usb memory 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.169
 in the microusb port of the phone 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:44.169
 so what I 'm going to do is this 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:48.279
 gesture inserted the usb memory 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:52.539
 on the screen effectively on the screen 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:55.779
 directly open the usb drive so that 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:59.229
 we can copy files with total 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:03.029
 freedom so we can use this 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.790
 usb memory now it could 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:10.530
 directly search 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:13.600
 as a file on me on my phone by 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.510
 example I will go here 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.930
 I'm going to select 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.930
 I will copy several files 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.249
 and what I'm going to do is copy them to the 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:35.509
 usb memory so I'm going to indicate paste 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:38.779
 and in a moment we already have the archives 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:42.399
 of music in this case in the usb memory 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:45.699
 of sony so now simply 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.699
 I'd have to 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.860
 remove the usb memory from my device 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:58.969
 extracted safely 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.370
 go to my pc connect the usb memory by 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.500
 the standard usb port and could access 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.620
 to those files copied from my 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.050
 phone to usb memory 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.050
 and best of all, we are not going to 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.840
 need additional software to be able to 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.660
 exchange files either from 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.930
 our smartphone to memory or from 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.600
 our pc to the memory usually the 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.790
 Android devices already have a 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.479
 administrator of files that are going to be 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:34.229
 compatible with sony usb memory 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.479
 otherwise in the package or in the 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.050
 sale container we will have 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.610
 instructions to download 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.910
 free from play store a 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.970
 application compatible with this memory 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.850
 usb a product very, very, very 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.720
 recommended for any kind of 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.720
 user
