was<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.039> brake<00:00:23.240> fluid<00:00:24.240> sensor

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
was I this is a brake fluid sensor

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.380 
was I this is a brake fluid sensor
tentacles<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:27.410> this<00:00:28.410> side<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.460> and
