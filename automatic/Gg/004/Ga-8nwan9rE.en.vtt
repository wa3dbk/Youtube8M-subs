00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.720
 Hello 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.240
 If you look at my channel from day to day, you will see 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.190
 that I had to solve the head not all 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.550
 but I leave a little bit because they made me 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.860
 an examination in the hospital and they had me 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 to put a bunch of wires 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.810
 to check how my brain is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.059
 they say that the aythami tag will be notorious 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.600
 but I want to talk about children 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.460
 whiners and weepers it seems that our 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.449
 culture has already one can not say I received 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.900
 a gift of something because already those who do not 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.019
 they have that gift or their parents do not know 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.580
 have given or maybe do not have the ability 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:01:00.030
 of giving they start to cry begin to 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.229
 get angry they start insulting and they think that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.410
 one is making fun of poor people 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 let's see then if someone does not have 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.490
 something nobody else can have because that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 is the mentality and of course you can not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.259
 talk about that then if someone told me 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 ask me what kind of phone 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 you use then I have to say already 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.380
 I have a motorola of the year 1998 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.960
 because I can not tell the truth 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.300
 because now telling the truth offends 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.740
 bothers and makes children cry 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.189
 they have 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.270
 ok an example today on my facebook and 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.430
 twitter I post a very short line 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 here is the line I just direct 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.740
 I already received my iphone 5 is super cool 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.530
 that's all 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.510
 that's what is pose if I received my 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 iphone 5 because as I am with a 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:07.670
 plan with oil here in the USA every two 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.550
 years they give me a new phone 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.630
 and here is my iphone 5 even already 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.090
 I put the cover because I did not want it to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.490
 go to break if I left see if 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.030
 I'm falling but here is also a 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.390
 corner but with that I put just that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.090
 small line began to fall that I 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.100
 I could say they are trolls but man 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.670

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 and they are not trolls are people what 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.209
 we started doing things well 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.780
 stupid as there are prisoners like me 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.080

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.580
 a party there is how you fly from the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.850
 poor and incredible I can not even 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.709
 post on my personal facebook something that 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.980
 I received now how weird is that I do not 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.100
 I understand how they can be so weepy 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.800
 when they have computers are in 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.519
 facebook or are posting from some 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.760
 phone that is a smartphone 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:20.750
 and I know many children in this world 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 who do not even have to eat then what 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.100
 hypocrisy is to bother with 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.140
 someone that I have worked very hard and 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.519
 I can buy my good things and I 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.850
 I have an iphone 5 and they are not 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.130
 satisfied that they have computers that 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.880
 they have internet that you have to pay a 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.730
 quantity 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.750
 monthly money more than some 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.930
 people earn in a month 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.290
 and they complain because they do not have what 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.360
 I want to give them a secret and not 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.450
 It's a secret but it 's something my dad 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.750
 taught me my dad told me felipe the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.530
 envy is the worst thing you can 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.310
 spend your heart eating makes you feel 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.830
 the worst possible and it's not something other 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.860
 person is doing you yourself 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.730
 is complicating life and one is 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.020
 turning bitter and a person a 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.199
 super unhappy person 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.050
 if you are a person who is not happy 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.569
 when another person can get something 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.940
 good if you are a person who 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:39.310
 complaint that attacks that is filled with envy 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.180
 who thinks that just because someone 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.050
 post something positive pretty good a 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.300
 blessing a gift thinks that that's a 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.479
 personal attack for you just because no 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.030
 you get it if your heart is full of 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:00.260
 that envy and jealousy 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.930
 you will never never get the 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.210
 wishes of your heart you are never going to 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.350
 overcome in this life because the world 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.410
 look at that ugly 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.100
 your friends, even if you do not say it, look at those 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.100
 ugly and that same feeling is going to 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.860
 tie up 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.760
 and you 're just going to dream and you're never going to 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.010
 have nothing I believe a lot in doing the 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.980
 well and that good is going to make you 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.980
 but if your attitude is super bad 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:38.270
 what can we expect even if we can wait 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.850
 of your life nothing 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.350
 do not be like that, man, do not be like that, children 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.630
 according to what I have one day 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.110
 you can achieve to have many things 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.009
 I'm not a kid, I'm old 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.129
 I have what I liked 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.719
 and it will continue to cost but I wanted 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.360
 make this video to tell you one day 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:05.069
 things you are going to come but if you drive 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.069
 in the right attitude 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.400
 see you
