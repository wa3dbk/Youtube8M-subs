00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
that it just physically won't go any

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.159 
that it just physically won't go any
more<00:03:11.730> than<00:03:11.790> light<00:03:12.090> won't<00:03:12.389> go<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.930> peg

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
more than light won't go into the peg

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.059 
more than light won't go into the peg
box<00:03:13.799> because<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.849> already<00:03:15.000> reached<00:03:16.069> it's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
already reached that line there so it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.759

would would be right next to it if any
point<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.500> had<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.830> do<00:04:31.980> that<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:33.150> another

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
point you had to do that so another

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.810 
point you had to do that so another
exciting<00:04:34.410> feature<00:04:34.830> about<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.340> sticker<00:04:35.640> is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
exciting feature about this sticker is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.210 
exciting feature about this sticker is
that<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.120> actually<00:04:36.300> does<00:04:36.510> fold<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.140> half<00:04:37.470> so

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
that it actually does fold in half so

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.580 
that it actually does fold in half so
you<00:04:38.640> can<00:04:38.880> there's<00:04:39.360> like<00:04:39.570> little<00:04:39.810> perforated

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
you can there's like little perforated

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.640 
you can there's like little perforated
edge<00:04:40.830> here<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.640> can<00:04:41.790> actually<00:04:41.910> pick<00:04:42.420> off<00:04:42.660> so

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
edge here you can actually pick off so

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.500 
edge here you can actually pick off so
if<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.980> just<00:04:44.220> wanted<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.700> sort<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.000> stick<00:04:45.270> that

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
if you just wanted to sort of stick that

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.420 
if you just wanted to sort of stick that
top<00:04:45.780> half<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.380> first<00:04:46.410> finger<00:04:46.890> second

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
top half in the first finger second

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.460 
top half in the first finger second
finger<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.880> third<00:04:48.360> finger<00:04:48.420> you<00:04:49.110> could<00:04:49.260> just

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
finger and third finger you could just

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.710 
finger and third finger you could just
do<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.650> if<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.100> wanted<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.570> bit

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
do that if you wanted to the bit

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.440 
do that if you wanted to the bit
underneath<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.470> continues<00:04:53.310> on<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:53.940> is<00:04:54.210> the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
underneath it continues on this is the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.180 
underneath it continues on this is the
orange<00:04:54.750> line<00:04:54.840> here<00:04:55.260> would<00:04:55.380> be<00:04:55.560> for<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.860> fourth

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
orange line here would be for the fourth

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.450 
orange line here would be for the fourth
finger<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:57.960> could<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.650> fact<00:04:58.740> maybe<00:04:59.190> just

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
finger so you could in fact maybe just

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.340 
finger so you could in fact maybe just
cut<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.000> there<00:05:00.180> instead<00:05:00.570> if<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.750> wanted<00:05:01.170> to

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
cut it there instead if you wanted to

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.930 
cut it there instead if you wanted to
and<00:05:01.470> have<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:02.220> line<00:05:02.430> where<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.730> fourth

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
and have the line where the fourth

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.040 
and have the line where the fourth
finger<00:05:03.180> would<00:05:03.390> go<00:05:03.570> because<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.840> actually

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
finger would go because that actually

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.220 
finger would go because that actually
can<00:05:04.530> be<00:05:04.560> quite<00:05:04.650> useful<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:05.790> I<00:05:05.820> might<00:05:06.240> cut<00:05:06.990> it

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
can be quite useful so I might cut it

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.260 
can be quite useful so I might cut it
just<00:05:07.710> underneath<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.430> orange<00:05:08.970> part

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
just underneath the the orange part

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.930 
just underneath the the orange part
there<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.750> have<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.080> sort<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:11.580> up<00:05:11.730> to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
there and have it sort of have it up to

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.970 
there and have it sort of have it up to
here<00:05:12.210> that's<00:05:12.600> personally<00:05:13.320> what<00:05:13.350> what<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.710> would

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
here that's personally what what I would

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.350 
here that's personally what what I would
probably<00:05:14.160> do<00:05:14.460> if<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.670> was<00:05:14.820> going<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.000> use<00:05:15.180> that

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
probably do if I was going to use that

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.870 
probably do if I was going to use that
for<00:05:15.870> any<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.080> my<00:05:16.230> students<00:05:16.740> or<00:05:17.070> anything<00:05:17.490> and

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
for any of my students or anything and

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.750 
for any of my students or anything and
the<00:05:18.600> next<00:05:18.930> few<00:05:19.170> lines<00:05:19.440> though<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.010> purple<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
the next few lines though the purple the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.970 
the next few lines though the purple the
green<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.360> sort<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.630> brown<00:05:21.990> II<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.560> kind

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
green and the sort of brown II can kind

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.830 
green and the sort of brown II can kind
of<00:05:23.100> color<00:05:23.340> that's<00:05:23.910> for<00:05:24.210> if<00:05:24.330> you're<00:05:24.540> in<00:05:24.690> the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
of color that's for if you're in the

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.580 
of color that's for if you're in the
third<00:05:25.050> position<00:05:25.370> so<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:27.230> probably<00:05:28.230> wouldn't

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
third position so I probably wouldn't

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.410 
third position so I probably wouldn't
use<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.100> last<00:05:29.310> three<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.880> purple<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.390> green

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
use the last three the purple the green

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.080 
use the last three the purple the green
and<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.870> tan<00:05:31.140> for<00:05:31.740> third<00:05:31.950> position<00:05:32.130> just

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
and the tan for third position just

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.600 
and the tan for third position just
because<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.390> think<00:05:33.510> well<00:05:33.990> one<00:05:34.650> if<00:05:34.920> you've<00:05:35.430> got

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
because I think well one if you've got

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.130 
because I think well one if you've got
yourself<00:05:35.880> up<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.090> third<00:05:36.300> position<00:05:36.480> anyway

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
yourself up to third position anyway

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.170 
yourself up to third position anyway
you're<00:05:37.680> probably<00:05:37.890> not<00:05:38.040> going<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.220> need<00:05:38.370> the

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
you're probably not going to need the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.490 
you're probably not going to need the
rest<00:05:39.420> of<00:05:39.570> them<00:05:39.690> down<00:05:39.900> here<00:05:39.930> for<00:05:40.170> third

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
rest of them down here for third

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.860 
rest of them down here for third
position<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.100> two<00:05:41.880> if<00:05:42.150> you're<00:05:42.420> doing<00:05:42.660> third

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
position and two if you're doing third

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.480 
position and two if you're doing third
position<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:43.440> should<00:05:43.740> start<00:05:44.010> B<00:05:44.160> you<00:05:44.460> should

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
position you should start B you should

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.750 
position you should start B you should
start<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.390> use<00:05:45.570> your<00:05:45.720> own<00:05:45.900> ear<00:05:46.200> anyway<00:05:46.980> and<00:05:47.250> and

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
start to use your own ear anyway and and

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.840 
start to use your own ear anyway and and
go<00:05:48.000> more<00:05:48.240> on<00:05:48.480> sort<00:05:48.750> of<00:05:48.810> finger<00:05:49.500> gaps<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.130> close

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
go more on sort of finger gaps and close

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.160 
go more on sort of finger gaps and close
and<00:05:51.120> together<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.570> that<00:05:51.690> sort<00:05:51.900> of<00:05:51.960> thing

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
and together and that sort of thing

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.080 
and together and that sort of thing
rather<00:05:52.710> than<00:05:52.860> using<00:05:53.220> one<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.370> these<00:05:53.610> but

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
rather than using one of these but

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.600 
rather than using one of these but
definitely<00:05:54.630> definitely<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.470> think<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.490> is

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
definitely definitely I think this is

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.120 
definitely definitely I think this is
great<00:05:56.910> up<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.300> orange<00:05:57.600> line<00:05:57.870> so<00:05:58.440> most

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
great up to the orange line so most

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.550 
great up to the orange line so most
importantly<00:05:59.610> peel<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.240> sticker<00:06:00.570> off<00:06:00.600> place

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
importantly peel the sticker off place

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.010 
importantly peel the sticker off place
it<00:06:01.770> underneath<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:03.030> strings<00:06:03.390> on<00:06:03.630> top<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:03.960> the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
it underneath the strings on top of the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.140 
it underneath the strings on top of the
fingerboard<00:06:04.350> but<00:06:04.860> if<00:06:04.980> the<00:06:05.070> sticker<00:06:05.430> must<00:06:05.760> go

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
fingerboard but if the sticker must go

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.080 
fingerboard but if the sticker must go
up<00:06:06.480> 2/3<00:06:07.110> top<00:06:07.470> until<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.980> sort<00:06:08.160> of<00:06:08.190> can't<00:06:08.490> go<00:06:08.910> any

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
up 2/3 top until it sort of can't go any

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.460 
up 2/3 top until it sort of can't go any
further<00:06:09.330> that's<00:06:09.570> really<00:06:09.870> important<00:06:10.260> if<00:06:10.350> it's

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
further that's really important if it's

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.930 
further that's really important if it's
any<00:06:10.620> further<00:06:10.830> down<00:06:11.070> from<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.460> then<00:06:11.700> it<00:06:11.820> won't

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
any further down from that then it won't

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.200 
any further down from that then it won't
be<00:06:12.090> in<00:06:12.240> tune<00:06:12.540> and<00:06:13.020> then<00:06:13.200> tell<00:06:13.800> ah<00:06:13.880> you've<00:06:14.880> got

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
be in tune and then tell ah you've got

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.820 
be in tune and then tell ah you've got
your<00:06:15.690> first<00:06:16.080> thing<00:06:16.230> the<00:06:16.320> second<00:06:16.590> thing<00:06:16.740> of

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
your first thing the second thing of

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.800 
your first thing the second thing of
first<00:06:17.130> third<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.610> finger<00:06:17.880> and<00:06:18.090> fourth<00:06:18.540> finger

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
first third a finger and fourth finger

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.620 
first third a finger and fourth finger
all<00:06:18.990> done<00:06:19.200> so<00:06:19.740> I<00:06:20.040> just<00:06:20.280> think<00:06:20.730> this<00:06:20.850> is<00:06:20.910> this

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
all done so I just think this is this

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.690 
all done so I just think this is this
this<00:06:21.900> is<00:06:22.050> great<00:06:22.230> and<00:06:22.590> for<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.860> money<00:06:23.040> I<00:06:23.280> just

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
this is great and for the money I just

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.610 
this is great and for the money I just
think<00:06:23.820> it's<00:06:23.940> fantastic<00:06:24.120> I'll<00:06:24.990> put<00:06:25.230> a<00:06:25.260> link<00:06:25.470> in

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
think it's fantastic I'll put a link in

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.530 
think it's fantastic I'll put a link in
it<00:06:25.710> underneath<00:06:26.010> but<00:06:26.520> I<00:06:26.700> just<00:06:27.090> thought<00:06:27.210> I<00:06:27.390> would

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
it underneath but I just thought I would

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.780 
it underneath but I just thought I would
share<00:06:27.720> that<00:06:27.900> all<00:06:28.020> with<00:06:28.140> you<00:06:28.260> guys<00:06:28.290> and<00:06:28.830> I<00:06:29.370> hope
