popular variety in Bangladesh

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.240

and<00:01:09.110> it's<00:01:09.350> growing<00:01:09.560> on<00:01:09.680> several<00:01:09.980> million

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
and it's growing on several million

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.940 
and it's growing on several million
hectares<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.140> this<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.320> country<00:01:12.650> which<00:01:12.800> is

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
hectares and this is a country which is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.280 
hectares and this is a country which is
has<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.370> lot<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.610> flooding<00:01:13.910> problems<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.510> so<00:01:14.660> we

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
has a lot of flooding problems and so we

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.380 
has a lot of flooding problems and so we
think<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.530> would<00:01:15.620> be<00:01:15.680> very<00:01:16.090> desirable<00:01:17.090> for

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
think it would be very desirable for

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.970 
think it would be very desirable for
them<00:01:17.480> to<00:01:17.600> have<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> variety<00:01:18.050> that's<00:01:18.620> just<00:01:18.830> like

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
them to have a variety that's just like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.070 
them to have a variety that's just like
their<00:01:19.280> favorite<00:01:19.760> variety<00:01:20.150> only<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.570> torn<00:01:20.870> to
