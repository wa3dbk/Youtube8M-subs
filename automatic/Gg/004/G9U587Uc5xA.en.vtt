this<00:01:13.240> is<00:01:13.480> how<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:13.780> use<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.530> internal<00:01:14.950> mixer

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
this is how you use the internal mixer

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.340 
this is how you use the internal mixer
mode<00:01:15.580> meaning<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.360> anything<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:17.050> is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
song on the right and as you'll see the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.830 
song on the right and as you'll see the
crossfader<00:01:26.430> fades<00:01:27.430> between<00:01:27.640> them

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080 

it's<00:01:34.840> also<00:01:35.020> possible<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.829> use<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.460> connective

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
it's also possible to use the connective

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's also possible to use the connective
with<00:01:37.360> an<00:01:37.509> external<00:01:37.840> mixer<00:01:38.320> such<00:01:38.799> as<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.070> one<00:01:39.189> I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
with an external mixer such as the one I

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.280 
with an external mixer such as the one I
have<00:01:39.460> here<00:01:39.810> you're<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:40.960> need<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:41.170> be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
have here you're going to need to be

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.289 
have here you're going to need to be
able<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.470> feed<00:01:41.710> two<00:01:41.950> individual<00:01:42.670> channels<00:01:43.119> of

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
able to feed two individual channels of

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.870 
able to feed two individual channels of
signal<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.110> mixer<00:01:44.799> in<00:01:45.040> order<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.729> be<00:01:45.820> able

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
signal to this mixer in order to be able

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.929 
signal to this mixer in order to be able
to<00:01:46.030> mix<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.299> using<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.659> cross<00:01:46.869> fader<00:01:47.170> here<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
to mix it using the cross fader here so

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.779 
to mix it using the cross fader here so
simply<00:01:49.659> connect<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.500> second<00:01:51.070> output<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
simply connect the second output of the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.310 
simply connect the second output of the
connective<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.580> now<00:01:57.580> these<00:01:58.299> two<00:01:58.360> channels<00:01:59.080> or

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
connective and now these two channels or

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.830 
connective and now these two channels or
these<00:01:59.560> go<00:02:00.220> into<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.640> left<00:02:01.030> side<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.539> mixer

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
these go into the left side of the mixer

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.139 
these go into the left side of the mixer
while<00:02:02.320> these<00:02:02.500> two<00:02:02.740> channels<00:02:03.009> here<00:02:03.520> go<00:02:03.939> into

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
while these two channels here go into

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.219 
while these two channels here go into
the<00:02:04.270> right<00:02:04.479> side<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:04.990> mixer<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:07.270> torque

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the right side of the mixer in torque

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.949 
the right side of the mixer in torque
you'll<00:02:08.619> switch<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.130> mixer<00:02:09.459> mode<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:10.269> external

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
you'll switch the mixer mode to external

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.000 
you'll switch the mixer mode to external
and<00:02:11.850> now<00:02:12.850> you'll<00:02:13.060> see<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.650> playing<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.799> song

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and now you'll see that playing the song

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.750 
and now you'll see that playing the song
on<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.280> left<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:17.100> playing<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.250> song<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.640> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
line so I'm going to take the left

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.360 
line so I'm going to take the left
turntable<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.920> plug<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:05.300> input<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.780> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
turntable and plug it in to input a and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760 
turntable and plug it in to input a and
the<00:03:07.370> right<00:03:07.550> turntable<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.450> plug<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.410> to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
the right turntable and plug it in to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.910 
the right turntable and plug it in to
input<00:03:10.160> B<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.080> then<00:03:12.080> going<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.380> take<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.770> two

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
input B and then going to take the two

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.860 
input B and then going to take the two
ground<00:03:13.220> screws<00:03:14.230> or<00:03:15.230> two<00:03:15.500> grounds<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.870> screw

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
them in to the connective so they're

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.180 
them in to the connective so they're
good<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.660> go

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
good to go

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.030 
good to go
then<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.370> whole<00:03:22.610> unit<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:24.350> sit<00:03:24.590> behind<00:03:24.740> my
