00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
of rebels and and we actually strengthen

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.430 
of rebels and and we actually strengthen
this<00:03:37.400> system<00:03:37.760> now<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.239> also<00:03:38.720> made<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.410> that

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
this system now and also made it so that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.090 
this system now and also made it so that
even<00:03:40.340> if<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.610> don't<00:03:40.820> have<00:03:41.090> any<00:03:41.330> rebels<00:03:42.100> you

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
even if you don't have any rebels you

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.160 
even if you don't have any rebels you
can<00:03:43.280> actually<00:03:43.400> see<00:03:43.580> what<00:03:44.510> kind<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.810> potential

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
can actually see what kind of potential

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.630 
can actually see what kind of potential
problems<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.860> have<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.010> your<00:03:46.130> country<00:03:46.489> and

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
right with it's much more about

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.220 
right with it's much more about
decisions<00:04:49.010> than<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.490> old<00:04:49.610> III<00:04:50.000> was<00:04:50.180> we<00:04:51.050> want

example<00:04:55.940> here<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.690> can<00:04:56.870> boost<00:04:57.020> disability<00:04:57.620> of

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
example here I can boost disability of

example here I can boost disability of
my<00:04:57.800> country<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.430> will<00:04:58.580> generally<00:04:59.090> and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
my country and that will generally and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.330 
my country and that will generally and
that's<00:04:59.420> done<00:04:59.660> with<00:04:59.840> mana<00:05:00.050> points<00:05:00.380> we<00:05:00.590> maybe

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
that's done with mana points we maybe

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.940 
that's done with mana points we maybe
you<00:05:01.520> heard<00:05:01.640> about<00:05:01.760> that<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:03.560> all<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.920> sudden

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
you heard about that and all of a sudden

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.040 
you heard about that and all of a sudden
you<00:05:04.280> see<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.460> rebel<00:05:04.850> drop<00:05:05.270> suppose<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.840> had

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
you see the rebel drop suppose I had

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.860 
you see the rebel drop suppose I had
religious<00:05:06.470> rebels<00:05:06.860> right<00:05:07.690> like<00:05:08.690> for<00:05:08.840> example

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
religious rebels right like for example

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.180 
religious rebels right like for example
Venice<00:05:09.530> we<00:05:09.770> look<00:05:09.980> at<00:05:10.070> them<00:05:10.220> they<00:05:10.910> own<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
Venice we look at them they own the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.890 
Venice we look at them they own the
island<00:05:13.280> of<00:05:13.460> Crete<00:05:13.760> over<00:05:14.030> here<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:14.570> they<00:05:14.690> have

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
island of Crete over here so they have

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.260 
island of Crete over here so they have
problems<00:05:15.290> without<00:05:15.470> rebels<00:05:15.980> because<00:05:16.220> then<00:05:17.090> is

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
problems without rebels because then is

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.750 
problems without rebels because then is
a<00:05:17.510> Catholic<00:05:17.720> country<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:18.440> creates<00:05:19.220> is<00:05:19.460> an

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
a Catholic country and creates is an

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.370 
a Catholic country and creates is an
orthodox<00:05:20.210> island<00:05:20.600> so<00:05:21.050> they're<00:05:21.170> gonna<00:05:21.260> have

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
orthodox island so they're gonna have

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.370 
orthodox island so they're gonna have
religious<00:05:21.830> rebels<00:05:22.220> so<00:05:22.880> for<00:05:23.480> them<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:24.050> rebel

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
religious rebels so for them the rebel

religious rebels so for them the rebel
skin<00:05:24.560> will<00:05:24.710> look<00:05:24.740> completely<00:05:25.040> different<00:05:25.400> they

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
skin will look completely different they

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.460 
skin will look completely different they
could<00:05:26.150> send<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.450> missionary<00:05:26.870> straight<00:05:27.140> off<00:05:27.290> and

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
could send a missionary straight off and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.830 
could send a missionary straight off and
deal<00:05:27.860> with<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.130> problem<00:05:28.460> that<00:05:28.610> way<00:05:28.820> but<00:05:29.510> as<00:05:29.660> we

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
deal with the problem that way but as we

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.300 
deal with the problem that way but as we
can<00:05:29.960> see<00:05:30.020> they<00:05:30.530> failed<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:30.920> do<00:05:31.100> that<00:05:31.130> so

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
can see they failed to do that so

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.980 
can see they failed to do that so
they're<00:05:32.120> going<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.390> have<00:05:32.480> to<00:05:32.600> invade<00:05:32.810> this

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990

than<00:06:13.070> they<00:06:13.220> were<00:06:13.370> before<00:06:14.200> so<00:06:15.200> I<00:06:15.850> think<00:06:16.850> we're

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
than they were before so I think we're

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.450 
than they were before so I think we're
still<00:06:17.720> going<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:17.960> track<00:06:18.260> it's<00:06:18.650> not<00:06:18.800> alpha<00:06:19.310> yet

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
still going to track it's not alpha yet

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.760 
still going to track it's not alpha yet
but<00:06:19.730> we're<00:06:19.910> getting<00:06:19.940> there<00:06:20.230> and<00:06:21.230> then<00:06:21.410> we<00:06:21.560> have

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
but we're getting there and then we have

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.560 
but we're getting there and then we have
like<00:06:21.980> six<00:06:22.250> to<00:06:22.430> eight<00:06:22.520> months<00:06:22.550> when<00:06:23.120> we<00:06:23.210> just

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
like six to eight months when we just

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.940 
like six to eight months when we just
going<00:06:23.750> to<00:06:23.780> go<00:06:23.930> through<00:06:23.960> all<00:06:24.410> the<00:06:24.500> stuff<00:06:24.740> we're

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
going to go through all the stuff we're

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.260 
going to go through all the stuff we're
going<00:06:25.070> to<00:06:25.130> play<00:06:25.340> around<00:06:25.460> with<00:06:25.730> the<00:06:25.820> system<00:06:26.150> I

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
going to play around with the system I

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.760 
going to play around with the system I
mean<00:06:26.450> we're<00:06:26.600> already<00:06:26.720> playing<00:06:27.200> games<00:06:27.440> in<00:06:27.680> the

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
we're doing and I think it's going to be
