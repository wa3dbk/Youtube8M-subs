an Asian cube
it<00:00:32.099> sounds<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.520> initiating<00:00:33.090> cubes<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.920> seems

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it sounds like initiating cubes so seems

to work pretty well so yeah of course

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.430 
to work pretty well so yeah of course
those<00:00:37.500> layers<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:37.950> turn<00:00:38.340> oh<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.320> gonna

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
those layers don't turn oh this is gonna

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.889 
those layers don't turn oh this is gonna
be<00:00:40.530> very<00:00:41.129> interesting<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> solve<00:00:44.570> fascinating

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
be very interesting to solve fascinating

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.450 
be very interesting to solve fascinating
so<00:00:46.320> yeah<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.620> certainly<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> play

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so yeah I'm certainly gonna have to play

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
so yeah I'm certainly gonna have to play
around<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.180> alright<00:00:48.870> after<00:00:49.020> having

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
around with this alright after having

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
around with this alright after having
this<00:00:49.559> puzzle<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> few<00:00:50.399> days<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.730> must<00:00:50.910> say

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
this puzzle for a few days I must say

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.139 
this puzzle for a few days I must say
that<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.860> sure<00:00:53.699> enough<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that I do like it and sure enough it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
that I do like it and sure enough it
does<00:00:54.420> use<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:54.989> eachine<00:00:55.800> mechanism<00:00:56.430> although

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
does use the eachine mechanism although

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.060 
does use the eachine mechanism although
of<00:00:56.879> course<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.300> modified<00:00:57.629> too<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.829> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
of course it's modified too for this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
of course it's modified too for this
particular<00:00:59.399> puzzle<00:00:59.820> type<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.600> itching

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
particular puzzle type for an itching

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
particular puzzle type for an itching
mechanism<00:01:01.559> corner-cutting<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.609> you'd

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
mechanism corner-cutting is what you'd

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
mechanism corner-cutting is what you'd
expect<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> locks<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.710> bit

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
expect kind of locks up a little bit

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.500 
expect kind of locks up a little bit
it's<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.519> smooth<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.060> times<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:08.510> yeah

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's it's smooth at times and it's yeah

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's it's smooth at times and it's yeah
so<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.340> still<00:01:11.520> decently<00:01:12.000> control

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so but you can still decently control

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.210 
so but you can still decently control
the<00:01:12.630> cube<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:16.350> cube<00:01:16.590> did<00:01:16.920> come

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the cube the cube did come

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
the cube the cube did come
pre-lubricated<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> pretty<00:01:18.900> nice

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pre-lubricated which is pretty nice

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
pre-lubricated which is pretty nice
don't<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> best<00:01:20.280> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.640> lube

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
don't know if it's the best kind of lube

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.310 
don't know if it's the best kind of lube
out<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.420> i'm<00:01:21.509> sure<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> works<00:01:22.110> pretty

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
out there but i'm sure it works pretty

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
out there but i'm sure it works pretty
well<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> itching<00:01:24.119> cube

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
well and just like on the itching cube

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.679 
well and just like on the itching cube
these<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.740> center<00:01:26.130> pieces<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.880> pop<00:01:27.360> out

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
these kind of center pieces do pop out

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
these kind of center pieces do pop out
not<00:01:28.290> these<00:01:28.530> middle<00:01:28.950> ones<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> corners

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
not these middle ones just the corners

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.510 
not these middle ones just the corners
and<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.409> could<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.799> popped<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.280> on

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and so they could just be popped back on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.340 
and so they could just be popped back on
really<00:01:32.880> easily

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
really easily

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
really easily
now<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.680> solving<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
now as for solving it it's really a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.749 
now as for solving it it's really a
level<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> 3<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:36.780> 3<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:36.990> 4<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.979> with

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
level up from the 3 by 3 by 4 so with

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
level up from the 3 by 3 by 4 so with
that<00:01:38.970> knowledge<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.689> able<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> solve<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that knowledge I was able to solve it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.219 
that knowledge I was able to solve it
within<00:01:40.770> 1<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.130> 2<00:01:41.430> hours<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> very

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
within 1 or 2 hours but it was a very

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
within 1 or 2 hours but it was a very
fun<00:01:43.680> enjoyable<00:01:44.399> challenge<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.090> won't<00:01:45.630> be

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
fun enjoyable challenge I won't be

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
fun enjoyable challenge I won't be
making<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.110> tutorial<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.280> my

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
making a tutorial for this because my

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
making a tutorial for this because my
method<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.479> 3x3<00:01:48.810> before<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.500> hard

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
method for the 3x3 before was hard

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
method for the 3x3 before was hard
enough<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.340> much<00:01:50.790> less<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> 4<00:01:51.570> by<00:01:51.720> 4

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
enough as it is much less on the 4 by 4

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
enough as it is much less on the 4 by 4
by<00:01:52.079> 5<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.009> tried<00:01:53.340> teaching<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:54.180> be

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
by 5 if I tried teaching it it would be

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.260 
by 5 if I tried teaching it it would be
so<00:01:54.360> easy<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.380> lost<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.430> afraid<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so easy to get lost so I'm afraid you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.940 
so easy to get lost so I'm afraid you
won't<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.479> seeing<00:01:57.719> any<00:01:57.810> tutorials<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.680> now

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
won't be seeing any tutorials for me now

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
won't be seeing any tutorials for me now
it's<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> size<00:01:59.610> comparison<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.659> does<00:02:00.869> seem

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's for a size comparison it does seem

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's for a size comparison it does seem
to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> same<00:02:02.070> size<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.790> eachine<00:02:03.149> cube

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
to be the same size as the eachine cube

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.120 
to be the same size as the eachine cube
though<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> can't<00:02:04.229> find<00:02:04.439> mine<00:02:04.649> at<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> moment

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
though I can't find mine at the moment

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.089 
though I can't find mine at the moment
here's<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> 3x3<00:02:06.299> though<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> comparison<00:02:07.590> so

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
here's a 3x3 though for a comparison so

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.770 
here's a 3x3 though for a comparison so
they're<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> bit<00:02:08.580> tiny<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.599> still

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
they're a bit tiny but it's still

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
they're a bit tiny but it's still
controllable<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.009> disassembling

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
controllable now it's for disassembling

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.250 
controllable now it's for disassembling
it<00:02:11.849> was<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> bit<00:02:12.450> tricky

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
it was a bit tricky

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.929 
it was a bit tricky
first<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> finally<00:02:14.099> figured<00:02:14.340> out<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> if

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
first but I finally figured out that if

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.990 
first but I finally figured out that if
you<00:02:15.030> turn<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.780> longer<00:02:16.439> side<00:02:16.709> 45<00:02:17.310> degrees<00:02:17.610> then

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you turn the longer side 45 degrees then

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.149 
you turn the longer side 45 degrees then
it<00:02:18.180> simply<00:02:18.360> pops<00:02:18.810> out<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.470> along<00:02:19.860> with

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
it simply pops out like this along with

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.280 
it simply pops out like this along with
the<00:02:20.459> centerpiece<00:02:22.549> area<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.079> want<00:02:25.230> to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the centerpiece area so I don't want to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.780 
the centerpiece area so I don't want to
take<00:02:25.409> it<00:02:25.500> apart<00:02:25.590> too<00:02:26.069> much<00:02:26.340> because<00:02:26.549> it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
take it apart too much because it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.149 
take it apart too much because it's
rather<00:02:26.970> difficult<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.829> reassemble<00:02:30.980> here<00:02:31.980> so

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
rather difficult to reassemble here so

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.160 
rather difficult to reassemble here so
we've<00:02:32.310> got<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.579> basic<00:02:32.819> inner<00:02:33.390> pieces<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
we've got the basic inner pieces that

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.500 
we've got the basic inner pieces that
you<00:02:34.290> typically<00:02:34.620> see<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.010> an<00:02:35.159> Asian<00:02:35.400> cube<00:02:35.940> now

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
you typically see in an Asian cube now

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.110 
you typically see in an Asian cube now
the<00:02:36.569> pieces<00:02:37.049> do<00:02:37.290> look<00:02:37.680> quite<00:02:37.920> funny<00:02:38.430> here's<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the pieces do look quite funny here's a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360 
the pieces do look quite funny here's a
corner<00:02:39.690> one<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.140> sticks<00:02:40.470> up<00:02:40.650> all<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.190> way

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
corner one that sticks up all the way

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.640 
corner one that sticks up all the way
like<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.209> then<00:02:42.629> here's<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.140> edge<00:02:43.260> piece

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
like this and then here's the edge piece

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.670 
like this and then here's the edge piece
that<00:02:43.890> goes<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.489> below<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.319> can<00:02:46.470> see

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that goes right below it so you can see

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.289 
that goes right below it so you can see
that<00:02:46.769> there<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.430> also<00:02:47.549> make<00:02:47.849> out<00:02:48.000> some<00:02:48.209> of

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
that there you can also make out some of

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.849 
that there you can also make out some of
the<00:02:48.390> lubricant<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.319> there<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.829> well

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
the lubricant that is on there as well

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.759 
the lubricant that is on there as well
and<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:50.849> some<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.480> corner<00:02:52.139> centers

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
and here are some of the corner centers

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.129 
and here are some of the corner centers
that<00:02:53.400> can<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:54.090> split<00:02:54.329> apart<00:02:54.659> from<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.019> inner

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
that can be split apart from the inner

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.020 
that can be split apart from the inner
piece<00:02:55.349> now<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:55.889> definitely<00:02:56.370> don't<00:02:56.760> recommend

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
piece now I definitely don't recommend

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.300 
piece now I definitely don't recommend
that<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.659> you<00:02:57.750> take<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:57.989> apart<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:59.099> take

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
that if you take this apart not to take

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.460 
that if you take this apart not to take
these<00:02:59.579> because<00:03:00.030> they<00:03:00.239> have<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.659> go<00:03:00.840> they

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
these because they have to be go they

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.099 
these because they have to be go they
have<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> go<00:03:01.799> on<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.220> certain<00:03:02.670> way<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.209> it

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
have to go on in a certain way and it

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.809 
have to go on in a certain way and it
can<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.409> pretty<00:03:04.829> confusing<00:03:05.489> which

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
can just be pretty confusing which

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.879 
can just be pretty confusing which
direction<00:03:06.359> you<00:03:06.659> need<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> put<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.470> then

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
direction you need to put it on and then

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.069 
direction you need to put it on and then
here's<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.310> typical<00:03:08.609> East<00:03:09.180> Sheen<00:03:09.450> centerpiece

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
here's a typical East Sheen centerpiece

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.440 
here's a typical East Sheen centerpiece
and<00:03:10.319> then<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.829> course<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.459> inner<00:03:11.639> edge<00:03:11.940> pieces

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and then of course the inner edge pieces

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.440 
and then of course the inner edge pieces
and<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.859> inter<00:03:14.400> center<00:03:14.909> piece<00:03:15.120> now

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
and this is the inter center piece now

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.809 
and this is the inter center piece now
since<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.870> has<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.109> few<00:03:16.620> even<00:03:17.010> layered<00:03:17.430> sides

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
since this has a few even layered sides

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.309 
since this has a few even layered sides
there's<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.389> course<00:03:18.629> going<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> be<00:03:18.989> an<00:03:19.139> inner

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
there's of course going to be an inner

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.500 
there's of course going to be an inner
layer<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.859> has<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.190> stay<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.639> alignment<00:03:20.760> so

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
layer that has to stay in alignment so

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.970 
layer that has to stay in alignment so
you<00:03:21.569> can<00:03:21.750> see<00:03:21.959> here<00:03:22.199> that<00:03:22.349> it's<00:03:22.530> staying<00:03:22.769> in

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you can see here that it's staying in

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.890 
you can see here that it's staying in
there<00:03:23.160> quite<00:03:23.459> nicely<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:24.449> thing<00:03:24.660> isn't

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
there quite nicely this thing isn't

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.800 
there quite nicely this thing isn't
rotating<00:03:25.319> around<00:03:25.859> freely<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.359> rotate

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
rotating around freely but if I rotate

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.530 
rotating around freely but if I rotate
it<00:03:27.840> over<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:28.949> if<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.879> pieces

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
it over here if the pieces

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.170 
it over here if the pieces
stop<00:03:31.079> getting<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.530> er<00:03:31.709> then<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.790> piece

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
stop getting there er then this piece

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.110 
stop getting there er then this piece
you<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.660> see<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.349> locked<00:03:34.949> in<00:03:35.280> place<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.970> this

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
you can see is locked in place so this

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.990 
you can see is locked in place so this
particular<00:03:36.389> piece<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.720> what's<00:03:37.049> keeping<00:03:37.410> this

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
particular piece is what's keeping this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.430 
particular piece is what's keeping this
inner<00:03:39.000> layer<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.510> alignment<00:03:40.079> from<00:03:40.319> this

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
inner layer in alignment from this

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
piece can come up freely here there's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.229 
piece can come up freely here there's
another<00:03:46.169> piece<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.709> kind<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.250> popped<00:03:47.579> out<00:03:47.760> so

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
another piece that kind of popped out so

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.879 
another piece that kind of popped out so
the<00:03:48.329> piece<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.109> left<00:03:49.319> behind<00:03:49.709> was

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
the piece that was just left behind was

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.559 
the piece that was just left behind was
this<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.849> kind<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.120> fits<00:03:51.359> in<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
this one and it kind of fits in that

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.479 
this one and it kind of fits in that
little<00:03:52.019> slot<00:03:52.319> there<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:55.099> this<00:03:56.099> notch<00:03:56.459> that

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
little slot there and this notch that

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.960 
little slot there and this notch that
sticks<00:03:57.150> up<00:03:57.359> fits<00:03:58.290> into<00:03:58.889> this<00:03:59.040> little<00:03:59.340> hole<00:03:59.699> in

sticks up fits into this little hole in
the<00:04:00.090> center<00:04:00.299> piece<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:01.829> keeps

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
the center piece and that is what keeps

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.520 
the center piece and that is what keeps
the<00:04:02.549> inner<00:04:02.699> layer<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.389> alignment<00:04:04.109> so<00:04:04.319> now<00:04:04.470> that

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
the inner layer in alignment so now that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.069 
the inner layer in alignment so now that
it's<00:04:04.829> removed<00:04:05.220> notice<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.299> now<00:04:06.449> turn

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
it's removed notice that I can now turn

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.039 
it's removed notice that I can now turn
the<00:04:07.440> inner<00:04:07.650> layer<00:04:08.069> freely<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.329> as<00:04:09.629> a<00:04:09.659> result

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
the inner layer freely and as a result

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.089 
the inner layer freely and as a result
I'm<00:04:10.169> probably<00:04:10.319> going<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.620> lose<00:04:10.709> all<00:04:10.919> of<00:04:10.979> my

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
I'm probably going to lose all of my

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.729 
I'm probably going to lose all of my
pieces<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.449> little<00:04:12.750> notch<00:04:12.930> there<00:04:12.959> solves

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
pieces so that little notch there solves

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.319 
pieces so that little notch there solves
the<00:04:13.859> problem<00:04:14.250> now<00:04:14.430> one<00:04:14.639> last<00:04:14.849> thing<00:04:14.909> before<00:04:15.120> I

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
the problem now one last thing before I

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.550 
the problem now one last thing before I
put<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.599> back<00:04:15.810> together<00:04:15.959> as<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.409> doesn't

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
put this back together as it doesn't

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.620 
put this back together as it doesn't
look<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:16.919> there's<00:04:17.130> any<00:04:17.400> Springs<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.269> that's

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
look like there's any Springs so that's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
look like there's any Springs so that's
something<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.930> won't<00:04:19.079> be<00:04:19.260> able<00:04:19.409> to<00:04:19.470> look

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650
