a two seam fastball this is the way I
would<00:01:52.439> throw<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:54.600> seen<00:01:54.840> has<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
would throw it and the two seen has a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.649 
would throw it and the two seen has a
little<00:01:55.590> less<00:01:55.770> velocity<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:57.299> much

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
little less velocity on it that has much

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
little less velocity on it that has much
more<00:01:57.689> movement<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.920> should<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.490> but

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
more movement it should have more but

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.590 
more movement it should have more but
almost<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.149> sink

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
almost a sink

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.020 
almost a sink
singer<00:02:02.080> as<00:02:02.260> a<00:02:02.950> right-handed<00:02:03.610> pitcher<00:02:03.759> it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
singer as a right-handed pitcher it

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.179 
singer as a right-handed pitcher it
would<00:02:04.060> come<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.600> probably<00:02:05.500> go<00:02:05.619> away<00:02:05.860> from

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
would come and probably go away from

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.940 
would come and probably go away from
lefties<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.909> into<00:02:07.390> ratings<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.709> ball

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
lefties and into ratings it's a ball

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.070 
lefties and into ratings it's a ball
that<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.700> definitely<00:02:10.030> don't<00:02:10.420> want<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.840> try

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
that you definitely don't want to try

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.470 
that you definitely don't want to try
and<00:02:11.230> spot<00:02:11.500> up<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.610> definitely<00:02:12.880> want<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.270> try

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and spot up you definitely want to try

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.150 
and spot up you definitely want to try
and<00:02:13.720> throw<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.080> pretty<00:02:14.440> much<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and throw it pretty much right in the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.340 
and throw it pretty much right in the
middle<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.520> let<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.790> move<00:02:16.030> when<00:02:16.060> its<00:02:16.420> own<00:02:16.600> it

middle and let it move when its own it

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.080 
middle and let it move when its own it
otherwise<00:02:17.709> it's<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.280> waste<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.850> pitch

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.059 
scene my thumb down here and all my
pressure<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:55.840> middle<00:02:56.110> finger<00:02:56.440> basically<00:02:57.040> I

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
pressure that middle finger basically I

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.009 
pressure that middle finger basically I
couldn't<00:02:57.580> throw<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.239> my<00:02:58.600> with<00:02:58.900> my

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
couldn't throw it like this my with my

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.990 
couldn't throw it like this my with my
finger<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.709> but<00:03:00.280> obviously<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.700> will<00:03:00.790> give<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
finger up but obviously that will give a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.970 
finger up but obviously that will give a
pitch<00:03:01.269> away<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.630> don't<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.830> there's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
pitch away you don't do that so there's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.220 
pitch away you don't do that so there's
also<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.220> guy<00:03:03.459> finger<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.080> very

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
also a guy finger and this is very

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.930 
also a guy finger and this is very
important<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> changeup<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.820> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
important on a changeup and the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.330 
important on a changeup and the
curveball<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.470> be<00:03:08.620> able<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.860> come<00:03:09.070> here

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
curveball is to be able to come here

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.870 
curveball is to be able to come here
this<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:10.060> my<00:03:10.209> fastball<00:03:10.660> grip<00:03:11.019> okay<00:03:11.799> this<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:12.730> my
