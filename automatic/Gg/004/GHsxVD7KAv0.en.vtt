my desk we have the soundsticks what's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.110 
my desk we have the soundsticks what's
really<00:00:14.040> cool<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.309> them<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:14.910> they're

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
really cool about them is that they're

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.810 
really cool about them is that they're
see-through<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.160> bend<00:00:17.430> them<00:00:17.640> over

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
see-through and you can bend them over

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.420 
see-through and you can bend them over
like<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.470> there<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> an<00:00:20.250> angle

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
like this so there are more of an angle

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
like this so there are more of an angle
and<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.240> them<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.570> straight

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and you can have them up straight

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.279 
and you can have them up straight
completely<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.150> prefer<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.539> emit<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
completely I prefer that emit a little

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.009 
completely I prefer that emit a little
angle<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.960> um<00:00:29.300> these<00:00:30.300> speakers

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
angle like like that um these speakers

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.220 
angle like like that um these speakers
are<00:00:31.279> incredibly<00:00:32.279> powerful<00:00:32.850> they<00:00:33.420> crossed<00:00:33.750> one

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
are incredibly powerful they crossed one

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
are incredibly powerful they crossed one
hundred<00:00:34.559> eighty<00:00:34.710> dollars<00:00:35.190> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.460> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
hundred eighty dollars which is very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.660 
hundred eighty dollars which is very
expensive<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> end<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.950> definitely

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
expensive but at the end it's definitely

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.500 
expensive but at the end it's definitely
worth<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.090> uh<00:00:39.710> before<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.100> buy<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.510> something

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
worth it uh before you buy it something

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
worth it uh before you buy it something
