maybe<00:03:45.730> lightweight<00:03:46.269> or<00:03:46.450> something<00:03:46.810> or<00:03:46.959> it's

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
maybe lightweight or something or it's

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.379 
maybe lightweight or something or it's
able<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.439> they<00:03:48.310> said<00:03:48.519> accommodate<00:03:49.180> more

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
able to they said accommodate more

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.699 
able to they said accommodate more
gamers<00:03:49.689> so<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.139> know<00:03:50.230> I'm<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:50.469> exactly

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
gamers so I you know I'm not exactly

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.319 
gamers so I you know I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:50.889> what<00:03:51.159> that<00:03:51.189> means<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:51.579> that's<00:03:52.120> the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
sure what that means but that's the

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.909 
sure what that means but that's the
that's<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.659> Kinect<00:03:53.109> like<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.379> said<00:03:53.530> included

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
that's the Kinect like I said included

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.890 
that's the Kinect like I said included
with<00:03:54.010> all<00:03:54.159> as<00:03:54.819> well<00:03:55.030> as<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.269> controller<00:03:55.629> and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
with all as well as the controller and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.809 
with all as well as the controller and
they<00:03:55.989> mentioned<00:03:56.409> too<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.250> kinect

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
they mentioned too that the the kinect

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.699 
they mentioned too that the the kinect
sensor<00:03:58.090> will<00:03:58.450> respond<00:03:58.900> differently<00:03:59.290> if<00:03:59.590> you

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
sensor will respond differently if you

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.740 
sensor will respond differently if you
have<00:03:59.859> a<00:03:59.889> controller<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.549> your<00:04:00.669> hand<00:04:00.939> so<00:04:01.450> it'll

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
have a controller in your hand so it'll

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.659 
have a controller in your hand so it'll
be<00:04:01.840> able<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.169> identify<00:04:02.319> that<00:04:02.859> as<00:04:02.919> well<00:04:03.340> and

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
be able to identify that as well and

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.270 
be able to identify that as well and
allow<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.449> control<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.620> console

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
allow you to control the console

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.559 
allow you to control the console
differently<00:04:06.729> with<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:06.970> controller<00:04:07.269> as<00:04:07.389> well

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
differently with the controller as well

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.149 
differently with the controller as well
so<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:08.349> know<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.680> what<00:04:08.769> we<00:04:08.859> want<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.099> know

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
so I know that what we want to know

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.939 
so I know that what we want to know
about<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:10.000> hardware<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.650> actual

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
about is the hardware of the actual

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.860 
about is the hardware of the actual
console<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:12.760> I'm<00:04:13.180> going<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:13.389> go<00:04:13.479> ahead<00:04:13.510> and

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
console and so I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.610 
console and so I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:04:14.049> cut<00:04:14.590> here<00:04:14.949> to<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.579> actual<00:04:16.269> clip<00:04:16.690> where

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
just cut here to the actual clip where

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.289 
just cut here to the actual clip where
one<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.159> developers<00:04:18.549> was<00:04:18.729> talking<00:04:19.120> about

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.740 
you can actually let your xbox manage
things<00:05:23.590> like<00:05:23.889> your<00:05:24.129> cable<00:05:24.819> television<00:05:25.240> who

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
things like your cable television who

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.540 
things like your cable television who
you<00:05:25.990> subscribe<00:05:26.349> with<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:26.740> that's<00:05:27.159> interesting

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
you subscribe with so that's interesting

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.469 
you subscribe with so that's interesting
but<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.819> it<00:05:27.940> probably<00:05:28.120> explains<00:05:28.479> why

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
but that it probably explains why

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.100

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
about getting onto YouTube this is

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.589 
about getting onto YouTube this is
probably<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.520> great<00:06:00.759> time<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.090> start<00:06:01.360> you<00:06:01.509> know

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
potentially a free option through your

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.290 
potentially a free option through your
actual<00:06:08.110> console<00:06:08.590> in<00:06:09.280> able<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.759> edit<00:06:10.090> your

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
actual console in able to edit your

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.909

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
videos and get them recorded with the

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.490 
videos and get them recorded with the
onboard<00:06:12.250> DVR<00:06:12.580> so<00:06:12.819> that<00:06:13.569> seems<00:06:13.840> pretty<00:06:14.050> cool<00:06:14.259> I

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
onboard DVR so that seems pretty cool I

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
onboard DVR so that seems pretty cool I
was<00:06:15.130> excited<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.780> see<00:06:16.780> see<00:06:17.289> that<00:06:17.590> as<00:06:18.130> well<00:06:18.310> look

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
was excited to see see that as well look

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.100 
was excited to see see that as well look
at<00:06:18.580> the<00:06:18.729> exploded<00:06:19.210> view<00:06:19.360> it<00:06:19.719> doesn't<00:06:19.990> actually

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
at the exploded view it doesn't actually

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.950 
at the exploded view it doesn't actually
say<00:06:20.469> on<00:06:20.620> here<00:06:20.830> that<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:21.159> is<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.880> know<00:06:22.000> hard

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
say on here that it is you know hard

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.010 
say on here that it is you know hard
wired<00:06:23.289> LAN<00:06:24.030> capable<00:06:25.030> with<00:06:25.389> an<00:06:25.509> ethernet<00:06:25.599> cord

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
wired LAN capable with an ethernet cord

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.209 
wired LAN capable with an ethernet cord
but<00:06:26.169> you<00:06:26.259> can<00:06:26.380> see<00:06:26.529> that<00:06:26.650> there<00:06:26.770> is<00:06:26.800> a<00:06:26.889> port

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
but you can see that there is a port

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.740 
but you can see that there is a port
there<00:06:27.400> on<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.639> exploded<00:06:28.060> view<00:06:28.210> on<00:06:28.389> the<00:06:28.509> right

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
there on the exploded view on the right

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.480 
there on the exploded view on the right
so<00:06:29.080> you<00:06:29.740> don't<00:06:29.949> have<00:06:30.039> to<00:06:30.159> worry<00:06:30.310> about<00:06:30.400> that

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
so you don't have to worry about that

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.980 
so you don't have to worry about that
you<00:06:30.699> don't<00:06:30.880> have<00:06:30.969> to<00:06:31.060> use<00:06:31.240> the<00:06:31.360> wireless<00:06:31.569> if

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
you don't have to use the wireless if

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.450 
you don't have to use the wireless if
you<00:06:32.169> you<00:06:32.650> know<00:06:32.770> have<00:06:32.919> the<00:06:33.069> ability<00:06:33.430> to

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
you you know have the ability to

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.800 
you you know have the ability to
hardwire<00:06:33.969> in<00:06:34.120> your<00:06:34.210> house<00:06:34.360> and<00:06:34.569> you<00:06:34.630> think

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
hardwire in your house and you think

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.330 
hardwire in your house and you think
that's<00:06:34.930> a<00:06:35.020> little<00:06:35.050> more<00:06:35.289> stable<00:06:35.469> which<00:06:35.710> you

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
that's a little more stable which you

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.820 
that's a little more stable which you
know<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.639> tend<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:37.080> that<00:06:38.080> looks<00:06:38.289> like<00:06:38.469> that<00:06:38.650> is

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
know I tend to that looks like that is

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.529 
know I tend to that looks like that is
going<00:06:39.009> to<00:06:39.099> be<00:06:39.190> a<00:06:39.219> feature<00:06:39.520> available<00:06:40.000> as<00:06:40.360> well

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
going to be a feature available as well

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.420 
going to be a feature available as well
so<00:06:40.810> that's<00:06:41.229> an<00:06:41.409> exploded<00:06:41.860> view<00:06:41.889> of<00:06:42.219> the

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
so that's an exploded view of the

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.700 
so that's an exploded view of the
console<00:06:42.849> of<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.150> hardware<00:06:43.509> and<00:06:43.779> that's<00:06:44.380> kind

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
console of the hardware and that's kind

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.159 
console of the hardware and that's kind
of<00:06:44.830> an<00:06:44.979> overview<00:06:45.159> of<00:06:45.789> everything<00:06:46.419> that<00:06:46.930> we<00:06:47.020> got
