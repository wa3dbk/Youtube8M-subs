00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.260
 But then you will be dissolved in darkness. 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 Who then will tell about you? 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.420
 And in the end I will part with the soul, 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.840
 What will happen to the body? 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 Maybe I'm just a shadow? 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.080
 I see a goal: 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 Be yourself all the time, rule the whole army. 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.880
 I know myself - 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.400
 For the victory I will give everything that burned in my heart! 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.980
 (I'll give it all) 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.800
 But when you are dissolved in darkness, 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.520
 Who then will tell about you? 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.540
 And who will remember the whisper "Forgive ..."? 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.540
 At the end of the path ... 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.620
 No, I'm not afraid. 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.340
 I'm not afraid to leave! 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 (Not afraid!) 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.960
 (Not afraid to leave ...) 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.220
 It was holy, but for every sin I would not condemn you. 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.180
 Everything would start from scratch. 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.660
 Let life sometimes not like everyone else 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.960
 But I more than not was. 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.880
 Stand up again. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.140
 I will not fall for victory in the sky! 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.400
 But when you are dissolved in darkness, 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.280
 Who then will tell about you? 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.280
 And who will remember the whisper "Forgive ..."? 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.300
 At the end of the path ... 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.040
 No, I'm not afraid, 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.920
 I'm not afraid to leave. 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.840
 But then you will be dissolved in darkness. 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.580
 Who then will tell about you? 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.400
 And who will remember the whisper "Forgive ..."? 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.360
 At the end of the path ... 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.380
 No, I'm not afraid! 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.000
 I'm not afraid to leave! 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.840
 (Who will remember the whisper "Forgive ..."?) 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.600
 At the end of the path ... 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.720
 No, I'm not afraid! 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.620
 I'm not afraid to leave! 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.380
 (Not afraid!) 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.720
 (Not afraid to leave ...) 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.240
 (No, I am not afraid!..) 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.040
 (Not afraid to leave ...)
