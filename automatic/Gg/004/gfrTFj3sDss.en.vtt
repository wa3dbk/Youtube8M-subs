 we are in front of a video in which 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 I'm going to comment on a pretty subject 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.230
 quite interesting especially for the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.369

 normal of each day because what will you think in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.000
 the comments said subject which is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.040
 seeing in the title since it is important 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 for me and important for all my 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 family of my channel simply 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 We will begin to comment on this topic that is going 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 to deal with television and about 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 everything about youtube was a great 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 rivalry between the two platforms 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 different you already know that television 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 for a very long time it has been the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 reference for each and every one of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.320
 we simply if you want to look 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.760
 some audio thing if you want 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.680
 have fun for a few minutes always 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.480
 we have keeping in mind to go to the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.910
 television look at some in some 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 television network and therefore spend 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 while watching television what happens 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.910
 currently that youtube has come 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.400
 strength has come with much increase in 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.900
 content with many channels with many 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.490
 people who want to demonstrate 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.020
 that really television is a whore 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.210
 shit next to youtube and have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.979
 demonstrated that the audience really 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.620
 he's gone from television and he's gone 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.080
 directly to youtube why is it 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.030
 happening this simply because youtube 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.040
 has the ability to have much more 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 people more channels people 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.890
 which want to become famous by 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.810
 example want to gain audience or be it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 they want to have a good time they can not be in the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 television but instead if they can 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.220
 be on youtube because youtube is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.830
 open for everyone which 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.320
 wants to become a channel and that's what 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.119
 good from youtube and therefore it is what 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 that makes people stop going to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.869
 look at the television especially look 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.009
 fucking programs because that's what 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.780
 is currently happening in the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.369
 television and they go directly to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.590
 youtube because there will surely be some 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.820
 channel or there will be some content which will 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.320
 is going to hook and which you will like 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.970
 and therefore we are going to leave those 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 shit programs of television like this 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.750
 literally and you will see some channel 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.300
 of youtube that really is worth a lot 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.800
 the penalty that happens on youtube because no 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.780
 is on television and what is good 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.459
 of youtube simply that has more 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
 Expression capacity you can 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.680
 express what you like best on youtube 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.959
 and not 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.849
 express television on television 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.319
 sorry there are many opinions there are many 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.870
 things but above all you have to look 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.730
 of not saying some words in particular 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.349
 since otherwise the audience will send you 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.719
 to take for ass and therefore they are going to 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.219
 see another to another channel that does not happen in 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.900
 youtube because youtube there is a capacity 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.180
 of much larger expression a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.859
 much more content capacity than 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.989
 Much more fun hygiene and above all 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.639
 is that everyone can be like 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.530
 I said inside youtube thing that in 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.900
 television is always the same and 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.819
 final I think they end up boring a 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.840
 channel determined simply guys and 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.790
 girls I would like that in the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.379
 comments I think so you know about 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.239
 this topic to see if you think that youtube 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.040
 is eating television that the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.319
 television is being eaten by 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.049
 youtube like that with a passive voice but 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.849
 especially that you will think that from 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.290
 now youtube is being much more 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.840
 big the television is running 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.519
 back just because it does not innovate 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.919
 no innovation is always doing the same 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.079
 and so the same programs since 2000 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.459
 I almost do not know that there is almost I do not know how much 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.469
 if some television shows that 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.569
 you say kid you are doing with 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:18.449
 your life does not change youtube as 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.769
 I already say that the total 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.730
 YouTube community in Spain 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.890
 YouTube community 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.900
 international is being done every time 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.540
 bigger and I think that YouTube is the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.099
 new television which you can be 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.110
 quietly a couple of hours that do not 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.730
 you will get bored simply because there 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.049
 a plurality of videos that are 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.310
 impressive nothing more simply 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.560
 say the comments to see what 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.790
 you think about this topic I have already given what 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 mine in inside this video and I 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.180
 I would like you to give is yours
