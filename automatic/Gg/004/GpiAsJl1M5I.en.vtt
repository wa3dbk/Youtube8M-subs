00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.410
 among the heroes of many fairy tales you can often 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.020
 meet the dwarfs remember the boy 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.529
 Jacob transformed witch and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 dubbed nose amazing 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.050
 magic adventures fell to his lot 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.119
 it could not have been otherwise 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 fairy tale 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.020
 ancient Greek dwarf is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 on us and science and based on it 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.739
 technology began to be called 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.600
 nanotechnology 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 what kind of science is it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 nanotechnology much of what 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.480
 it used to be only in fairy tales became for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 us as usual 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.949
 the flying carpet has turned into a good all 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 known airliner and magic 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 mirror in the internet tv and such 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.740
 miracles did not happen with 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.570
 wizards but thanks to the development of science and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.689
 technology 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.439
 of course you all know what a meter is and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.479
 how many centimeters in it to measure 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.780
 smallest particles 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.590
 scientists have proposed a new unit on on 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 meter 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 he is one billionth of a meter 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.409
 to represent such a quantity we take 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.680
 ordinary hair he is very thin but 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.770
 not for nano technology by its standards 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.740
 the thickness of a human hair is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.270
 about 50 thousand on us 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.409
 meters this is no longer a dwarf giant and for 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.680
 nanotechnology he does not represent 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.759
 interest main object of study 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.689
 new science 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.770
 atoms and molecules their sizes are in 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.130
 ranges from one tenth to several 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.209
 nanometers first achievement 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.480
 Nanotechnology became an invention in 1981 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.540
 Swiss scientists in particular 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.350
 a microscope with his help failed 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.769
 move 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 single atoms and fragments of molecules in 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.590
 predefined places 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.440
 the microscope is called a tunnel 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.530
 scientists awarded the most significant 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:37.049
 award in the scientific world nobel 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:42.030
 premium but why move atoms and 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.599
 molecules turns out to be atoms and molecules from 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.430
 which is any substance 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.329
 differ in their properties from it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.519
 graphite pencil rod itself 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.700
 built of carbon atoms pretty 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.880
 soft but the material consisting of the same 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.630
 carbon atoms and in the form of nanotubes 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.209
 already much stronger than steel by opening 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.850
 the ability to build nanoparticles in 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.670
 new structures scientists realized that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.640
 material can be given earlier 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.550
 unusual for them are useful and very well 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.750
 on and quality having learned to move 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.819
 atoms and nanotechnology molecules from 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.760
 theoretical science has become a new 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 production technology any 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.060
 modern computer consists of hundreds 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.850
 million transistors each 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.340
 measures only a few dozen 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.860
 nanometers 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.980
 silver in the form of nanoparticles becomes 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.100
 deadly substance for many harmful 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.920
 bacteria is its property effectively 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.800
 applied in early healing dressings 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.930
 nano technology is used to 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.190
 production of high strength and 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.750
 insulation materials in the car and 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.840
 Aircraft scientists believe that 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.959
 soon in any industry and 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.530
 agriculture nano technology 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.200
 will become the main science of dwarfs 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.919
 able to make such changes in 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.500
 our lives that never dreamed of 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.350
 fairy tale writer look at the world 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.860
 closer and deeper delve into the essence 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.860
 of things
