so what I'm going to do is download
google<00:00:17.940> chrome<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.260> makes<00:00:19.710> any

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
google chrome and see if that makes any

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.759 
google chrome and see if that makes any
difference<00:00:20.539> but<00:00:21.539> i<00:00:21.600> should<00:00:21.930> probably<00:00:22.260> explain

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
difference but i should probably explain

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
difference but i should probably explain

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
even though i didn't go to any websites

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.899 
even though i didn't go to any websites
i<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:47.030> opened<00:01:47.240> up<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.250> internet<00:01:49.250> explorer

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
i just opened up the internet explorer

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.680 
i just opened up the internet explorer
but<00:01:50.210> still<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:51.229> froze<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.210> i'm<00:01:53.210> going<00:01:53.540> to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
but still it it froze so i'm going to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.070 
but still it it froze so i'm going to
attempt<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.140> open<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.740> but

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.380 

I<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:58.920> I'll<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.550> I'll<00:01:59.700> stop<00:02:00.090> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
I think what I'll do is I'll stop this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.060 
I think what I'll do is I'll stop this
recording<00:02:01.140> save<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.520> open<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.480> new

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
recording save this and open up a new

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.670 
recording save this and open up a new
recording<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.280> try<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.640> open<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.350> here<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.500> go

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
recording and try to open it here we go

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.290 
recording and try to open it here we go
and<00:02:07.950> hopefully<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.490> doesn't<00:02:08.700> freeze<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and hopefully it doesn't freeze the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.540 
and hopefully it doesn't freeze the
whole<00:02:09.420> computer<00:02:09.899> up

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.450

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
said it happens on firefox and so far on

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.610 
said it happens on firefox and so far on
internet<00:03:51.780> explorer<00:03:52.320> as<00:03:52.590> well<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:54.020> now<00:03:55.020> I'm

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
internet explorer as well so now I'm

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.850 
internet explorer as well so now I'm
going<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.950> restart<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.760> computer<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
going to restart the computer and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.460 
going to restart the computer and
download<00:03:58.910> google<00:03:59.910> chrome<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.240> I'm<00:04:00.840> gonna<00:04:01.020> see

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
download google chrome and I'm gonna see

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.030

if<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.770> happens<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.400> there<00:04:02.730> too<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.560> I'm<00:04:04.560> hoping

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
if it happens on there too so I'm hoping

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.600 
if it happens on there too so I'm hoping
that<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.370> doesn't<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:06.950> I'm<00:04:07.950> thinking<00:04:08.490> it

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
that it doesn't but I'm thinking it

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.480 
that it doesn't but I'm thinking it
probably<00:04:09.209> well<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.500> i<00:04:10.530> restarted<00:04:10.890> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
probably well so i restarted the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.900 
probably well so i restarted the
computer<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.870> opened<00:04:13.290> up<00:04:13.410> firefox<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.700> i'm

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
firefox and more than likely it's going

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.780 
firefox and more than likely it's going
to<00:04:20.130> crash<00:04:20.459> unless<00:04:22.340> something<00:04:23.340> drastic

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790

I'm going to shut this down right now
and<00:05:21.490> I'm<00:05:21.910> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.120> restart<00:05:22.360> i'm<00:05:22.990> going<00:05:23.200> to

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
and I'm going to restart i'm going to

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.480 
and I'm going to restart i'm going to
try<00:05:23.440> google<00:05:24.010> chrome<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:26.440> i<00:05:26.470> have<00:05:26.800> google

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
try google chrome so i have google

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.890 
try google chrome so i have google
chrome<00:05:27.760> open<00:05:28.030> now<00:05:28.480> i<00:05:29.460> restarted<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.610> computer

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
chrome open now i restarted the computer

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.380 
chrome open now i restarted the computer
obviously<00:05:31.900> because<00:05:32.290> it<00:05:32.440> was<00:05:32.560> frozen<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.520> i'm

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
obviously because it was frozen and i'm

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.500 
obviously because it was frozen and i'm
going<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.690> try<00:05:35.010> with<00:05:36.010> google<00:05:36.520> chrome<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:36.880> i'm

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
going to try with google chrome and i'm

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.240 
going to try with google chrome and i'm
thinking<00:05:37.870> it's<00:05:38.170> probably<00:05:38.380> going<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:38.890> do<00:05:39.040> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
thinking it's probably going to do the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.850 
thinking it's probably going to do the
same<00:05:39.490> thing<00:05:39.940> but<00:05:40.240> if<00:05:40.870> it<00:05:41.020> doesn't<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.650> guess

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
same thing but if it doesn't I guess

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.280 
same thing but if it doesn't I guess
google<00:05:42.370> chrome<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.970> my<00:05:43.180> new<00:05:43.360> browser<00:05:43.690> for

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
google chrome is my new browser for

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.010 
google chrome is my new browser for
windows<00:05:45.130> seven<00:05:45.640> so<00:05:46.350> like<00:05:47.350> i<00:05:47.500> said<00:05:47.530> before

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
windows seven so like i said before

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.690 
windows seven so like i said before
everything<00:05:50.020> worked<00:05:50.470> perfectly<00:05:50.560> fine<00:05:51.340> before

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
everything worked perfectly fine before

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.310 
everything worked perfectly fine before
i<00:05:51.940> upgraded<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.920> 64-bit<00:05:53.920> and<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:55.540> can<00:05:55.810> kind

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
i upgraded to 64-bit and I can kind

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.000 
i upgraded to 64-bit and I can kind
understand<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.970> browser's<00:05:58.630> crashing<00:05:59.410> but<00:05:59.980> I

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
understand the browser's crashing but I

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.810 
understand the browser's crashing but I
don't<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.940> makes<00:06:01.270> no<00:06:01.540> sense<00:06:01.570> why<00:06:02.640> the<00:06:03.640> whole

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
don't it makes no sense why the whole

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.040 
don't it makes no sense why the whole
system<00:06:04.180> crashes<00:06:05.170> when<00:06:06.420> when<00:06:07.420> I<00:06:07.450> go<00:06:07.840> on<00:06:08.020> a

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
system crashes when when I go on a

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.630 
system crashes when when I go on a
certain<00:06:08.530> website<00:06:09.780> so<00:06:10.780> let's<00:06:11.020> click<00:06:11.230> on

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
certain website so let's click on

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.180 
certain website so let's click on
scotiabank<00:06:12.640> CA<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.690> see<00:06:13.930> what<00:06:14.110> happens<00:06:14.620> i'm

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
scotiabank CA and see what happens i'm

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.310 
scotiabank CA and see what happens i'm
thinking<00:06:15.640> like<00:06:15.880> i<00:06:16.210> said<00:06:16.480> it's<00:06:16.720> going<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:17.050> crash

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
thinking like i said it's going to crash

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.900 
thinking like i said it's going to crash
again<00:06:17.830> but<00:06:18.780> yeah

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.990 

that<00:06:24.600> makes<00:06:24.870> absolutely<00:06:25.110> no<00:06:25.770> sense<00:06:25.950> and<00:06:26.790> this

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
that makes absolutely no sense and this

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.070 
that makes absolutely no sense and this
is<00:06:27.210> a<00:06:27.240> fresh<00:06:27.720> install<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.550> Windows<00:06:29.550> 7<00:06:30.090> so

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
is a fresh install of Windows 7 so

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.820 
is a fresh install of Windows 7 so
anyway<00:06:31.530> I'm<00:06:31.860> going<00:06:32.040> to<00:06:32.160> go<00:06:32.340> and<00:06:33.380> see<00:06:34.380> if<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:34.620> can

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
anyway I'm going to go and see if I can

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.220 
anyway I'm going to go and see if I can
figure<00:06:35.070> the<00:06:35.370> Sioux<00:06:35.640> and<00:06:35.910> in<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.450> meantime<00:06:36.660> if

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230
