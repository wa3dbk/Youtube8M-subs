00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
can see the hive is slightly poking out

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
can see the hive is slightly poking out
below<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> shoot<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.059> your

below it shoot it and that will be your

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
below it shoot it and that will be your
second<00:00:57.870> hive<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.489> move<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
second hive we can then move on to the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.369 
second hive we can then move on to the
next<00:01:00.690> map<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.039> containment<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.379> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
next map which is containment and this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.910 
next map which is containment and this
is<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.339> side<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:07.260> bridge<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is on the side of the bridge one of the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
is on the side of the bridge one of the
sides<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> bridge<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.720> believe

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
sides of the bridge I think I believe

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.250 
sides of the bridge I think I believe
this<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.479> ghost<00:01:12.479> side<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> bridge

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
this was the ghost side of the bridge

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.980 
this was the ghost side of the bridge
that<00:01:13.320> spawns<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.840> your

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that spawns in all you do is make your

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
that spawns in all you do is make your
way<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.680> around<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.090> side

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
way all the way around to the other side

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
way all the way around to the other side
of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> map<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> spawned<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:20.189> there

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of the map or if you spawned over there

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
of the map or if you spawned over there
then<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.330> turn<00:01:21.630> around

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
then all you have to do is turn around

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
then all you have to do is turn around
I'm<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.830> making<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.280> over<00:01:23.549> there

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I'm just making my way over there

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.530 
I'm just making my way over there
because<00:01:24.150> i<00:01:24.240> spawned<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> other<00:01:24.840> side<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
because i spawned on the other side and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.179 
because i spawned on the other side and
amazingly<00:01:27.540> no<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:27.900> saw<00:01:28.350> me<00:01:28.380> sneaking<00:01:28.920> around

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
amazingly no one saw me sneaking around

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.700 
amazingly no one saw me sneaking around
the<00:01:29.250> back<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.810> when<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.079> indeed<00:01:31.320> shooting
