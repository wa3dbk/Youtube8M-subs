all the Danish players got some

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.560 
all the Danish players got some

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
confidence that we can use for a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.770 
confidence that we can use for a
national<00:01:49.049> team<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> yes<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.460> come<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> for

national team and yes to come and for

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.359 
national team and yes to come and for
sure<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.470> Danish<00:01:52.770> hockey<00:01:53.100> but

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
sure it's good for Danish hockey but

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.590
