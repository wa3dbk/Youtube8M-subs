00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.810
 idea 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.030
 Further 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.400
 hryvnia 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.740
 he don't know 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 and let him be judged 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.509
 balls under the hood what 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.519
 here he is 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.519
 and at the plant interfere 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.089
 then I emphasize again 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.380
 what was going on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.289
 atr 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.180
 but it feels like a womanâ€™s time is fine 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.690
 It was 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 also the publication reports the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.030
 do so 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.590
 need to change 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 it happens 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 prim 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.670
 more than a thousand of that world 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 but also as a groove lead by product 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620
 five 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620
 simply 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.160
 in 5 5 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 care to relax 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 and then trained to survive ha 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 so why 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.530
 On one of them fly only not fly 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.350
 experience with great-grandmother 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.820
 ceilings problematic 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.300
 d it's not like that 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.300
 both cube reactor 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.500
 here they are who hid there like no one 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 there was a letter hid 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.940
 it's not that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 god will give up the spirit 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.459
 since i 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.459
 better fit yourself yes 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 but our discussions have not come true 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.729
 he 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.719
 summer 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.089
 here 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.069
 I don't even know 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.280
 as explained here I do not understand how you can 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.429
 a hundred years ago 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 however drama 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.059
 like this 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.729
 of money 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.729
 the same decision of the Diet East 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 company 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.649
 myself 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 a lot 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.369
 only when 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.869
 I 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.869
 b 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.229
 and I 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.279
 idea 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.729
 etc 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.090
 who is not trying 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.840
 nor can you win jericho 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 square yes 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.300
 play 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.300
 but 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.710
 So 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.009
 stock 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.529
 to 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.039
 all courts are genus
