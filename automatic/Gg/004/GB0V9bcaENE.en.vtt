00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
panel and I was one hundred percent

panel and I was one hundred percent
correct<00:00:10.170> as<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.530> believe<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.950> could<00:00:11.099> see

correct as I believe you could see

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.299 
correct as I believe you could see
through<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.389> case<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
through the the case that the that the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.609 
through the the case that the that the

special packing foam wasn't included and
i<00:00:17.190> am<00:00:17.460> i'm<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> double<00:00:18.660> check

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
i am i'm going to have to double check

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.210 
i am i'm going to have to double check
to<00:00:18.990> make<00:00:19.020> certain<00:00:19.140> i<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.740> paid<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.160> it

gigabyte<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> ain't<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.280> terabyte

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
gigabyte I think that ain't one terabyte

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.180 
gigabyte I think that ain't one terabyte
correct<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.450> did<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.149> fancy<00:00:45.420> wiring

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
correct I did not get the fancy wiring

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
correct I did not get the fancy wiring
because<00:00:47.190> i<00:00:47.399> personally<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:48.270> care<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
because i personally don't care that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.139 
because i personally don't care that
much<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> looks<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.710> inside<00:00:50.480> I<00:00:53.030> mean<00:00:54.030> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
much what it looks like inside I mean I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.869 
much what it looks like inside I mean I
know<00:00:54.180> um<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> looks<00:00:56.129> much<00:00:56.399> better<00:00:56.610> with

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
know um that it looks much better with

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
know um that it looks much better with
professional<00:00:57.420> wiring<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.129> doesn't

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
professional wiring but it just doesn't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.130 
professional wiring but it just doesn't
matter<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.699> much<00:01:02.840> here<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.890> video<00:01:05.070> card

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
matter that much here is the video card

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.190 
matter that much here is the video card
it's<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:08.420> 580<00:01:10.070> gtx<00:01:11.070> 580<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.180> looks<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.780> i'm

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it's a 580 gtx 580 but it looks like i'm

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
it's a 580 gtx 580 but it looks like i'm
afraid<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.740> actually<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.420> really<00:01:15.420> generic

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
afraid it's actually a really generic

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
afraid it's actually a really generic
card<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.979> sparkle<00:01:17.580> version<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.150> just

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
card the sparkle version which just

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
card the sparkle version which just
hearing<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.710> name<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.340> scaring

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
hearing the name of that it's scaring

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
hearing the name of that it's scaring
the<00:01:20.970> heck<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> me<00:01:22.549> I<00:01:24.409> am<00:01:25.409> deathly<00:01:25.770> afraid

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the heck out of me I am deathly afraid

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.730 
the heck out of me I am deathly afraid
of<00:01:26.400> putting<00:01:26.729> water<00:01:27.060> into<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.750> computer

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
of putting water into my computer

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.600 
of putting water into my computer
therefore<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.750> heat<00:01:30.960> sink<00:01:31.310> with<00:01:32.310> fan

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
therefore I got the heat sink with fan

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.749 
therefore I got the heat sink with fan
but<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> am<00:01:33.270> NOT<00:01:33.740> overclocking<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> system<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
got the 25 50 K processor so you know

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.899 
got the 25 50 K processor so you know
I've<00:01:48.270> already<00:01:48.450> talked<00:01:48.780> enough<00:01:49.049> um<00:01:49.880> let<00:01:50.880> me

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
I've already talked enough um let me

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
I've already talked enough um let me
focus<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.479> showing<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.140> inside<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> case

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
focus on showing the inside of the case

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.039 
focus on showing the inside of the case
and<00:01:53.159> once<00:01:53.790> again<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.299> check<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> specs

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
and once again just check out the specs

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.920 
and once again just check out the specs
in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.189> comments<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> want<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.780> you

in the comments if you want to if you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
in the comments if you want to if you
care<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> specs<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.390> ok

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
care that much what the specs are ok

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:23.750 
care that much what the specs are ok
here<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.630> go

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.149 

I<00:02:24.019> guess<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.170> next<00:02:25.290> thing<00:02:25.439> is<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.010> to

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
I guess the next thing is going to be to

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.800 
I guess the next thing is going to be to
fire<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.610> baby<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.180> make<00:02:27.269> certain<00:02:27.450> works

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
