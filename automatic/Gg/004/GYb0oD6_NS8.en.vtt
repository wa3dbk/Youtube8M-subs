00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
assistants I use this this cutting board

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.970 
assistants I use this this cutting board
actually<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:39.600> fold<00:04:39.900> these<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.410> they<00:04:40.650> slip

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
actually to fold these so that they slip

actually to fold these so that they slip
right<00:04:41.010> back<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:42.150> makes<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.510> less<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.169> a

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
right back in it just makes it less of a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.250 
right back in it just makes it less of a
chore<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.970> think<00:04:44.970> having<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.270> open<00:04:45.450> storage<00:04:45.900> is

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.420 
chore I think having the open storage is
a<00:04:47.010> good<00:04:47.280> thing<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.730> forces<00:04:48.510> one<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:49.260> be<00:04:49.560> neat

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
a good thing it forces one to be neat
