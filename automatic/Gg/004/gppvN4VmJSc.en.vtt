wanted to pass that on as well where we
start<00:00:38.160> from<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:39.120> rotation<00:00:39.809> because

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
start from is a one rotation because

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
start from is a one rotation because
unlike<00:00:40.860> Hollywood<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.640> movies<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.149> can't

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
unlike Hollywood and movies you can't

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.180 
unlike Hollywood and movies you can't
just<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> chunk<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.950> hawk<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.370> any<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:45.300> any

just go and chunk a hawk at any at any

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
just go and chunk a hawk at any at any
distance<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.210> rotation<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.750> going

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
distance because your rotation is going

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
distance because your rotation is going
to<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.020> off<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.980> probably<00:00:50.309> only<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> few<00:00:50.700> guys

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to be off it's probably only a few guys

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.130 
to be off it's probably only a few guys
in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> world<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> adjust

a<00:01:39.840> lot<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> guys<00:01:40.320> mess<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a lot of guys mess up they just want to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
a lot of guys mess up they just want to
muscle<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
muscle it in there when you do that you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
muscle it in there when you do that you
lose<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.829> form<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:44.659> foundation<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
lose your form and your foundation and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
lose your form and your foundation and
just<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.590> won't<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.040> consistent<00:01:47.820> enough<00:01:48.000> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
just it won't be consistent enough so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
just it won't be consistent enough so
start<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> bend<00:01:51.030> over<00:01:51.270> at

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
start like this I like to bend over at

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
start like this I like to bend over at
the<00:01:51.750> target<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.560> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.070> our

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the target that's going to be like our

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.620 
the target that's going to be like our
follow<00:01:53.490> through<00:01:53.759> stance<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.450> we're

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
follow through stance so we know we're

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630 
follow through stance so we know we're
using<00:01:54.869> our<00:01:55.079> whole<00:01:55.259> body<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
using our whole body because when we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.310 
using our whole body because when we
start<00:01:57.000> by<00:01:57.119> bending<00:01:57.360> over<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.750> straighten<00:01:58.229> up

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
start by bending over or straighten up

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.709 
start by bending over or straighten up
and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.310> well<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.729> drive<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
and then go into it as well I drive the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.050 
and then go into it as well I drive the
hawk<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:01.229> towards<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> target<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.790> kind

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
hawk out towards the target and I kind

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
hawk out towards the target and I kind
of<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.299> look<00:02:03.540> through<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.259> looking<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
of just look through it just looking it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590 
of just look through it just looking it
straight<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.490> they're<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.210> rock<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
straight at it they're going to rock the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690 
straight at it they're going to rock the
whole<00:02:06.810> body<00:02:07.049> back<00:02:07.320> lift<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.190> hawk<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
whole body back lift up the hawk and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.639 
whole body back lift up the hawk and
then<00:02:09.360> push<00:02:09.720> off<00:02:09.929> with<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.229> toes<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.619> your

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
then push off with the toes of your

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.640 
then push off with the toes of your
right<00:02:10.739> foot<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.300> let<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> fly<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.470> going

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
right foot and and let it fly it's going

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.820 
right foot and and let it fly it's going
to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
to
the<00:02:13.980> same<00:02:14.220> motion<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.850> driving<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.930> now

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
the same motion as driving in and now

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.290 
the same motion as driving in and now
with<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> hammer<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.760> case<00:02:17.970> it's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
with the hammer just in this case it's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.070 
with the hammer just in this case it's
it's<00:02:18.600> across<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> way<00:02:19.560> there<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.870> then<00:02:21.870> just

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
it's across the way there and then just

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.870 
it's across the way there and then just
one<00:02:22.260> fluid<00:02:22.500> motion<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.070> follow<00:02:23.310> through<00:02:23.610> just

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
one fluid motion and follow through just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.400 
one fluid motion and follow through just
keep<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.330> down<00:02:24.480> don't<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:25.140> about<00:02:25.260> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
keep going down don't think about a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.810 
keep going down don't think about a
release<00:02:25.740> don't<00:02:26.100> worry<00:02:26.280> about<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.640> let<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
release don't worry about it let it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.270 
release don't worry about it let it
naturally<00:02:27.090> fly<00:02:27.690> out<00:02:27.900> when<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.920> when

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
naturally fly out when it's just when

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
naturally fly out when it's just when
it's<00:02:29.460> just<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:30.000> wanting<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> fly<00:02:31.050> out

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
it's just going to be wanting to fly out

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.590 
it's just going to be wanting to fly out
in<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.680> throw<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.280> let<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:32.880> its<00:02:32.910> rotation

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
in that throw and let it do its rotation

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.810 
in that throw and let it do its rotation
and<00:02:33.720> throw<00:02:33.990> into<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> target<00:02:34.560> Hawks<00:02:35.400> throw

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
and throw into the target Hawks throw

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.090 
and throw into the target Hawks throw
themselves<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.890> at<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
themselves you just have to be at the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.710 
themselves you just have to be at the
right<00:02:38.280> spot<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.910> consistent<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.690> can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
right spot and be consistent you can

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.000 
right spot and be consistent you can
make<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.140> work<00:02:40.290> every<00:02:40.560> time

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
make it work every time

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.040 
make it work every time
accuracy<00:02:41.610> comes<00:02:41.910> later<00:02:42.210> I'm<00:02:42.390> not<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.690> accurate

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
accuracy comes later I'm not as accurate

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.840 
accuracy comes later I'm not as accurate
as<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> Hawks<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:43.980> I'd<00:02:44.100> like<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.580> but

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
as with the Hawks as I'd like to be but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.820 
as with the Hawks as I'd like to be but
it<00:02:45.120> sure<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.420> fun<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.560> we're<00:02:46.740> going

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it sure is fun so here we go we're going

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.410 
it sure is fun so here we go we're going
to<00:02:46.920> try<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.820> right<00:02:48.030> side<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
to try to be on the right side of the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.780 
to try to be on the right side of the
target<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> don't<00:02:49.050> like<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.380> GoPro<00:02:49.850> alrighty

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
target so I don't like my GoPro alrighty

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.280 
target so I don't like my GoPro alrighty
there<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.600> high<00:02:54.810> there<00:02:55.080> but

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
there it is it's a little high there but

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 
there it is it's a little high there but
that's<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> perfect<00:02:55.830> 45<00:02:56.400> degree<00:02:56.760> angle<00:02:57.090> stick

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
that's the perfect 45 degree angle stick

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.060 
that's the perfect 45 degree angle stick
that<00:02:57.480> we're<00:02:57.660> looking<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.710> find<00:02:58.950> that

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
that we're looking for if you find that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.400 
that we're looking for if you find that
your<00:02:59.220> Hawk<00:02:59.400> sticks<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.960> handle<00:03:01.260> down

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
your Hawk sticks to with the handle down

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.440 
your Hawk sticks to with the handle down
you're<00:03:02.190> too<00:03:02.400> close<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.850> you're<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.060> not

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you're too close and you're not not

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.850 
you're too close and you're not not
allowing<00:03:03.930> for<00:03:04.080> enough<00:03:04.290> rotation

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
allowing for enough rotation

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.070 
allowing for enough rotation
you<00:03:05.430> want<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.730> right<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.060> 45<00:03:06.480> degrees<00:03:06.870> if

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
you want it right out of 45 degrees if

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.990 
you want it right out of 45 degrees if
you<00:03:07.170> find<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.530> your<00:03:07.650> handles<00:03:07.950> too<00:03:08.160> high<00:03:08.760> up

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
you find that your handles too high up

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.630
