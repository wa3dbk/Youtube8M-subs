00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
in the bottom to burn up by the way I've

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.179 
in the bottom to burn up by the way I've
got<00:01:52.640> my<00:01:52.969> heat<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.479> high<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.679> now<00:01:54.859> it's<00:01:55.099> about

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
to put it on a strainer to cool down and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.589 
to put it on a strainer to cool down and
as<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:09.739> cooling<00:02:10.039> down<00:02:10.160> if<00:02:10.759> we<00:02:11.329> still

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
as it's cooling down if we still

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.050 
as it's cooling down if we still
continue<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.200> cook<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.489> that's<00:02:13.700> why<00:02:13.879> it's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
continue to cook so that's why it's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.710 
continue to cook so that's why it's
important<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.140> turn<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.620> off<00:02:15.860> after<00:02:16.720> two

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
important that you turn it off after two

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.180 
important that you turn it off after two
to<00:02:18.049> three<00:02:18.079> minutes<00:02:18.769> three<00:02:19.190> minutes<00:02:19.220> max<00:02:20.030> and

I'll<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.430> put<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:22.940> strainer<00:02:23.269> to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
I'll just put it in the strainer to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.130 
I'll just put it in the strainer to
drain<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.859> oil<00:02:24.890> I'll<00:02:25.640> just<00:02:25.910> let<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.269> drain<00:02:26.690> a
