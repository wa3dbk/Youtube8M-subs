00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 yes, here it is my first little one 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.250
 children's book I'm very proud of that 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.930
 I still have it on the market this year 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.849
 could bring it means the trip to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.370
 vegan against mona and feather one like that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.160
 strong friendship and yes it is peace 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 this is an eight year old girl 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 Dictators has many animals her one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.170
 golden retriever named monika 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 In the 20th century, you often come to know 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.470
 and she actually has one 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.630
 I have not got that piggy yet and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 This little piglet is called mona 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.140
 and mona is a very special one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.309
 be silent because it can be in my book 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 read, write and even speak and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.610
 the pigs in society have become 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.079
 always tells you that you are tall 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.559
 that you follow in the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.750
 van pick her up and borrowed it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.250
 So is that the paradise of the animals so 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.680
 to say and we also have one 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 map found by the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 mother of flier the animal rights activist 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.050
 that is vegan actually exists and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 Although started right next door 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 African the big gray proboscis 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.699
 pigs how the pig tells itself 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.860
 you know as elephants and the know 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.450
 the way to vegans, of course, too 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.619
 a bit sad because the elephants 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 Know when you die 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.240
 and then run loss to their 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.799
 resting place and they have so the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.330
 It is also very difficult to miss because of that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 Of course a paradise is also for 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.470
 all ivory believe so sad 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.820
 the elephants a bit so you look 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.900
 they know the way to get started 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.850
 that is what my children are calling 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 Of course not someone in the children's book 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.000
 do you think how long is that that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.189
 Wonderful world every little child likes 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.030
 That's why there is one there 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.810
 higher and all live happily and in 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.970
 harmony 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.540
 but until then be farther away 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 because warrior roof one day thanks woman 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.869
 tastes of my showing 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 Frauke Weiss stayed with the little pig 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.320
 to take lessons 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.510
 Of course, this is a huge scandal 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.700
 from the one for no animals with the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.260
 take lessons and it solves too 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.080
 many a scandal at the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.940
 Director human decides a great 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.470
 Swallow lessons about the topic 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.400
 Vegetarian regulated on the topic 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.040
 spoken vegan 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.440
 That's why we do it quite innovatively 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.899
 contemporary the dorffest summer party 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.000
 is vegan and there are 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.670
 Of course some of the butchers of the butcher 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 in the village is of course not thrilled 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.709
 that this year no finished 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.070
 is slaughtered so mona must 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.790
 should disappear brother 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.800
 be introduced 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 but it is a beautiful story 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.769
 no tears colossus is a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.330
 a bit exciting but is a very exciting 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.050
 very nice story with a happy 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.660
 but I do not want to reveal too much 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.010
 there will be several parts because they 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.110
 create is not in this book yet 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.519
 to come to vegans but that will 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.580
 then next one can happen 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.100
 of course I have it too 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.300
 completely vegan produce 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.690
 that sounds a bit strange now 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.500
 But every book is usually with you 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.760
 glued bone glue that was also something 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.959
 not so many years ago 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.519
 not aware that he is reading this book 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.570
 it would be made a few years ago 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.890
 probably animal 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.860
 because I'm just there 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.630
 was not informed enough 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.880
 But it is also a daily process 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.440
 I still learn how in which of the nation 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.900
 Products actually animal 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.120
 Ingredients are really difficult 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.760
 knows that you are on the dock as 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.340
 somehow vegans are doing everything right 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 but it explains quite martin towards 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.959
 production this book is one of the 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.200
 first deliberately vegan so non-violent 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.690
 protect the environment and free of bones 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.580
 beeswax or other ingredients 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.300
 animal origin industrial 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.640
 hardcover books was printed software 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.310
 an acid-free chlorine-free bleached 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.319
 Fcs defines recycling with paper 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 paper awarded the blue 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.209
 Angel complete product freedom can 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.060
 but not 100 percent guaranteed 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.920
 there will be the paper used 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.230
 possibly share of these substances 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.299
 contains that is sad so even 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.060
 loses a normal writing pad buys 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.130
 or you can have it in your hand 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.900
 also be there that animal there 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.060
 products were used that starts 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.890
 namely in the pressure behind it again no 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.049
 for our colors so he sees it 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.269
 very complex topic but i can 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.849
 this means to create the vegan 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.860
 and if you have interest here 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.920
 maybe to look at your children 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.359
 or maybe to give friends 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.280
 So children love children 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.549
 and somehow it stays a bit too 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.450
 about it if it is not nice if we 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:29.560
 everyone would live like in a vegan way 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.470
 harmony and harmony that was it for now 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.139
 to look forward to the afternoon for me 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.639
 of course, if you also diligently read the book 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.150
 order because I get 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.910
 Unfortunately , a dealer is not like that 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.700
 excited because the book does not list 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.260
 or sell because yes the society 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.850
 is not so nice when it gets up 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.180
 once also be fed children vegan 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.650
 should 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.600
 in the course, of course, a certain 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.520
 market together speak that one 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.539
 political lobby behind it and if so 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.200
 also the red ones pay for vegans 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.200
 thank you bye
