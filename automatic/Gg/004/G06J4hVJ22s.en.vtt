00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.140
 Y 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.450
 I have tried many backpacks because the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.869
 subject is always the same the weight is 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.000
 criminal and the backs end up ground and 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.850
 that you have this bag really this is 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 for my day to day 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.290
 which for me is fantastic because it opens 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.290
 behind all material is here 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.510
 for example that is when you go to places 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.030
 as always you carry the backpack in the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.520
 back then the sites for example 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.590
 the ramblas at night or somewhere like that 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.840
 where can this be much more negative 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.000
 and you can approach to steal it 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.550
 here there is nothing although I have several 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.699
 camera bodies usually the one 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.900
 more I use 700 cruiser cell that 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.780
 it's a camera 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.780
 good very versatile even when to 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.970
 Sometimes I will make my trips because I do not 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.580
 whether it's a report that is on vacation or 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.000
 of what is good the fact that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.310
 have in a moment the flash then you 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.750
 help is a camera that you can remove 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.200
 the engine below and that gives a measure 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.610
 more or less reduced I use this optics 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.340
 which is quite versatile because it 's a 28 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.850
 300 evidently the luminosity is 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.400
 quite reduced but we compensated 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.400
 with which this high sensitivity camera is 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.030
 the quality is very good obviously 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.760
 like I move better in the short 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.400
 distances this optic always goes 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.400
 accompanied by a 50 14 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.850
 and it is accompanied 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 24 14 uses a flash 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:04.490
 in this case is the 900 agreement should be 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.490
 that of 900 had evidently and with 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.239
 and with the sensor to shoot 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.440
 the flash to different power take out the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.660
 flash the camera in a moment 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.210
 determined then to make portraits or 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.040
 my heart was going very well 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.870
 and my head sometimes works much better 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.520
 when I use this camera is the one 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.080
 I used for my reports more 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.069
 personal 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.239
 then I, as you can see, I am a little 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:41.460
 old since then what I use is this 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:43.810
 it's a law k a m 6 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.010
 it's a camera 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.890
 and equally interchangeable objectives 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.689
 obviously the screen is not digital 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.409
 it's an analog camera and good for me 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:03.489
 it's a wonder of all there are people who 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.310
 works with a 35 am and the 35 is a 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.830
 optics that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 I never liked to say the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.770
 I find that sometimes it falls short already 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.239
 sometimes it stays big then this is 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:21.010
 a 28 28 later we have to use it 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:26.829
 very little 90 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.810
 28 and 50 is not the concept of the day to 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.300
 day of the newspaper 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.870
 to edit is a concept much more than 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.780
 the reports with time where it is not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.270
 what do you have until you see it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.730
 let's say grow up and there you will be a little 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.770
 the professional in knowing that he can 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.510
 have and that he has done his job in the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.700
 moment to take the shots as god 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.010
 manda really worth a lot of money but 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.530
 it really lasts many years you say what 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.870
 it's not a receipt it's selling for a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.360
 reflex camera we have to 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.020
 pay 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.420
 five thousand or six thousand euros and that that 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.000
 camera only have a life of four or 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.210
 five years then that's really me 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.680
 it seems that there is in the digital yes that we 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.800
 we have let take all 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.800
 professionals a little bit hair but
