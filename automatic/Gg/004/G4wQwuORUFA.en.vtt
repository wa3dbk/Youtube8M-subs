00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
team on paper looks incredible but

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.420

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
wasn't the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.390 
wasn't the
now<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.360> won<00:04:27.750> almost<00:04:28.080> all<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.830> games<00:04:29.040> i<00:04:29.190> paid

but<00:04:29.669> some<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.240> them<00:04:30.360> could<00:04:30.720> have<00:04:30.780> been<00:04:30.960> more

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
but some of them could have been more

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.360 
but some of them could have been more
convincing<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.770> might<00:04:31.889> be<00:04:32.010> because<00:04:32.160> i'm

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370
