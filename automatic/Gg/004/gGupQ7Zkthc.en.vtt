so<00:00:00.810> why<00:00:01.050> does<00:00:01.290> your<00:00:01.469> orthodontist<00:00:02.159> perform<00:00:02.700> a

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so why does your orthodontist perform a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.619 
so why does your orthodontist perform a
frantic<00:00:03.270> analysis<00:00:03.959> well<00:00:04.609> in<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.060> CD<00:00:06.390> right

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
frantic analysis well in the CD right

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.390 
frantic analysis well in the CD right
here<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.990> have<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> sit<00:00:07.379> parametric<00:00:07.859> analysis

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
here we have a sit parametric analysis

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.290 
here we have a sit parametric analysis
tab<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.750> we<00:00:09.960> want<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> use<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.940> as<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.179> can

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
upper jaw and to cranial base so let's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.709 
upper jaw and to cranial base so let's
see<00:00:44.879> how<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:47.180> we'll<00:00:48.180> move<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
see how we do it we'll move to the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
see how we do it we'll move to the
summary<00:00:49.200> immediately<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.129> pretty

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
summary immediately so we can pretty

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
summary immediately so we can pretty
much<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> look<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:54.199> measurements<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.320> how

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
much have a look at measurements and how

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
much have a look at measurements and how
you<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.730> points<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.480> put

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you do it so we do it with points we put

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
you do it so we do it with points we put
that's<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.680> point<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.190> here

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that's it we put one point right here

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.020 
that's it we put one point right here
and<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> point<00:01:01.010> from<00:01:02.010> these<00:01:02.219> points<00:01:02.699> we

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and this is a point from these points we

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.380 
and this is a point from these points we
are<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.379> lines<00:01:05.010> let's<00:01:06.000> say<00:01:06.210> as

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
are going to get some lines let's say as

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.899 
are going to get some lines let's say as
an<00:01:06.510> example<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.189> put<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.610> point

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
an example here see we put one point

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.460 
an example here see we put one point
here<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> corner<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
here which is the corner of this of the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.640 
here which is the corner of this of the
jaw<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.869> extremity<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.409> jaw<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
jaw and the extremity of the jaw the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
jaw and the extremity of the jaw the
most<00:01:13.920> forward<00:01:14.310> point<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> jaw<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> right

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
most forward point of the jaw is right

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
most forward point of the jaw is right
here<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.930> trace<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.500> line<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> becomes<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
here and we trace a line that becomes a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.070 
here and we trace a line that becomes a
plane<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:20.060> again<00:01:21.060> from<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.960> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
plane and then again from there we can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.190 
plane and then again from there we can
deduct<00:01:22.880> from<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.000> reference<00:01:24.540> plane<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.049> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
deduct from a reference plane which is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
deduct from a reference plane which is
right<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.220> deduct<00:01:26.490> an<00:01:26.700> angle<00:01:27.240> having

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
right here we can deduct an angle having

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
right here we can deduct an angle having
those<00:01:28.350> two<00:01:28.530> lines<00:01:28.740> there's<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.340> angle<00:01:29.640> called

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
those two lines there's an angle called

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.789 
those two lines there's an angle called
the<00:01:30.150> mandibular<00:01:30.570> plane<00:01:30.900> angle<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.560> case

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the mandibular plane angle in this case

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.109 
the mandibular plane angle in this case
which<00:01:32.670> depending<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.390> how<00:01:34.579> small<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.850> will

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
which depending on how small it is will

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.840 
which depending on how small it is will
give<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> angulation<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.310> lower<00:01:38.490> jaw

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
give you the angulation of the lower jaw

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
give you the angulation of the lower jaw
in<00:01:39.090> relation<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.500> base<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> cranium

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
in relation to the base of the cranium

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.960 
in relation to the base of the cranium
so<00:01:41.700> these<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.890> skeletal<00:01:43.890> measurements<00:01:44.490> there

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so these are skeletal measurements there

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.359 
so these are skeletal measurements there
are<00:01:45.060> quite<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> few<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.290> measures<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
are quite a few this one measures the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
are quite a few this one measures the
position<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> upper<00:01:48.750> jaw<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.530> relation<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
position of the upper jaw in relation to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
position of the upper jaw in relation to
the<00:01:50.189> plane<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> reference<00:01:51.240> plane<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the plane to the reference plane this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.330 
the plane to the reference plane this
one<00:01:52.380> will<00:01:52.560> measure<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.759> lower<00:01:53.939> jaw<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> many

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
one will measure the lower jaw so many

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179 
one will measure the lower jaw so many
many<00:01:56.549> different<00:01:56.969> measurements<00:01:57.420> possible<00:01:58.189> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
many different measurements possible so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
many different measurements possible so
the<00:01:59.310> also<00:01:59.579> done<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> by<00:02:00.149> getting<00:02:00.659> those

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the also done is by getting those

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.580 
the also done is by getting those
measurements<00:02:01.590> we'll<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.310> able<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.700> assess<00:02:03.590> how

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
measurements we'll be able to assess how

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.850 
measurements we'll be able to assess how
the<00:02:05.100> upper<00:02:05.399> jaw<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.729> located<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:07.409> relation<00:02:07.829> to

you<00:02:13.709> can<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> two<00:02:14.250> lines<00:02:14.459> now<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.000> this

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you can see the two lines now and this

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
you can see the two lines now and this
little<00:02:15.780> tiny<00:02:16.080> angle<00:02:16.319> measures<00:02:16.920> the

to the projection of the lower jaw so

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.240 
to the projection of the lower jaw so
these<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> bony<00:02:26.730> parts<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:29.040> face

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
measure the angulation or I should say

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.110 
measure the angulation or I should say
the<00:02:39.390> projection<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.440> upper<00:02:41.120> tooth

measure the angulation of the lower

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
measure the angulation of the lower

tooth or do all these measurements in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.670 
tooth or do all these measurements in
relation<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.629> see<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> blue<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
angulation here so all these

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.940 
angulation here so all these
measurements<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:01.200> are<00:03:01.819> being<00:03:03.170> set<00:03:04.170> up<00:03:04.409> sorry

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
measurements now are being set up sorry

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.559 
measurements now are being set up sorry
or<00:03:05.220> being<00:03:05.760> set<00:03:06.500> into<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> table<00:03:08.359> where<00:03:09.359> you<00:03:09.390> have

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
or being set into a table where you have

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.630 
or being set into a table where you have
the<00:03:09.720> norm<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.829> some<00:03:11.099> differences

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
the norm and you have some differences

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.819 
the norm and you have some differences
and<00:03:11.879> if<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.299> don't<00:03:12.450> remember<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.840> angles<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
and if you don't remember the angles you

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.009 
and if you don't remember the angles you
can<00:03:14.010> always<00:03:14.849> go<00:03:15.420> back<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:17.480> what<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> angle

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
can always go back to what the angle

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.839 
can always go back to what the angle
means<00:03:19.169> as<00:03:19.410> an<00:03:19.590> example<00:03:19.919> facial<00:03:20.519> angle

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
means as an example facial angle

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.390 
means as an example facial angle
measures<00:03:21.299> from<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.169> reference<00:03:22.620> plane<00:03:22.859> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
measures from this reference plane the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.800 
measures from this reference plane the
projection<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:25.310> chin<00:03:26.310> point<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:27.329> it's<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.630> very

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
projection of chin point so it's a very

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.650 
projection of chin point so it's a very
important<00:03:28.200> analysis<00:03:28.739> in<00:03:28.859> orthodontics<00:03:29.459> and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
important analysis in orthodontics and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.409 
important analysis in orthodontics and
the<00:03:30.660> orthodontist<00:03:31.379> is<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:34.340> great<00:03:35.419> tool

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
the orthodontist is really a great tool

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.949 
the orthodontist is really a great tool
to<00:03:37.340> allow<00:03:38.340> him<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.849> measure<00:03:39.090> how<00:03:39.510> your<00:03:39.720> jaws

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
to allow him to measure how your jaws

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.379 
to allow him to measure how your jaws
fit<00:03:40.319> into<00:03:40.829> your<00:03:41.280> face<00:03:41.489> by<00:03:41.730> using<00:03:41.940> Seafarer

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
fit into your face by using Seafarer

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.449 
fit into your face by using Seafarer
metrics<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.739> see<00:03:43.949> here<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.280> one

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
metrics so you can see here it's one

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.119 
metrics so you can see here it's one
type<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.699> malocclusion<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.590> can<00:03:46.769> see<00:03:46.949> that

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
type of malocclusion you can see that

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.300 
type of malocclusion you can see that
these<00:03:47.430> are<00:03:47.669> measurements<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.799> upper<00:03:50.129> jaw

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
these are measurements of the upper jaw

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.699 
these are measurements of the upper jaw
as<00:03:50.489> an<00:03:50.609> example<00:03:50.940> here<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.419> a<00:03:51.449> bit<00:03:51.660> more<00:03:51.959> forward

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
as an example here is a bit more forward

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.740 
as an example here is a bit more forward
so<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.549> upper<00:03:53.790> jaw<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.209> case<00:03:54.419> would<00:03:54.629> be

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
so the upper jaw in this case would be

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.500 
so the upper jaw in this case would be
probably<00:03:54.959> more<00:03:55.230> forward<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.829> should<00:03:56.010> be

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
probably more forward and it should be

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.720 
probably more forward and it should be
then<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.810> one<00:03:58.049> measures<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.709> lower<00:03:58.889> jaw<00:03:59.160> so

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
then this one measures the lower jaw so

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.129 
then this one measures the lower jaw so
then<00:03:59.879> we<00:04:00.000> can<00:04:00.150> see<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.449> lower<00:04:00.629> jaw<00:04:00.900> in

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
then we can see the lower jaw in

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.379 
then we can see the lower jaw in
relation<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.799> norm<00:04:02.069> is<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.370> bit<00:04:02.639> less<00:04:03.090> so

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
relation to the norm is a bit less so

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.339 
relation to the norm is a bit less so
the<00:04:03.629> lower<00:04:03.810> jaw<00:04:04.049> would<00:04:04.169> be<00:04:04.319> set<00:04:04.560> more<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.609> or

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
the lower jaw would be set more in or

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.559 
the lower jaw would be set more in or
retro<00:04:07.349> Pethick<00:04:07.829> as<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:08.160> say<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.180> then<00:04:09.299> we<00:04:09.419> can

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
retro Pethick as we say and then we can

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.670 
retro Pethick as we say and then we can
look<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.139> different<00:04:10.949> one<00:04:11.099> where<00:04:11.810> in<00:04:12.810> this

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
look at a different one where in this

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.089 
look at a different one where in this
case<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.780> lower<00:04:15.959> jaw<00:04:16.199> is<00:04:16.320> actually<00:04:16.709> forward

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
case the lower jaw is actually forward

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.979 
case the lower jaw is actually forward
as<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.519> see<00:04:17.699> now<00:04:17.820> again<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.810> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
as you can see now again this is the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.080 
as you can see now again this is the
projection<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> lower<00:04:19.829> jaw<00:04:20.099> so<00:04:20.910> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
projection of the lower jaw so the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.540 
projection of the lower jaw so the
measurement<00:04:21.570> now<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.959> over<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.830> limits<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.370> or

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
measurement now is over the limits so or

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.120 
measurement now is over the limits so or
actually<00:04:24.090> higher<00:04:24.330> than<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.599> norm<00:04:25.469> so<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
actually higher than the norm so the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.379 
actually higher than the norm so the
lower<00:04:26.310> jaw<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.729> actually

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
lower jaw is actually

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.980 
lower jaw is actually
rusev<00:04:27.870> or<00:04:28.110> prognathic<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:30.030> one<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.599> shows

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
rusev or prognathic this one to shows

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.899 
rusev or prognathic this one to shows
you<00:04:31.139> that<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.379> upper<00:04:31.680> jaw<00:04:31.889> is<00:04:32.250> actually

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
you that the upper jaw is actually

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.020 
you that the upper jaw is actually
retrognathia<00:04:33.449> or<00:04:34.050> set<00:04:34.379> back<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:35.189> the<00:04:35.490> face

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
retrognathia or set back in the face

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.300 
retrognathia or set back in the face
so<00:04:36.599> all<00:04:36.810> these<00:04:36.990> measurements<00:04:37.590> are<00:04:37.710> skeletal

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
so all these measurements are skeletal

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.969 
so all these measurements are skeletal
and<00:04:38.460> we<00:04:38.819> look<00:04:38.969> also<00:04:39.180> at<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.569> Dental<00:04:40.259> alveolar

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
and we look also at the Dental alveolar

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.059 
and we look also at the Dental alveolar
meaning<00:04:41.310> where<00:04:41.969> is<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.449> upper<00:04:42.900> incisor<00:04:43.409> as<00:04:43.860> we

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
meaning where is the upper incisor as we

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.969 
meaning where is the upper incisor as we
saw<00:04:44.250> before<00:04:45.139> position<00:04:46.139> in<00:04:46.319> this<00:04:46.500> case<00:04:46.740> would

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
saw before position in this case would

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.619 
saw before position in this case would
be<00:04:47.009> forward<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:50.490> lower<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:51.180> lower<00:04:51.330> jaw

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
be forward and the lower the lower jaw

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.360 
be forward and the lower the lower jaw
at<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.840> low<00:04:51.960> tooth<00:04:52.289> which<00:04:52.949> is<00:04:53.159> this

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
at the low tooth which is this

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.350 
at the low tooth which is this
measurement<00:04:54.030> would<00:04:54.810> be<00:04:55.819> less<00:04:56.819> so<00:04:57.120> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
measurement would be less so the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.559 
measurement would be less so the
orthodontist<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:58.469> we<00:04:58.650> wants<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.430> bring<00:04:59.759> every

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
orthodontist but we wants to bring every

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.749 
orthodontist but we wants to bring every
measurements<00:05:01.229> towards<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.069> norm<00:05:02.400> by<00:05:03.210> either

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
measurements towards the norm by either

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.580 
measurements towards the norm by either
braces<00:05:05.759> appliances<00:05:06.689> or<00:05:06.900> even<00:05:07.199> sometimes

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
braces appliances or even sometimes

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.360 
braces appliances or even sometimes
surgery<00:05:08.180> thank<00:05:09.180> you
