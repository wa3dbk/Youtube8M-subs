00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
would be checking now one of the main

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
would be checking now one of the main
problems<00:00:30.660> why<00:00:30.900> our<00:00:31.050> mole<00:00:31.260> won't<00:00:31.590> run<00:00:31.949> very

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

problems why our mole won't run very
well<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> air<00:00:33.600> filter<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.350> dirty<00:00:35.239> now

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
well is that the air filter is dirty now

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.860 
well is that the air filter is dirty now
I'll<00:00:36.480> show<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.930> air<00:00:37.380> filter<00:00:41.660> you'll<00:00:42.660> see

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
I'll show you my air filter you'll see

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.940 
I'll show you my air filter you'll see
I've<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.440> used<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.399> bit<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.059> sponge<00:00:45.890> now<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
I've just used a bit of a sponge now the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.180 
I've just used a bit of a sponge now the
reason<00:00:47.610> why<00:00:47.730> I'll<00:00:47.850> use<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.690> because

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
reason why I'll use this is because

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.810 
reason why I'll use this is because
Honda<00:00:50.190> wanted<00:00:50.570> $45<00:00:51.590> for<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> original<00:00:53.550> air

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
Honda wanted $45 for the original air

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.849 
Honda wanted $45 for the original air
filter<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.640> refused<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.850> pay<00:00:57.000> $45<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.649> for

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
filter which I refused to pay $45 so for

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340 
filter which I refused to pay $45 so for
the<00:00:58.920> last<00:00:59.160> three<00:00:59.609> years<00:00:59.690> I've<00:01:00.690> been<00:01:01.079> using

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the last three years I've been using

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.219 
the last three years I've been using
this<00:01:01.590> piece<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.039> sponge<00:01:02.750> not<00:01:03.750> only<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this piece of sponge not only was it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.219 
this piece of sponge not only was it
free<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> hasn't<00:01:06.420> caused<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.960> any

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
free but it hasn't caused me any

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.730 
free but it hasn't caused me any
problems<00:01:07.830> whatsoever<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> would

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
problems whatsoever so what I would

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
problems whatsoever so what I would
normally<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.490> maybe<00:01:11.700> spray<00:01:12.060> some

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
normally do is maybe spray some

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.899 
normally do is maybe spray some
degreaser<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.250> oily<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
degreaser on this if it was oily or I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
degreaser on this if it was oily or I
just<00:01:15.210> rinse<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.720> under<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> tap<00:01:16.400> give<00:01:17.400> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
just rinse it out under the tap give it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.480 
just rinse it out under the tap give it
a<00:01:17.549> squeeze<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> let<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.630> dry<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> then

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
a squeeze out and let it dry and then

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
a squeeze out and let it dry and then
put<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> straight<00:01:20.850> back<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.229> do

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
put a straight back on what you can do

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.170 
put a straight back on what you can do
to<00:01:22.500> test<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> air<00:01:23.400> filter<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.820> take

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to test if it is the air filter is take

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.719 
to test if it is the air filter is take
it<00:01:24.330> off<00:01:24.479> start<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.470> mower<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> starts

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it off start your mower and if it starts

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390 
it off start your mower and if it starts
running<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.799> air<00:01:28.979> filter

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
running really well then your air filter

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.109 
running really well then your air filter
is<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.909> problem<00:01:31.400> I'll<00:01:32.400> clean<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> later

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
is the problem I'll clean that later

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.020 
is the problem I'll clean that later
because<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.869> dirty<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.759> another

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
because it is very dirty now another

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.880 
because it is very dirty now another
reason<00:01:36.270> why<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.840> ma<00:01:36.960> might<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.710> running

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
reason why your ma might not be running

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.600 
reason why your ma might not be running
well<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> fuel<00:01:39.150> filter<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.610> blocked

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
well is that the fuel filter is blocked

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.050 
well is that the fuel filter is blocked
now<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:43.140> rare<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.729> fuel

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
now this would be really rare for a fuel

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.920 
now this would be really rare for a fuel
filter<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.899> blocked<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.810> even

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
filter to be blocked but I don't even

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450 
filter to be blocked but I don't even
know<00:01:49.079> where<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> model<00:01:50.220> because

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
know where it is on this model because

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.780 
know where it is on this model because
I've<00:01:50.579> never<00:01:50.759> checked<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:52.189> but<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> could<00:01:53.610> be

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
I've never checked it but that could be

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.990 
I've never checked it but that could be
another<00:01:54.390> reason<00:01:55.250> now<00:01:56.250> another<00:01:56.490> reason<00:01:56.729> why

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
another reason now another reason why

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
another reason now another reason why
your<00:01:57.180> mower<00:01:57.360> might<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.049> running<00:01:58.380> very

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
your mower might not be running very

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.100 
your mower might not be running very
well<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:59.070> power<00:01:59.520> tool<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> spark

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
well or power tool is that the spark

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.389 
well or power tool is that the spark
plug<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:02.130> dirty<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.530> always<00:02:04.979> good<00:02:05.189> just

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
plug is dirty so it's always good just

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.850 
plug is dirty so it's always good just
to<00:02:05.810> check<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.960> spark<00:02:07.290> plug

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.199 

now<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> an<00:02:11.280> easy<00:02:11.400> thing<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:12.030> you're

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
now this is an easy thing to do you're

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.750 
now this is an easy thing to do you're
just<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> unscrew<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.230> off<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:15.140> just

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
just going to unscrew it off and just

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.300 
just going to unscrew it off and just
check<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.620> it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
check it now this one you can see it's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.199 
check it now this one you can see it's
quite<00:02:20.519> black<00:02:21.739> that's<00:02:22.739> carbon<00:02:23.250> buildup<00:02:23.610> so

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
quite black that's carbon buildup so

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.910 
quite black that's carbon buildup so
I'll<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.540> clean<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.780> I've<00:02:24.989> got<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> wire

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I'll just clean it I've got this wire

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.960 
I'll just clean it I've got this wire
brush<00:02:26.430> thing<00:02:27.019> so<00:02:28.019> I'll<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:29.299> brush<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.569> off

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
brush thing so I'll just brush that off

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.300 
brush thing so I'll just brush that off
bit<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> cleanup<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.110> looks<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.680> lot

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
bit of a cleanup and that looks a lot

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.069 
bit of a cleanup and that looks a lot
better<00:02:35.370> anyway<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.659> might<00:02:36.840> want<00:02:37.049> to

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
better anyway and you might want to

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.979 
better anyway and you might want to
check<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.440> gap<00:02:37.700> there<00:02:38.700> are<00:02:38.790> most<00:02:39.000> gaps<00:02:39.750> are

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
check the gap there are most gaps are

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.910 
check the gap there are most gaps are
about<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> millimeter

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
about a millimeter

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.039 
about a millimeter
I've<00:02:41.099> actually<00:02:41.280> got<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.549> tool<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:42.599> checks<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
I've actually got a tool then checks to

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.580 
I've actually got a tool then checks to
gather<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.140> could<00:02:46.290> be<00:02:46.379> another

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
gather this so that could be another

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.349 
gather this so that could be another
reason<00:02:46.709> why<00:02:47.220> your<00:02:47.400> mower<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:47.879> running<00:02:48.209> too

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
reason why your mower is not running too

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.119 
reason why your mower is not running too
well

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
well

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.520 
well
now<00:02:50.129> especially<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.819> two-stroke<00:02:51.329> motors<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
now especially in two-stroke motors the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.599 
now especially in two-stroke motors the
spark<00:02:52.829> plugs<00:02:53.099> can<00:02:53.489> clog<00:02:53.819> up<00:02:54.060> quite<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> lot<00:02:55.579> no<00:02:56.579> I

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
spark plugs can clog up quite a lot no I

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.039 
spark plugs can clog up quite a lot no I
was<00:02:56.879> having<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.180> lot<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.359> problems<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:57.989> a

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
was having a lot of problems with a

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.759 
was having a lot of problems with a
power<00:02:58.409> tool<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.859> mine<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.489> gave<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.390> me

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
power tool of mine it just gave up on me

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.640 
power tool of mine it just gave up on me
during<00:03:01.769> acceleration<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:03.540> just<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.379> blowing

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
during acceleration it just was blowing

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.819 
during acceleration it just was blowing
a<00:03:04.799> lot<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.980> smoke<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:06.290> really<00:03:07.290> wasn't<00:03:07.620> doing

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
a lot of smoke and really wasn't doing

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.080 
a lot of smoke and really wasn't doing
anything<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.930> reason<00:03:10.379> was<00:03:10.530> because<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
anything and the reason was because the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
anything and the reason was because the
exhaust<00:03:12.480> was<00:03:13.019> blocked

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
exhaust was blocked

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.339 
exhaust was blocked
now<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.609> especially<00:03:15.480> happens<00:03:15.720> in

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
now this especially happens in

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.099 
now this especially happens in
two-stroke<00:03:17.130> motors<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.630> I'll<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.930> show<00:03:19.079> you

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
two-stroke motors and I'll just show you

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.270 
two-stroke motors and I'll just show you
one<00:03:19.410> here<00:03:21.019> now<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.230> here<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.950> exhaust

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
one here now this here is the exhaust

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.629 
one here now this here is the exhaust
system<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.910> one<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.599> my<00:03:24.720> whipper<00:03:24.959> snippers<00:03:25.639> now

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
system of one of my whipper snippers now

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.339 
system of one of my whipper snippers now
how<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.819> found<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.389> it<00:03:27.510> was<00:03:27.540> blocked<00:03:27.870> as<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.139> took

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
how I found out it was blocked as I took

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.220 
how I found out it was blocked as I took
it<00:03:28.470> off<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:29.010> put<00:03:29.819> my<00:03:29.940> mouth<00:03:30.209> over<00:03:30.599> this<00:03:30.720> bit<00:03:31.019> here

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
it off I put my mouth over this bit here

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.270 
it off I put my mouth over this bit here
blue<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:33.510> wasn't<00:03:33.810> blowing<00:03:34.169> through<00:03:34.590> out

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
blue and it wasn't blowing through out

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.309 
blue and it wasn't blowing through out
here<00:03:35.639> at<00:03:35.819> all<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.419> was<00:03:36.540> blocked<00:03:36.840> totally

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
here at all it was blocked totally

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.240 
here at all it was blocked totally
blocked<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.549> what<00:03:39.000> I've<00:03:39.120> done<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:40.349> was

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
blocked so what I've done is I was

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.990 
blocked so what I've done is I was
soaking<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.879> in<00:03:42.150> some<00:03:42.569> kerosene<00:03:43.669> to<00:03:44.669> try<00:03:44.879> and

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
soaking this in some kerosene to try and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.589 
soaking this in some kerosene to try and
get<00:03:45.150> rid<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.329> all<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.780> blockage<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:48.269> let's<00:03:48.449> see

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
get rid of all the blockage so let's see

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.670 
get rid of all the blockage so let's see
how<00:03:48.750> well<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.079> works<00:03:49.109> now

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.839 

well<00:03:52.680> that's<00:03:52.859> blowing<00:03:53.069> through<00:03:53.280> nicely<00:03:53.519> now

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
well that's blowing through nicely now

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.390 
well that's blowing through nicely now
haha<00:03:55.099> hmm<00:03:56.160> kerosene<00:03:57.169> but<00:03:58.169> yeah<00:03:58.440> that's

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
haha hmm kerosene but yeah that's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.670 
haha hmm kerosene but yeah that's
probably<00:03:59.669> just<00:03:59.940> saved<00:04:00.150> me<00:04:00.329> about<00:04:00.540> $50<00:04:01.230> just

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
probably just saved me about $50 just

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.460 
probably just saved me about $50 just
from<00:04:01.859> doing<00:04:02.099> that<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.879> if<00:04:03.599> your<00:04:03.780> tools<00:04:04.019> aren't

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
from doing that so if your tools aren't

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.670 
from doing that so if your tools aren't
running<00:04:04.620> well<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:05.129> two-stroke<00:04:05.959> take<00:04:06.959> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
running well a two-stroke take the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.520 
running well a two-stroke take the
exhaust<00:04:07.980> system<00:04:08.190> off<00:04:08.750> give<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.930> blow<00:04:10.139> if

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
exhaust system off give it a blow if

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.089 
exhaust system off give it a blow if
there's<00:04:11.489> no<00:04:11.730> air<00:04:12.269> blowing<00:04:12.720> through<00:04:13.099> its

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
there's no air blowing through its

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.250 
there's no air blowing through its
blocked<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:15.060> soak<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.419> in<00:04:15.510> some<00:04:15.540> kerosene

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
blocked just soak it in some kerosene

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
blocked just soak it in some kerosene
for<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.829> few<00:04:17.099> days

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
for a few days

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.539 
for a few days
and<00:04:18.260> give<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.410> shake<00:04:19.620> rinse<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.130> out<00:04:20.310> and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
and give it a shake rinse it out and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
excuses you must do this every year and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.850 
excuses you must do this every year and
that<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.190> change<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.540> oil<00:04:33.570> even<00:04:34.440> if<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.650> just

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
that is change the oil even if it's just

that is change the oil even if it's just
once<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.250> year<00:04:35.280> that's<00:04:36.210> fine<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:37.320> should

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
once a year that's fine you should

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.670 
once a year that's fine you should
change<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.979> oil<00:04:38.040> because<00:04:38.729> if<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:39.600> don't<00:04:39.840> it

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
change the oil because if you don't it

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.530 
change the oil because if you don't it

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
will end up like one of my other mowers

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.129 
will end up like one of my other mowers
in<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.350> garage<00:04:43.680> there<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.479> didn't<00:04:45.479> change

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139

the<00:04:46.260> oil<00:04:46.290> on<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.979> it's<00:04:47.280> seized<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.940> that

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
the oil on and it's seized and that

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.870 
the oil on and it's seized and that
model<00:04:48.570> costs<00:04:48.870> $800<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.580> was<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.699> very

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
model costs $800 so that was a very

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.170 
model costs $800 so that was a very
expensive<00:04:51.090> lesson<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.900> learn<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.650> now<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:53.340> try

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
expensive lesson to learn so now I try

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.290 
expensive lesson to learn so now I try
and<00:04:54.240> change<00:04:54.449> my<00:04:54.660> oil<00:04:55.160> regularly<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.520> probably
