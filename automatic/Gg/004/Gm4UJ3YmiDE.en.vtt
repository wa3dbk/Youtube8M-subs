00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.330 
so you can attach it to your belt and
you'll<00:04:26.419> need<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.750> fit<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> 9-volt<00:04:27.620> battery<00:04:28.070> and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
you'll need to fit a 9-volt battery and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.399 
you'll need to fit a 9-volt battery and
on<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> top<00:04:28.909> is<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.180> doll<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.930> can<00:04:30.110> regulate

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
on the top is a doll so you can regulate

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.100

well<00:04:58.390> there<00:04:58.480> are<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.720> few<00:04:58.930> ways<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.170> play<00:04:59.530> with

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
well there are a few ways to play with

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.680 
well there are a few ways to play with
the<00:04:59.800> photon<00:05:00.130> set<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.610> all<00:05:00.760> really<00:05:01.330> require

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
the photon set and all really require

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.510 
the photon set and all really require
two<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.470> make<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.770> most<00:05:02.980> out<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
two of you to make the most out of the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.640 
two of you to make the most out of the
game<00:05:03.730> so<00:05:04.300> we'll<00:05:04.480> start<00:05:04.690> off<00:05:04.900> with<00:05:05.140> some<00:05:05.350> search

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
game so we'll start off with some search

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.470 
game so we'll start off with some search
and<00:05:05.860> disrupt<00:05:06.280> where<00:05:06.550> one<00:05:06.760> player<00:05:06.910> would<00:05:07.240> set

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
and disrupt where one player would set

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.970 
and disrupt where one player would set
up<00:05:07.600> a<00:05:07.720> target<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.350> other<00:05:08.500> one<00:05:08.710> would<00:05:08.860> have

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
up a target and the other one would have

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.830 
up a target and the other one would have
to<00:05:09.040> hit<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.400> target<00:05:09.580> every<00:05:09.940> time<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.630> green

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
to hit the target every time the green

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.380 
to hit the target every time the green
light<00:05:11.050> flashes<00:05:11.530> on<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.100> before<00:05:12.790> it<00:05:12.940> flashes

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
light flashes on and before it flashes

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.510 
light flashes on and before it flashes
off<00:05:13.740> frequency<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.920> green<00:05:15.100> light<00:05:15.280> can<00:05:15.490> be

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
off frequency of the green light can be

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.090 
off frequency of the green light can be
changed<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.330> weird<00:05:16.630> frequent<00:05:17.200> pulse<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.980> as

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
changed for weird frequent pulse to as

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.190 
changed for weird frequent pulse to as
slow<00:05:18.430> as<00:05:18.670> you<00:05:18.760> like<00:05:19.180> which<00:05:19.510> makes<00:05:19.780> for<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.140> very

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
slow as you like which makes for a very

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.680 
slow as you like which makes for a very
entertaining<00:05:20.650> game<00:05:21.370> but<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.150> main<00:05:22.390> feature

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
entertaining game but the main feature

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.960 
entertaining game but the main feature

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.820 
around in the dark or in full daylight
and<00:05:37.180> shoot<00:05:37.510> each<00:05:37.660> other<00:05:37.870> with<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.290> laser<00:05:38.470> guns

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
and shoot each other with the laser guns

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.770 
and shoot each other with the laser guns
until<00:05:39.340> one<00:05:39.520> player<00:05:39.550> has<00:05:40.060> run<00:05:40.300> out<00:05:40.330> of<00:05:40.510> lies

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
until one player has run out of lies

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.080 
until one player has run out of lies
which<00:05:41.290> is<00:05:41.410> always<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:42.070> way<00:05:42.220> I<00:05:42.430> used<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:42.970> play

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
which is always the way I used to play

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.300 
which is always the way I used to play
the<00:05:43.540> phases<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.200> infra<00:05:44.500> red<00:05:44.590> areas<00:05:45.160> are

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
the phases and the infra red areas are

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.310 
the phases and the infra red areas are
extremely<00:05:46.030> responsive<00:05:46.660> which<00:05:46.840> makes<00:05:47.140> for

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
extremely responsive which makes for

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.770 
extremely responsive which makes for
great<00:05:47.560> target<00:05:48.130> practice<00:05:48.580> two<00:05:49.150> helmets<00:05:49.420> and

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
great target practice two helmets and

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.300 
great target practice two helmets and
modules<00:05:50.140> would<00:05:50.290> certainly<00:05:50.680> make<00:05:50.860> this<00:05:51.100> game

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
modules would certainly make this game

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.370 
modules would certainly make this game
more<00:05:51.370> fair<00:05:51.910> as<00:05:52.240> one<00:05:52.480> player<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:52.990> more<00:05:53.230> of<00:05:53.320> a

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
more fair as one player is more of a

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.590 
more fair as one player is more of a
target<00:05:53.620> than<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.190> other<00:05:54.370> this<00:05:54.940> really<00:05:55.360> is<00:05:55.540> a

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
target than the other this really is a

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.300 
target than the other this really is a
blast<00:05:55.990> from<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.230> past<00:05:56.500> for<00:05:56.830> me<00:05:56.950> and<00:05:57.190> it

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
blast from the past for me and it

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.880 
blast from the past for me and it
certainly<00:05:57.730> is<00:05:58.360> extremely<00:05:59.350> good<00:05:59.890> fun<00:06:01.890> well

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
certainly is extremely good fun well

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.770 
certainly is extremely good fun well
this<00:06:03.010> really<00:06:03.280> was<00:06:03.610> something<00:06:03.970> very<00:06:04.420> special

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780
