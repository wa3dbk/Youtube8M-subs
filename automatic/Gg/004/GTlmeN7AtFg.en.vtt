exactly<00:01:17.130> who<00:01:17.520> Doctor<00:01:18.030> Doom<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.990> he's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
exactly who Doctor Doom was or what he's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
exactly who Doctor Doom was or what he's
supposed<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> look<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.740> which<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.430> was

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
supposed to look like which you know was

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
supposed to look like which you know was
totally<00:01:21.240> intentional<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.900> their<00:01:22.080> part<00:01:22.380> which

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
totally intentional on their part which

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.070 
totally intentional on their part which
is<00:01:22.530> fine<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.540> snippet<00:01:24.810> right

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
is fine but I think this snippet right

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.929 
is fine but I think this snippet right
over<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.890> Doctor<00:01:26.430> Doom<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
over here I think that's Doctor Doom you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
over here I think that's Doctor Doom you
know<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.299> making<00:01:27.509> guns<00:01:28.020> explode<00:01:28.650> or

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.170 
know what I mean making guns explode or
whatever<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.369> far<00:01:29.579> away<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.729> looks<00:01:29.850> seems

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
whatever from far away it looks seems

Torch

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
Torch
that<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.200> would<00:01:40.350> expect<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that we would expect because we have a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
that we would expect because we have a
white<00:01:42.150> suit<00:01:42.509> storm<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.350> stormo's<00:01:43.770> block

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
white suit storm now so stormo's block

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.280 
white suit storm now so stormo's block
and<00:01:44.460> Human<00:01:44.729> Torch<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.000> black<00:01:45.329> there'd<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and Human Torch was black there'd be a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.870 
and Human Torch was black there'd be a
lot<00:01:46.470> easier<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.920> wrap<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.250> head<00:01:47.430> around<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
lot easier to wrap my head around it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.010 
lot easier to wrap my head around it
because<00:01:48.149> they're<00:01:48.270> supposed<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.780> siblings

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
because they're supposed to be siblings

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.840 
because they're supposed to be siblings
the<00:01:49.799> only<00:01:50.070> thing<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.610> where<00:01:50.729> they're

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the only thing I can see where they're

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.870 
the only thing I can see where they're
going<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.479> their<00:01:51.689> adopted<00:01:52.619> kids<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.790> if

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
going this is their adopted kids so if

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
going this is their adopted kids so if
they're<00:01:54.060> adopted<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:55.200> fine<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.799> but

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
they're adopted I'm fine with that but

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.800 
they're adopted I'm fine with that but
the<00:01:56.700> big<00:01:56.850> problem<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.210> me<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.600> they're

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the big problem for me is that they're

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.240 
the big problem for me is that they're
supposed<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.200> brother<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.530> sister<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.040> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
supposed to be brother and sister so I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
supposed to be brother and sister so I
hope<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.909> make<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.240> brother<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
hope that they make them brother and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.429 
hope that they make them brother and
sister

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
sister

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
sister

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
somehow because that's one thing I

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.850 
somehow because that's one thing I
really<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.570> Fantastic<00:02:04.290> Four<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> that

trailer I think this could be a good
movie<00:03:51.540> don't<00:03:51.840> think<00:03:52.139> I'm<00:03:52.260> gonna<00:03:52.379> hate<00:03:52.680> it

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859

movie don't think I'm gonna hate it
because<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.400> far<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.790> looks<00:03:53.819> like<00:03:54.150> Fox<00:03:54.569> is

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
because so far it looks like Fox is

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.659 
because so far it looks like Fox is
taking<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.229> seriously<00:03:55.829> then<00:03:56.250> they're<00:03:56.489> going

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
taking it seriously then they're going

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.119 
taking it seriously then they're going
bit<00:03:56.940> dramatic<00:03:57.510> with<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.900> but<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:58.769> showed<00:03:59.010> us

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
bit dramatic with it but they showed us

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.159 
bit dramatic with it but they showed us
some<00:03:59.340> cool<00:03:59.579> effects<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.269> everything<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:00.930> I

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
don't know it's a toss-up but it does

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.280 
don't know it's a toss-up but it does
look<00:04:02.819> like<00:04:02.879> Fox<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.389> taking<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.870> seriously<00:04:04.199> and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
look like Fox is taking it seriously and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.050
