that's<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.469> excalibur<00:00:47.780> food<00:00:48.780> dehydrator

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that's the excalibur food dehydrator

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
that's the excalibur food dehydrator
it's<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.100> ninth<00:00:50.399> ray<00:00:52.010> dehydrator<00:00:53.329> right<00:00:54.329> next

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it's a ninth ray dehydrator right next

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
it's a ninth ray dehydrator right next
to<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> settings<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> temperature

get this is to lift this at the bottom
and<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.790> top<00:02:00.820> opens<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:05.429> as<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.610> can<00:02:06.789> see

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
and the top opens now as you can see

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.740 
and the top opens now as you can see
there<00:02:07.210> are<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.869> is<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.019> 93<00:02:08.619> dehydrator<00:02:09.750> 93

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
there are this is a 93 dehydrator 93

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.140 
there are this is a 93 dehydrator 93
dehydrators<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.739> this<00:02:12.100> up<00:02:12.400> nine<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.940> these

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
dehydrators so this up nine of these

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.320 
dehydrators so this up nine of these
here<00:02:13.769> see<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:14.950> trace<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.750> comes<00:02:17.200> off

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
here see this trace this comes off

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.130 
here see this trace this comes off
underneath<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:20.400> thing<00:02:21.400> there<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.870> I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
underneath is this thing there but I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.680 
underneath is this thing there but I
removed<00:02:23.560> some<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.030> there<00:02:28.450> will<00:02:28.510> be

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
removed some of it so that there will be

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.229 
removed some of it so that there will be
more<00:02:28.930> air<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:31.260> dehydrating<00:02:32.580> because<00:02:33.580> there's

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
more air for dehydrating because there's

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.729 
more air for dehydrating because there's
not<00:02:34.450> much<00:02:34.840> food<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> dehydrate<00:02:36.730> right<00:02:37.030> now

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
not much food to dehydrate right now

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.759 
not much food to dehydrate right now
that's<00:02:38.739> my<00:02:39.070> bit<00:02:39.400> burger<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.630> woke<00:02:41.380> up<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
that's my bit burger on woke up that

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.490 
that's my bit burger on woke up that
later<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> deflection<00:02:43.930> sheet

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
later and this is the deflection sheet

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.600 
later and this is the deflection sheet
that<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.100> normally<00:02:45.549> hear<00:02:46.269> about<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:48.370> that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
that you normally hear about see that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.080 
that you normally hear about see that
underneath<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.570> up<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.019> that's<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.530> side<00:02:51.220> you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
underneath is up and that's the side you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.140 
underneath is up and that's the side you
wanna<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.530> wanna<00:02:54.720> dehydrate<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.140> them

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
wanna you wanna dehydrate on in them

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.830 
wanna you wanna dehydrate on in them
it's<00:02:58.150> nonstick<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.510> flip<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:03.510> after<00:03:04.510> so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
it's nonstick so you flip that after so

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.490 
it's nonstick so you flip that after so
many<00:03:04.989> hours<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.890> hydrating<00:03:07.350> ok<00:03:08.350> cool

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
many hours of the hydrating ok cool

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.390 
many hours of the hydrating ok cool
that's<00:03:11.500> your<00:03:11.829> dehydrator<00:03:12.070> there<00:03:13.000> right
