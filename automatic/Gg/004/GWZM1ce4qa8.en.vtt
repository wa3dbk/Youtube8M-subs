the<00:00:34.980> Dark<00:00:35.219> Ages<00:00:35.460> Mittman<00:00:36.059> either<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> in

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the Dark Ages Mittman either way is in

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.220 
the Dark Ages Mittman either way is in
Norway<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> historically

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
Norway but it's not a historically

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
Norway but it's not a historically
factual<00:00:40.230> story<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.980> therefore<00:00:41.399> oh<00:00:41.579> classes<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
factual story so therefore oh classes a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.310 
factual story so therefore oh classes a
fancy<00:00:43.020> oracle<00:00:43.800> anyway<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.870> takes<00:00:46.140> place

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
fancy oracle anyway so this takes place

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
fancy oracle anyway so this takes place
around<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.370> time<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> Black<00:00:47.969> Death<00:00:48.210> and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.310 
to be some kind of loyalty at beginning
and<00:03:27.090> that's<00:03:27.240> why<00:03:27.450> they're<00:03:27.660> following<00:03:27.959> we're

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
and that's why they're following we're

and that's why they're following we're
following<00:03:28.500> her<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:29.130> no<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:30.000> not<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.209> case
