even<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.139> swingarm<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.869> did<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.139> find<00:02:03.350> time

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
even the swingarm so did you find time

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.449 
even the swingarm so did you find time
to<00:02:03.740> ride<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:05.170> little<00:02:06.170> bit<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.590> far<00:02:06.859> yeah<00:02:07.189> I

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
to ride it a little bit so far yeah I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.979 
to ride it a little bit so far yeah I
liked<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:07.999> a<00:02:08.060> lot<00:02:08.209> actually<00:02:08.450> have<00:02:08.720> ridden

liked it a lot actually have ridden

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.429 
liked it a lot actually have ridden
sport<00:02:09.349> bikes<00:02:09.560> before<00:02:09.799> that<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.280> find<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.909> be<00:02:11.439> too

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
sport bikes before that I find to be too

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.930 
sport bikes before that I find to be too
powerful<00:02:13.010> for<00:02:13.040> riding<00:02:13.670> a

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
powerful for riding a

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.280 
powerful for riding a
on<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.240> street<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.630> they're<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:14.960> there

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
on the street and they're just there

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.050 
on the street and they're just there
they're<00:02:15.740> frightening<00:02:16.220> they're<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.610> powerful

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
they're frightening they're so powerful

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.020 
they're frightening they're so powerful
and<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.540> one<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.350> strong<00:02:19.340> fast<00:02:19.640> bike

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and this one is is a strong fast bike

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.110 
and this one is is a strong fast bike
yep<00:02:20.570> but<00:02:21.350> because<00:02:21.710> it's<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.920> v-twin<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.550> seems<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
yep but because it's a v-twin it seems a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.900 
yep but because it's a v-twin it seems a
little<00:02:23.240> more<00:02:23.390> friendly<00:02:24.130> yep<00:02:25.130> still<00:02:25.640> fast

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
little more friendly yep still fast

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.560 
little more friendly yep still fast

to use and you don't have to be revving

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.670 
to use and you don't have to be revving
the<00:02:32.330> snot<00:02:32.570> out<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.050> have<00:02:33.170> fun<00:02:33.440> right

highway<00:02:40.550> ride<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.090> get<00:02:41.240> here<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.660> thought

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
highway ride to get here and I thought

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.930 
highway ride to get here and I thought
that<00:02:42.260> my<00:02:42.560> hands<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.040> feet<00:02:43.190> would<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.400> numb<00:02:43.700> by

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
that my hands and feet would be numb by

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.220 
that my hands and feet would be numb by
the<00:02:44.030> time<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.300> got<00:02:44.510> here<00:02:44.720> there<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.050> little

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
the time I got here there is a little

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.800 
the time I got here there is a little
bit<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.620> vibration<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:47.570> it's<00:02:47.720> a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
bit of a vibration but because it's a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.310 
bit of a vibration but because it's a
v-twin<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.350> vibrations<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.370> slower<00:02:50.320> frequency

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
v-twin the vibrations a slower frequency

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.510 
v-twin the vibrations a slower frequency
mm-hmm<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:53.180> actually<00:02:53.390> fine<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.520> the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
mm-hmm and it's actually fine so the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.790 
mm-hmm and it's actually fine so the
motor<00:02:55.760> although<00:02:56.210> it's<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.720> twin<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.590> not

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
motor although it's a twin and not

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.070 
motor although it's a twin and not
seemingly<00:02:58.640> as<00:02:58.880> smooth<00:02:59.240> as<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> fourth<00:02:59.840> dollar

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
seemingly as smooth as a fourth dollar

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.810 
seemingly as smooth as a fourth dollar
it's<00:03:00.440> actually<00:03:00.800> as<00:03:00.890> smooth<00:03:01.100> as<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.430> needs<00:03:01.610> to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
it's actually as smooth as it needs to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.420 
it's actually as smooth as it needs to
be<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:03.170> found<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> bike<00:03:04.250> really

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
be and I found the bike really

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.630 
be and I found the bike really
comfortable<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.180> highway<00:03:05.510> yeah<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.860> bars

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
comfortable in the highway yeah the bars

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.820 
comfortable in the highway yeah the bars
are<00:03:07.880> at<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:08.330> height<00:03:08.600> for<00:03:09.080> taking<00:03:09.710> on

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
are at the right height for taking on

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.710 
are at the right height for taking on
wind<00:03:10.130> at<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> hundred<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.970> twenty<00:03:11.270> kilometres

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
wind at a hundred and twenty kilometres

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.660 
wind at a hundred and twenty kilometres
an<00:03:11.840> hour<00:03:11.930> or<00:03:12.170> whatever<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.650> were<00:03:12.800> riding<00:03:13.310> at

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
an hour or whatever we were riding at

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.690 
an hour or whatever we were riding at
and<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.440> wind<00:03:15.620> holds<00:03:16.010> your<00:03:16.100> head<00:03:16.280> up<00:03:16.490> in

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
and so the wind holds your head up in

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.180 
and so the wind holds your head up in
your<00:03:16.820> upper<00:03:17.060> torso<00:03:17.270> with<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:18.560> enough<00:03:18.890> that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
your upper torso with just enough that

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.500 
your upper torso with just enough that
you<00:03:19.310> don't<00:03:19.459> have<00:03:19.610> too<00:03:19.760> much<00:03:19.880> weight<00:03:20.150> on<00:03:20.330> your

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
you don't have too much weight on your

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.500 
you don't have too much weight on your
hands<00:03:20.930> yeah<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:22.280> seat<00:03:22.490> is<00:03:22.640> really<00:03:22.850> wide<00:03:23.180> and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
hands yeah the seat is really wide and

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.590 
hands yeah the seat is really wide and
flat<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:24.770> it's<00:03:25.430> not<00:03:25.670> cush<00:03:26.000> or<00:03:26.180> anything<00:03:26.360> but

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
flat it's it's not cush or anything but

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.320 
flat it's it's not cush or anything but
I<00:03:26.660> didn't<00:03:27.560> get<00:03:27.620> an<00:03:27.770> uncomfortable<00:03:28.490> but<00:03:28.910> during

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
I didn't get an uncomfortable but during

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.110 
I didn't get an uncomfortable but during
the<00:03:29.450> ride<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:30.320> was<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:31.070> was<00:03:31.250> surprisingly<00:03:31.820> good

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the ride it was it was surprisingly good

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.030 
the ride it was it was surprisingly good
yeah<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.870> I've<00:03:32.930> ridden<00:03:33.170> sport<00:03:33.530> bikes<00:03:33.740> where

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
yeah and I've ridden sport bikes where

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.380 
yeah and I've ridden sport bikes where
you<00:03:34.400> couldn't<00:03:34.760> say<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:34.910> where<00:03:35.240> you<00:03:35.360> are

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
you couldn't say that where you are

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.270 
you couldn't say that where you are
folded<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.050> half<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.500> I'm<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.830> little<00:03:37.100> too<00:03:37.250> old

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
folded in half and I'm a little too old

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.940 
folded in half and I'm a little too old
to<00:03:37.550> be<00:03:37.700> doing<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:39.050> now<00:03:39.260> even<00:03:39.590> though<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.680> still

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
to be doing that now even though I still

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.670 
to be doing that now even though I still
will<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.700> has<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> lot<00:03:41.300> of<00:03:41.330> power<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.170> doesn't

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
will it has a lot of power it doesn't

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.170 
will it has a lot of power it doesn't
sound<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.550> first<00:03:43.700> thing<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.120> think

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
sound like it the first thing I think

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.240 
sound like it the first thing I think
I'd<00:03:44.450> change<00:03:44.750> would<00:03:44.930> be<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.080> exhaust<00:03:45.530> mm-hmm

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
I'd change would be the exhaust mm-hmm

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.460 
I'd change would be the exhaust mm-hmm
and<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.030> doesn't<00:03:47.330> start<00:03:47.540> really<00:03:47.840> making<00:03:47.989> noise

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and it doesn't start really making noise

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.400 
and it doesn't start really making noise
until

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
until

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.630 
until
it's<00:03:51.410> pretty<00:03:51.710> close<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.190> end<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.490> its

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
it's pretty close to the end of its

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.110 
it's pretty close to the end of its
usable<00:03:53.540> range<00:03:54.110> yeah<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.980> that's<00:03:55.790> when<00:03:56.000> it

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
usable range yeah and that's when it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.750 
usable range yeah and that's when it
starts<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.480> sound<00:03:56.690> good<00:03:56.990> yeah<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:58.580> it's<00:03:58.700> a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
starts to sound good yeah but it's a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.130 
starts to sound good yeah but it's a
modern<00:03:59.000> bike<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.360> has<00:03:59.510> two<00:03:59.720> catalytic

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
mukaddes always been known to have the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.720 
mukaddes always been known to have the
big<00:04:07.820> Brembo<00:04:08.270> brakes<00:04:08.950> stopping<00:04:09.950> power<00:04:10.100> that's

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
big Brembo brakes stopping power that's

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.490 
big Brembo brakes stopping power that's
the<00:04:11.030> biggest<00:04:11.210> deal<00:04:11.480> about<00:04:11.690> this<00:04:11.990> bike<00:04:12.230> and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
the biggest deal about this bike and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.590 
the biggest deal about this bike and
I've<00:04:12.860> really<00:04:13.220> explored<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.970> limits<00:04:14.510> of

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
I've really explored the limits of

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.420 
I've really explored the limits of
handling<00:04:15.110> because<00:04:15.320> we're<00:04:15.500> street<00:04:15.920> riding<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
handling because we're street riding so

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.830 
handling because we're street riding so
I<00:04:16.459> haven't<00:04:16.910> leaned<00:04:17.180> all<00:04:17.360> the<00:04:17.450> way<00:04:17.570> over<00:04:17.810> but

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
I haven't leaned all the way over but

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.050 
I haven't leaned all the way over but
the<00:04:18.080> brakes<00:04:18.320> are<00:04:18.940> awesome

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
and I'd rather have big brakes than a

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.780 
and I'd rather have big brakes than a
big<00:04:22.820> motor<00:04:23.150> yep<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.320> gauges<00:04:24.530> are<00:04:25.220> cool<00:04:25.520> and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
there's a couple of electronic bits you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.400 
there's a couple of electronic bits you
can<00:04:27.920> cycle<00:04:28.160> through<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:29.050> pick<00:04:30.050> up<00:04:30.230> oil

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
can cycle through to pick up oil

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.950 
can cycle through to pick up oil
temperature<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.400> water<00:04:32.180> temperature<00:04:32.780> and

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
quarter-mile time is it's it's a really

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.439 
and I think the market for this bike are
people<00:05:59.180> like<00:05:59.419> me<00:05:59.690> who<00:06:00.759> want<00:06:01.759> a<00:06:01.880> special<00:06:02.270> bike

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:05.950 
yeah and we'll pay a little extra for it
although<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.240> don't<00:06:05.360> think<00:06:05.479> they're<00:06:05.720> really

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
although I don't think they're really

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.170 
although I don't think they're really
that<00:06:06.080> expensive<00:06:06.349> compared<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.070> a<00:06:07.099> Ferrari<00:06:07.400> no

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
that expensive compared to a Ferrari no

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.659 
that expensive compared to a Ferrari no
it's<00:06:08.479> a<00:06:08.539> little<00:06:08.630> bit<00:06:08.780> cheaper<00:06:08.990> than<00:06:09.139> a<00:06:09.289> Ferrari

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
it's a little bit cheaper than a Ferrari

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.189 
it's a little bit cheaper than a Ferrari
