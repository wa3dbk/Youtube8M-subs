today's<00:00:24.250> lesson<00:00:24.550> is<00:00:24.940> about<00:00:26.610> making<00:00:27.610> takes

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
today's lesson is about making takes

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.779 
today's lesson is about making takes
we'll<00:00:28.060> take<00:00:28.270> a<00:00:28.300> building<00:00:28.660> blocks<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:30.490> these

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
we'll take a building blocks with these

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.080 
we'll take a building blocks with these
building<00:00:31.119> blocks<00:00:31.150> we're<00:00:31.510> going<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.840> make

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
building blocks we're going to make

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
building blocks we're going to make
cubes<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.899> make<00:00:35.220> stellated<00:00:36.220> octahedron<00:00:39.150> make

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
cubes to make stellated octahedron make

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.610 
cubes to make stellated octahedron make
tetrahedron

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
tetrahedron

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.830 
tetrahedron
first<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:44.829> need<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:45.280> perfectly<00:00:46.239> square<00:00:46.300> sheet

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
first you need a perfectly square sheet

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.610 
first you need a perfectly square sheet
of<00:00:46.899> paper<00:00:49.320> okay

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
of paper okay

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.410 
of paper okay
this<00:00:50.890> one's<00:00:51.100> not<00:00:51.220> square<00:00:51.520> but<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.059> remember

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
this one's not square but I remember

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.600 
this one's not square but I remember
hearing<00:00:53.230> something<00:00:53.410> about<00:00:53.649> if<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.220> fold<00:00:54.460> it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
hearing something about if you fold it

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.729 
hearing something about if you fold it
in<00:00:54.700> half<00:00:54.730> just<00:00:54.940> right<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:56.140> get<00:00:56.290> a<00:00:56.320> square

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
in half just right you get a square

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.120 
in half just right you get a square
piece<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.010> paper<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:57.760> I'm<00:00:58.149> going<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.329> go<00:00:58.480> out

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
piece of paper so I'm going to go out

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.319 
piece of paper so I'm going to go out
fold<00:01:00.130> it<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.430> half<00:01:02.309> too<00:01:03.309> many<00:01:03.640> threads<00:01:03.850> bending

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
fold it in half too many threads bending

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:10.730 
fold it in half too many threads bending
it<00:01:04.420> back<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.809> forth<00:01:05.019> a<00:01:05.110> few<00:01:05.140> times<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:08.219> then

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it back and forth a few times and then

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.639 
it back and forth a few times and then
we'll<00:01:11.740> gently<00:01:13.350> pull<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:16.319> happen<00:01:17.319> now<00:01:17.439> as<00:01:17.530> you

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
we'll gently pull it happen now as you

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.519 
we'll gently pull it happen now as you
can<00:01:17.829> see<00:01:18.039> I<00:01:18.280> have<00:01:18.700> two<00:01:18.909> perfectly<00:01:19.779> square

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:20.529 
can see I have two perfectly square

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:25.120 
can see I have two perfectly square
sheets<00:01:20.979> of<00:01:21.159> paper

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.560 

still<00:01:25.549> all<00:01:25.670> right<00:01:27.490> okay<00:01:28.520> wait<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.180> remember<00:01:29.479> it

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
to fold a right triangle

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.770 
to fold a right triangle
invented<00:01:34.610> by<00:01:34.640> or<00:01:34.880> little<00:01:35.240> over<00:01:35.420> right<00:01:35.630> now

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.080 

ght<00:01:44.299> now<00:01:45.369> any<00:01:46.369> time<00:01:46.729> you're<00:01:46.909> building

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
ght now any time you're building

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.240 
ght now any time you're building
something<00:01:47.509> craftsmanship<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.500> essential<00:01:49.009> you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
something craftsmanship is essential you

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.559 
something craftsmanship is essential you
don't<00:01:49.460> want<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.700> do<00:01:49.789> shoddy<00:01:50.060> work<00:01:50.299> especially

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
don't want to do shoddy work especially

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:51.999 
don't want to do shoddy work especially
in<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.049> very<00:01:51.229> beginning<00:01:51.409> of<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.799> project

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
in the very beginning of the project

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.669 
in the very beginning of the project
because<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.149> problem<00:01:53.569> is<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.229> want<00:01:54.560> to

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
because the problem is I just want to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.449 
because the problem is I just want to
continue<00:01:56.170> okay<00:01:57.170> there's<00:01:57.349> my<00:01:57.500> right<00:01:57.740> triangle

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
continue okay there's my right triangle

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.580 
continue okay there's my right triangle
I<00:01:58.490> need<00:01:59.209> to<00:01:59.330> get<00:01:59.420> rid<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.689> this<00:01:59.990> part<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.470> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
I need to get rid of this part of the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.270 
I need to get rid of this part of the
rectangle<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:01.250> I'm<00:02:01.399> going<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.580> fold<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:01.909> over

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
rectangle so I'm going to fold that over

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.880 
rectangle so I'm going to fold that over
you<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.490> cut<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.789> with<00:02:05.000> scissors<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:06.560> can
