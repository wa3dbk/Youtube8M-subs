00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470

really<00:02:39.739> cool<00:02:39.980> under<00:02:40.370> eyes<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.000> think<00:02:41.060> that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
really cool under eyes and I think that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.180 
really cool under eyes and I think that
Treyarch<00:02:41.840> should<00:02:42.020> implement<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.739> just<00:02:42.950> maybe

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
Treyarch should implement it just maybe

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.620 
Treyarch should implement it just maybe
not<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> leaderboard<00:02:44.000> or<00:02:44.330> something
