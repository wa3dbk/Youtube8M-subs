00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.710
 Málaga won by 2 goals to 0 in 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.719
 the rose garden to the cordoba in the duel of the 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.230
 twenty-seventh day of the bbva league 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.910
 a triumph that keeps málaga in the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.800
 seventh place in the ranking and one 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.550
 defeat that leaves the cordoba in a 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.370
 truly compromised situation 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.220
 continue as a player with 18 points and 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.030
 Chaining eight consecutive defeats and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.030
 nine days without winning 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.390
 first opportunity of the meeting of the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.790
 málaga that was the great dominator of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.180
 match 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.010
 the center of samuel and at auction 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.080
 juanmi that blocked mikel satir 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.380
 the córdoba came out as an alignment a 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.980
 so strange 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.210
 the córdoba practically repeating eleven 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.520
 initial a cordoba that came from losing 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.310
 nice partnership for that shot of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.579
 roberto rosales 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.309
 the high shot of rose bushes 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.350
 there they see the good wall with the return 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 of samuel heel 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.720
 more the málaga in that opening that was going to 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.579
 end the opportunity of arthur boka 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.610
 the shot against the post but look 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.920
 that in the rejection was going to arm the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.930
 kickback miroslav djukic team 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.490
 that he was going to have his best 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.280
 opportunity of virtually all 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.500
 match the acceleration of bb the center 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.380
 for David rows and Carlos Kameni avoided 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.620
 the team goal blanquiverde all the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.020
 world congratulated Kameni conscious of 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.640
 that the Cameroonian goalkeeper had just 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 save your team's neck 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.150
 and free direct from inside the area 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.210
 for Malaga the center of artur mouth and 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.210
 samuel's auction too high 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.270
 I regretted the missed opportunity 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.350
 the number 7 of the malacitano team 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.500
 Second time images 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.240
 where the málaga was going to get the two 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.590
 goals of victory this is the play to 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.180
 the city of the first goal 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.540
 samu castillejo for juan and that 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.810
 it ended that way 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.430
 a goal of Juan and although the repetition 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.330
 to be able to check like the forward 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.530
 del malaga was on offside 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.000
 the existence of castillejo spoon 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.300
 sensational and the completion of juanmi 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.300
 changes 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.710
 from another point of view according to 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.620
 replica of the córdoba was going to arrive in this 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.800
 action and will move the leather very well on 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.290
 team of djukic creed topped it seemed 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.090
 he was going to score but walton avoided the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.090
 goal practically under sticks 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.290
 but it was the intervention of the defense 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.290
 central and captain of málaga 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.579
 despite the arrival of the córdoba and the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.790
 Malaga who had the ball and who 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.590
 it came more clearly 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.489
 there he was going to claim a possible 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.010
 penalty aborts a penalty that you did not see and 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.650
 who indicated it by nancy 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.329
 that there you can see the vice launch 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.799
 between horta and fausto rossi the Italian 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.799
 wants to enter the second half 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.689
 recovery by málaga and 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.079
 see the shot of ricardo orca against 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.079
 the crossbar 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.450
 the málaga that was looking for the second goal 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.610
 the goal to sentence to finalize 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.070
 the match 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.420
 and at the end in the final stretch of 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.470
 encounter I was going to find the reward 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.160
 the team of javi gracia 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.770
 nordin amrabat protection and shooting at 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.270
 short stick to beat mikel satirize in 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.430
 2 to 0 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.100
 rabat that had already marked the cordoba 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.050
 in the victory of málaga in the archangel 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.350
 in the duel corresponding to the first 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.350
 return 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.980
 and Malaga 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.959
 that could mark one more however 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.500
 Luis Alberto thinks he took advantage of that 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.500
 opportunity 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.650
 at the end and the rose triumph of 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.009
 Malaga before the Córdoba Málaga 2 Córdoba 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.009
 0
