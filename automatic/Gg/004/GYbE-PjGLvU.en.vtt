thousand coins he's going to cost at the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.170 
thousand coins he's going to cost at the
moment<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:11.040> soon<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.850> me<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> air

moment so as soon as like to me the air

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.540 
moment so as soon as like to me the air
drops<00:03:12.450> tomorrow<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.470> everybody<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.160> impacts

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
drops tomorrow and everybody is impacts

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.220 
drops tomorrow and everybody is impacts
they<00:03:15.090> brought<00:03:15.480> Royce<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.870> going<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.200> down

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
they brought Royce is going to go down

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.680 
they brought Royce is going to go down
like<00:03:16.440> even<00:03:16.920> more<00:03:17.070> like<00:03:17.280> 10<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.730> 15<00:03:18.030> km<00:03:18.360> or<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.510> can

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
like even more like 10 to 15 km or I can

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.840 
like even more like 10 to 15 km or I can
imagine<00:03:18.900> maybe<00:03:19.590> even<00:03:19.860> more<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.640> know<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.820> just

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
imagine maybe even more you know it just

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.790 
imagine maybe even more you know it just
depends<00:03:21.420> how<00:03:21.540> many<00:03:21.600> people<00:03:22.080> pull<00:03:22.260> Royce<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
depends how many people pull Royce and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.140 
depends how many people pull Royce and
the<00:03:23.190> fact<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.430> they<00:03:23.580> want<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.880> sell<00:03:24.030> in

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the fact that they want to sell in

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.820 
the fact that they want to sell in
quickly<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.900> keep<00:03:25.050> open<00:03:25.320> impact<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
quickly and just keep open impact so

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.980 
quickly and just keep open impact so
that<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.520> main<00:03:27.000> reason<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.390> players<00:03:27.840> go

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
that is the main reason that players go

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.320 
that is the main reason that players go
down<00:03:28.200> but<00:03:28.410> Marco<00:03:29.250> rushes<00:03:29.550> at<00:03:29.700> 60<00:03:30.030> k<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.270> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
down but Marco rushes at 60 k at the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.670 
down but Marco rushes at 60 k at the
moment<00:03:30.660> he'll<00:03:30.810> probably<00:03:31.080> go<00:03:31.290> down<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.530> about

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
moment he'll probably go down to about

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.760 
moment he'll probably go down to about
45<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.640> 50<00:03:33.030> k<00:03:33.240> tomorrow<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.900> imagine<00:03:34.110> and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
45 to 50 k tomorrow I can imagine and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.170 
45 to 50 k tomorrow I can imagine and
then<00:03:34.890> after<00:03:35.280> team<00:03:35.460> of<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.640> air<00:03:35.730> packs<00:03:35.970> are

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
then after team of the air packs are

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.270 
then after team of the air packs are
pretty<00:03:36.450> much<00:03:36.540> done<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.710> whole<00:03:37.860> hype<00:03:38.100> is

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
pretty much done and the whole hype is

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.250 
pretty much done and the whole hype is
over<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.880> imagine<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.840> market<00:03:40.200> will

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
over I can imagine that the market will

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.620 
over I can imagine that the market will
stabilize<00:03:40.830> Royce<00:03:41.430> will<00:03:41.760> probably<00:03:42.150> go<00:03:42.300> back<00:03:42.480> up

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
stabilize Royce will probably go back up

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.860 
stabilize Royce will probably go back up
to<00:03:42.750> about<00:03:42.930> 80<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.560> 100<00:03:43.980> k<00:03:44.130> within<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.510> month

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
to about 80 to 100 k within like a month

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.750 
to about 80 to 100 k within like a month
or<00:03:46.170> two<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.890> going<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.100> take<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> while<00:03:47.430> to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
or two it's going to take a while to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.610 
or two it's going to take a while to
sort<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.510> balance<00:03:48.780> going<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
sort of get the balance going and the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.440 
sort of get the balance going and the
price<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.220> sort<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.490> start<00:03:50.790> going<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.330> as

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
price is to sort of start going to as

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.600 
price is to sort of start going to as
they<00:03:51.630> were<00:03:51.690> like<00:03:52.410> Balotelli<00:03:52.920> costing<00:03:53.400> like

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
they were like Balotelli costing like

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.150 
they were like Balotelli costing like
20k<00:03:54.000> awesome<00:03:54.360> for<00:03:54.510> now<00:03:54.660> he's<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:54.930> 8k<00:03:55.290> or<00:03:55.740> 6k

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
20k awesome for now he's like 8k or 6k

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.070 
20k awesome for now he's like 8k or 6k
very<00:03:56.850> very<00:03:57.030> few<00:03:57.240> players<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.780> think<00:03:57.810> they

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
very very few players and I think they

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.300 
very very few players and I think they
will<00:03:58.230> start<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.500> return<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.040> their<00:03:59.160> normal

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
will start to return to their normal

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.280 
will start to return to their normal
prices<00:03:59.850> but<00:04:00.240> I<00:04:00.300> don't<00:04:00.600> think<00:04:00.780> they<00:04:00.900> will<00:04:01.080> go<00:04:01.260> to

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
prices but I don't think they will go to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.380 
prices but I don't think they will go to
exactly<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.100> normal<00:04:02.580> prices<00:04:02.910> say<00:04:03.060> like<00:04:03.210> Royce

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
exactly the normal prices say like Royce

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.590 
exactly the normal prices say like Royce
was<00:04:03.630> 120<00:04:04.320> k<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.710> don't<00:04:05.280> think<00:04:05.550> he'll<00:04:05.820> stay<00:04:06.180> I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
was 120 k I don't think he'll stay I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.540 
was 120 k I don't think he'll stay I
don't<00:04:07.050> think<00:04:07.080> you'll<00:04:07.290> go<00:04:07.440> back<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:07.710> to<00:04:07.800> 120<00:04:08.400> k<00:04:08.520> I

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
don't think you'll go back up to 120 k I

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.850 
don't think you'll go back up to 120 k I
think<00:04:08.790> he'll<00:04:08.910> settle<00:04:09.150> for<00:04:09.450> around<00:04:09.660> 90<00:04:10.110> or<00:04:10.350> 80

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
think he'll settle for around 90 or 80

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.190 
think he'll settle for around 90 or 80
or<00:04:11.100> 90<00:04:11.310> k<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:11.850> what<00:04:12.090> my<00:04:12.270> prediction<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:12.990> so

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
or 90 k that is what my prediction is so

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.750 
or 90 k that is what my prediction is so
hopefully<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.070> know<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.220> could<00:04:14.370> come<00:04:14.520> back<00:04:14.640> to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
hopefully you know I could come back to

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.220 
hopefully you know I could come back to
this<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.060> couple<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.450> weeks<00:04:15.510> or<00:04:15.900> maybe<00:04:16.080> even

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
this in a couple of weeks or maybe even

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.110 
this in a couple of weeks or maybe even
months<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.770> i'll<00:04:16.890> see<00:04:17.100> if<00:04:17.340> my<00:04:17.549> prediction<00:04:18.000> was

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
months and i'll see if my prediction was

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.760 
months and i'll see if my prediction was
right<00:04:18.330> but<00:04:18.810> i'm<00:04:18.900> pretty<00:04:19.140> sure<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.650> what

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
right but i'm pretty sure that is what

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.870 
right but i'm pretty sure that is what
it's<00:04:19.890> going<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.040> happen<00:04:20.190> because<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.640> just

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
it's going to happen because it just

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880 
it's going to happen because it just
never<00:04:21.120> seems<00:04:21.420> to<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.660> back<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.049> how<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.169> was<00:04:22.290> it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
never seems to go back to how it was it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.500 
never seems to go back to how it was it
seems<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> little<00:04:23.700> bit<00:04:23.940> cheaper<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.390> it's

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
seems to go a little bit cheaper so it's

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.870 
seems to go a little bit cheaper so it's
pretty<00:04:24.630> cool<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.140> obviously<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.919> can<00:04:26.130> get

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
pretty cool and obviously you can get

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.090 
pretty cool and obviously you can get
cheaper<00:04:27.240> players<00:04:27.480> than<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.740> know<00:04:28.830> as

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
cheaper players than for you know as

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.920 
cheaper players than for you know as
well<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:29.760> cheaper<00:04:30.060> than<00:04:30.210> what<00:04:30.540> they<00:04:30.690> used<00:04:30.870> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
well for cheaper than what they used to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.510 
well for cheaper than what they used to
be<00:04:30.990> so<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.410> guess<00:04:31.770> that's<00:04:31.890> pretty<00:04:32.070> cool<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.430> you

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
be so I guess that's pretty cool and you

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.490 
be so I guess that's pretty cool and you
save<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.760> bit<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:32.970> carnage<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:33.660> that's<00:04:34.260> pretty

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
save a bit of carnage so that's pretty

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.470 
save a bit of carnage so that's pretty
cool<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.100> that's<00:04:35.670> pretty<00:04:35.820> much<00:04:35.970> everything<00:04:36.390> I

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
cool and that's pretty much everything I

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.210 
cool and that's pretty much everything I
needed<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.810> say<00:04:36.870> really<00:04:37.290> like<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:37.980> wanted
