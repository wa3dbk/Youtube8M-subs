that on later videos but what we have

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.599 
that on later videos but what we have
here<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.480> an<00:00:18.630> Isuzu<00:00:18.930> FRR<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.490> bit

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
here is an Isuzu FRR it's a little bit

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.400 
here is an Isuzu FRR it's a little bit
overwhelming<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:22.020> bigger<00:00:22.199> than

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
overwhelming it is a little bigger than

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.920 
overwhelming it is a little bigger than
the<00:00:22.529> NPR<00:00:23.010> which<00:00:23.220> we're<00:00:23.400> replacing<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the NPR which we're replacing but it is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.560 
the NPR which we're replacing but it is
a<00:00:25.199> beast<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.039> solid<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> drove

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a beast and it is solid and when I drove

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.179 
a beast and it is solid and when I drove
it<00:00:27.720> back<00:00:27.869> from<00:00:28.080> Montana<00:00:28.439> I'd<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> say

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it back from Montana I'd have to say

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.130 
it back from Montana I'd have to say
that<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.519> took<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:29.880> getting<00:00:29.910> used<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.420> just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that it took some getting used to just

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
that it took some getting used to just
because<00:00:31.320> you're<00:00:31.470> higher<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.910> solid

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
because you're higher but it is solid

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.520 
because you're higher but it is solid
and<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.750> think<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:33.989> will<00:00:34.050> hand<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:34.380> load

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and I think it will hand a little load

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040 
and I think it will hand a little load
quite<00:00:34.829> fine<00:00:35.040> well<00:00:35.610> let's<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> look<00:00:36.510> around

make<00:01:34.520> you'll<00:01:35.149> notice<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.840> has<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.459> lift<00:01:37.459> gate

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
make you'll notice it has a lift gate

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.819 
make you'll notice it has a lift gate
now<00:01:38.420> if<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:38.630> was<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> lift<00:01:39.200> gate<00:01:39.289> that<00:01:39.560> tucked

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
now if this was a lift gate that tucked

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.309 
now if this was a lift gate that tucked
underneath<00:01:40.099> the<00:01:40.789> box<00:01:41.479> I<00:01:41.780> think<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.170> probably

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
underneath the box I think I probably

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.679 
underneath the box I think I probably
hang<00:01:42.619> on<00:01:42.739> to<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.009> but<00:01:43.700> as<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.119> can<00:01:44.239> see<00:01:44.299> it's

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
hang on to it but as you can see it's

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.569 
hang on to it but as you can see it's
definitely<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.200> way<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:45.500> what<00:01:46.310> plan<00:01:46.549> is

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
definitely in the way so what plan is

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.399 
definitely in the way so what plan is
we're<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.420> go<00:01:47.539> ahead<00:01:47.629> and<00:01:47.959> remove<00:01:48.259> it

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
we're going to go ahead and remove it

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.609 
we're going to go ahead and remove it
and<00:01:48.590> sell<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.369> let's<00:01:50.119> take<00:01:50.209> a<00:01:50.270> look<00:01:50.450> inside<00:01:50.619> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
and sell it let's take a look inside the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.709 
and sell it let's take a look inside the
nice<00:01:51.770> thing<00:01:51.979> about<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.579> inside<00:01:52.939> box<00:01:53.179> is<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.599> as

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
nice thing about the inside box is it as

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.109 
nice thing about the inside box is it as
all<00:01:53.929> aluminum<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.579> will<00:01:55.759> handle<00:01:55.909> the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
all aluminum this will handle the

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.819 
all aluminum this will handle the
chemicals<00:01:56.599> handle<00:01:56.989> the<00:01:57.079> water<00:01:57.319> if<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.679> have<00:01:57.799> a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
chemicals handle the water if I have a

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.770 
chemicals handle the water if I have a
water<00:01:58.069> leak<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.849> course<00:01:59.060> we<00:01:59.239> usually<00:01:59.629> do

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
water leak and of course we usually do

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.589 
water leak and of course we usually do
every<00:02:00.229> once<00:02:00.409> in<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.590> while<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.569> a

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
every once in a while and we have a

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.209 
every once in a while and we have a
corrosion<00:02:02.989> resistance<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.679> course<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.099> the

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
corrosion resistance of course with the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.490 
corrosion resistance of course with the
aluminum<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.119> door<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.719> located<00:02:05.989> what's

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
aluminum this door is located what's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.440 
aluminum this door is located what's
called<00:02:06.709> at<00:02:06.859> the<00:02:06.979> second<00:02:07.369> position<00:02:07.609> first

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
called at the second position first

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.170 
called at the second position first
position<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.109> right<00:02:09.739> here<00:02:10.069> one<00:02:10.759> thing<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.030> am

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
position is right here one thing I am

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.000 
position is right here one thing I am
starting<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.450> become<00:02:11.660> familiar<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:12.109> is<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
starting to become familiar with is the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.259 
starting to become familiar with is the
e-track<00:02:13.459> system

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
e-track system

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.839 
e-track system
I've<00:02:14.900> noticing<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.440> has<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> four<00:02:16.040> rail

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
I've noticing this has a four rail

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.349 
I've noticing this has a four rail
system<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.709> already<00:02:18.709> installed<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.430> instead

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
system and already installed and instead

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.670 
system and already installed and instead
of<00:02:20.420> removing<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.079> think<00:02:21.260> I'm<00:02:21.349> going<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.560> make

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
of removing it I think I'm going to make

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.720 
of removing it I think I'm going to make
use<00:02:21.859> of<00:02:21.889> it<00:02:22.160> what<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.790> have<00:02:22.970> here<00:02:23.389> is<00:02:24.010> shelf<00:02:25.010> is

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
use of it what we have here is shelf is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.120 
use of it what we have here is shelf is
some<00:02:25.970> shelves<00:02:26.359> so<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:27.500> simply<00:02:27.709> drop<00:02:27.889> a

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
some shelves so you just simply drop a

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.640 
some shelves so you just simply drop a
2x4<00:02:28.849> screw<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:29.389> in<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.690> that'll<00:02:30.200> go<00:02:30.349> all<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
2x4 screw it in and that'll go all the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.949 
2x4 screw it in and that'll go all the
way<00:02:30.680> across<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.000> plan<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.419> to<00:02:32.450> put<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
way across so the plan is to put the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.140 
way across so the plan is to put the
performer<00:02:33.500> from<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.829> other<00:02:33.950> machine<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
performer from the other machine have it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.759 
performer from the other machine have it
bolted<00:02:35.450> right<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.290> corner<00:02:36.620> just

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
bolted right here in the corner just

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.550 
bolted right here in the corner just
enough<00:02:37.340> from<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.639> wall<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:38.450> be<00:02:38.540> able<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.870> get

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
enough from the wall to be able to get

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.409 
enough from the wall to be able to get
access<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.549> side<00:02:40.819> so<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.150> can<00:02:41.269> work

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:41.419 
access to that one side so we can work

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.110 
access to that one side so we can work
on<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.590> course<00:02:42.620> above<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.849> lot<00:02:44.090> of

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
on it and of course above it is a lot of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.610 
on it and of course above it is a lot of
wasted<00:02:44.450> space<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.019> think<00:02:45.319> I'm<00:02:45.440> going<00:02:45.590> to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
wasted space so I think I'm going to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.319 
wasted space so I think I'm going to
make<00:02:45.769> use<00:02:45.919> of<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.069> etrak<00:02:46.549> system<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.090> create

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
make use of that etrak system and create

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.360 
make use of that etrak system and create
a<00:02:47.389> shelf<00:02:47.720> going<00:02:48.470> all<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.739> way<00:02:48.769> across<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
a shelf going all the way across so I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.360 
a shelf going all the way across so I
can<00:02:49.519> store<00:02:49.700> blowers<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.540> other<00:02:50.840> equipment<00:02:51.530> as

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
can store blowers and other equipment as

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.580 
can store blowers and other equipment as
I<00:02:52.609> need<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:53.900> that'll<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.290> very

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
I need it so I think that'll be very

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.490 
I need it so I think that'll be very
handy<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.220> have<00:02:55.400> aside<00:02:56.090> from<00:02:56.299> those<00:02:56.500> shelf

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
handy to have aside from those shelf

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.199 
handy to have aside from those shelf
brackets<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.220> cost<00:02:58.400> eight<00:02:58.639> dollars<00:02:58.669> a<00:02:58.940> piece

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
brackets that cost eight dollars a piece

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.759 
brackets that cost eight dollars a piece
this<00:02:59.630> is<00:02:59.810> something<00:03:00.079> I<00:03:00.139> think<00:03:00.319> I'll<00:03:00.440> buy<00:03:00.590> more

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
this is something I think I'll buy more

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.830 
this is something I think I'll buy more
of<00:03:00.829> these<00:03:01.519> are<00:03:01.730> four<00:03:01.910> dollars<00:03:02.030> apiece<00:03:02.419> I<00:03:02.660> got

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
of these are four dollars apiece I got

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240 
of these are four dollars apiece I got

these at the local Harbor Freight but
these<00:03:04.400> are<00:03:04.549> just<00:03:04.849> hanger<00:03:05.299> up<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:07.010> simply

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
these are just hanger up just simply

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.449

think<00:03:24.020> beginning<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.740> this<00:03:24.950> etrac

think beginning to like this etrac

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.960 
think beginning to like this etrac
system<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:27.050> that's<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.800> is<00:03:28.069> build<00:03:28.640> number

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
system so that's it that is build number

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.660 
system so that's it that is build number
