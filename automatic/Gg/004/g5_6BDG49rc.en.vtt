00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.740
 by winning the broadcasters the final against in 2002 is the first time 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.550
 that ajax, just like a year earlier, has the right to participate in the final to the 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.699
 world cup 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.730
 This time Ajax wanted to go to South America to compete against it 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.009
 argentinian independent 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.650
 where the sun 4 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.640
 we just played over the beam again 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.839
 by the board 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.310
 whether they were willing to give permission 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.030
 And especially 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.290
 the other medical staff to give permission 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 in the rear window and argentina 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.660
 conquer world cup 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 it was of course a great world ranking 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 that started in Amsterdam of course 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.640
 about france spain 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.770
 slowly turning into cameras 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.920
 we have made a stopover in modern times 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.270
 the and those planes see the ladies in the front 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.420
 with a stopover 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.040
 But the then both schemes do if you have a higher one 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.470
 make four people 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.780
 certainly seventeen euro countries in an airplane 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.830
 well i'm walking here on a runway but it's 25 degrees 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.600
 at that time lands on the site where it was 50 degrees the drop 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.420
 we had a stopover congratulations guys from the plane running shoe on 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 because torso and what are we going to do about it 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 6 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.700
 6 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.360
 to put the butchers 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.960
 we have to 9 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.860
 yes it is of course laughable too i pulled out many times 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.570
 in fact the water in the stand was all broken 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.160
 lee 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 3 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.979
 that the condition is 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.339
 We got ten more when we arrived and the Russians 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:17.069
 works very terribly than when will we be many hours later 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.579
 it took some getting used to 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.059
 I sleep in bed at that time 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.239
 we also got 2 as a result 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.459
 two decent larger sleeping pills from the also throne I also still remember 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.369
 Which 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.810
 I have a sleeping pill I was afraid of 9 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.869
 everyone was asleep i have a sleeping pill from doctor wellink 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:42.109
 or all children released or I can not sleep because we had to go 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.529
 develop before the competition 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.599
 thereby 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.759
 about which goes very quickly of the world 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.379
 the law also be reminded there in the newspapers 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.029
 does he not know that the entire ajax team got drunk in total 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.109
 I remember well that I am barrios or a slight shrink 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.649
 to our room and that at some point we just step out of it 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.039
 the first floor 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 we did not know where we were at that time also brought to the room 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.569
 we've fallen for this and we've fallen asleep 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.789
 in the competition that has recently been a tough and tough competition 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 we wanted to win that if you just have a coin and the audience 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.049
 we started much better than in the clients 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.229
 they were really a bit impressed by ajax 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.699
 and so for just about squatter 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.089
 and then the kicking party started falling what I expected as a result 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:33.379
 they could already see that the bus is specially for the open sewer crow stage 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.639
 the he becomes more and more one 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.739
 the belgian on the fifth and from that this note possible 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.129
 the 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.999
 public 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.229
 who has a cheek full of smoke 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.529
 probe the boy's bicycle 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.709
 who can who got the high credits and appear in it was one 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.219
 after a long shot 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.260
 which, surprisingly, went in well, we played it finally became a leg 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.249
 it is, of course, to postpone the good result for a year 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.289
 there are more than normal 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:13.859
 you can even do it again 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.610
 we had played the match right away 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.590
 and 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.739
 in early June in the period went up in flames in a home match 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.900
 the olympic stadium in Amsterdam 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.440
 in that second final match in September has 3 in two sets 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.440
 the study is in Ajax on Wednesday
