 yes properties of today's topic 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.720
 until 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.300
 task manager does not start 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.700

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.619
 penetrated the virus that turned off

 this service sometimes in some cases 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.880
 it even happens that he just removes it but 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.650
 most often just disables the first thing 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.720
 need to do this of course check 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.420
 computer on viruses and virus destroy 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.700
 after that the problem will not be solved that is 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.710
 the virus will be deleted but task manager 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.110
 will also be disabled and in order to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.700
 enable it need to run 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.930
 the next steps you type on 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.760

 go on m that is this command 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.820
 English range of flour and we 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.920
 local group editor starts 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.640

 further administrative templates further 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.869

 delete the task manager state from us 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.450
 it is not set 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.430
 but in your case maybe that is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.250
 normal and correct state in your 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.890
 case may be set 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.380
 set that is, come here and you 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.390
