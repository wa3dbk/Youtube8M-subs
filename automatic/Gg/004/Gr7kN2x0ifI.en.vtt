00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 with p 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.450
 and now you are watching the most probably 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.900
 the most important most difficult video from the sleeper well 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 difficult and of course not necessary 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.449
 perception a complex first for me 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 because such actions are done 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 far from every day they are not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.410
 ordinary events and so what is this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.929
 acting on the actual situation 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.860
 such that many who subscribe to 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.930
 channel mod were somewhat surprised or 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 shocked by the fact that there are materials 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 come out not only on the world of tanks 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 but also in other games and did not even play 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.480
 on computer hardware 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 oddly enough even the program 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.610
 someone is 1 2 varnishes mouth and it pleased 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 because they were getting not only 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.690
 information about one game but much 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 more 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 however, since the wish was sufficient 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.640
 Numerous and I decided to have 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.630
 for the world of tanks 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 separate gaming channel and November 1 this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.799
 The channel was created and called but the expert 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.689
 This channel you can already find in the search 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.270
 well yout just go 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.460
 package which is in the description 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.159
 actually what he needs to do is set aside 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.130
 I hope to get support guys 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.259
 because it was created for you 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.340
 separate tank channel where there will be 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.829
 other games 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.890
 that is, this is what you asked me to 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.600
 however, if you think the channel is all 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 may cease to exist then 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 it's not going to go on it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.760
 materials on various other games but 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.450
 not for the world 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.390
 as well as reviews of iron and all 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.770
 another interesting thing for the audience 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.380
 channel sex is very digital respectively 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.650

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.090

 if you want to watch a video about tanks 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.450
