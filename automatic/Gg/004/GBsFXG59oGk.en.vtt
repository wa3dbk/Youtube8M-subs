00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
my favorite pet hack is the cat quarian
if<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:38.430> already<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.119> or<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.360> cats

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
if you already have one or two cats

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
if you already have one or two cats
maybe<00:01:40.020> even<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> don't<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> you're

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
maybe even more I don't know and you're

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
maybe even more I don't know and you're
getting<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.180> new<00:01:42.420> cat<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.200> always

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
getting a new cat you know it's always

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
getting a new cat you know it's always
better<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> keep<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.460> separated<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
better to keep them separated in a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.230 
better to keep them separated in a
different<00:01:45.689> room<00:01:45.899> however<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.490> personally

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
different room however I have personally

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.490 
different room however I have personally
found<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.780> better<00:01:48.990> when<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.350> can

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
found that it's better when they can

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
found that it's better when they can
actually<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:50.189> each<00:01:50.220> other<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:50.909> bit<00:01:51.119> it

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
actually see each other a little bit it

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
actually see each other a little bit it
gets<00:01:51.630> them<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.290> used<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.710> each

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
gets them a little bit more used to each

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460 
gets them a little bit more used to each
other<00:01:53.130> sure<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.450> may<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.930> hissing<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
other sure there may be some hissing and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.109 
other sure there may be some hissing and
fighting<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> great<00:01:56.549> news<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.759> this

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
fighting but the great news about this

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
fighting but the great news about this
is<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.390> can't<00:01:57.659> actually<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> each<00:01:58.500> other

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
is they can't actually get to each other

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.899 
is they can't actually get to each other
all<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.159> need<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.460> room<00:01:59.700> where<00:01:59.820> you're
