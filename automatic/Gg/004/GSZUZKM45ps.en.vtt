I just can show you if we set this

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
I just can show you if we set this
cutter<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:27.119> an<00:00:27.180> edge<00:00:27.300> forming<00:00:27.720> bearing

cutter I've got an edge forming bearing
guard<00:00:28.439> cutter<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.130> set<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.460> down<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.199> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
guard cutter on it set this down and to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
guard cutter on it set this down and to
make<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.710> edge<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.210> piece<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> wood<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
make an edge on this piece of wood you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.229 
make an edge on this piece of wood you
can<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.070> hands<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.430> still<00:00:35.640> quite<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
can see that my hands are still quite a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.900 
can see that my hands are still quite a
long<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.780> away<00:00:37.050> from<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.219> workplace<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.790> that

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
long way away from the workplace is that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
long way away from the workplace is that
there's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> big<00:00:39.540> gap<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:41.190> actually

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
there's a big gap here so it's actually

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
there's a big gap here so it's actually
more<00:00:41.940> difficult<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> maintain<00:00:43.110> control<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
more difficult to maintain control of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.369 
more difficult to maintain control of
the<00:00:44.040> machine<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:45.149> impossible<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the machine not impossible but just a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.630 
the machine not impossible but just a
little<00:00:46.469> bit<00:00:46.680> less<00:00:46.829> comfortable<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.399> center

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
little bit less comfortable the center

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.420 
little bit less comfortable the center
of<00:00:47.730> gravity's<00:00:48.149> higher<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.410> setup<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.160> if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
of gravity's higher on this setup so if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.080 
of gravity's higher on this setup so if
you<00:00:50.789> want<00:00:51.469> accuracy<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> reduce

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you want accuracy and you want to reduce

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.689 
you want accuracy and you want to reduce
the<00:00:54.300> risk<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.930> router<00:00:55.110> tilting<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the risk of the router tilting and you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
the risk of the router tilting and you
want<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> maintain<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.420> depth<00:00:58.020> once<00:00:58.350> you've

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
want to maintain that depth once you've

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.049 
want to maintain that depth once you've

tempting with a plunge router to lift
the<00:01:01.829> machine<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.789> reapply<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> down

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the machine and then reapply it down

onto the depth stop each time you do

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550 
onto the depth stop each time you do
this<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.450> could<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.260> introduce

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this you could actually introduce

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.910 
this you could actually introduce

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
in this case particularly if you've gone

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.920 
in this case particularly if you've gone
for<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.280> gmf<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> kit<00:01:17.970> contains<00:01:18.720> two

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
for the gmf that the kit contains two

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.980 
for the gmf that the kit contains two
bases<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:20.430> even<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:21.180> buying<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> base<00:01:21.750> as

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bases or even you're buying the base as

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
bases or even you're buying the base as
an<00:01:22.080> accessory<00:01:22.470> later<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.759> simply

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
an accessory later on you can simply

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
an accessory later on you can simply
take<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:25.409> router<00:01:25.619> motor<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:27.770> save<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
take the router motor out save the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
take the router motor out save the
plunging<00:01:29.460> base<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> next<00:01:30.390> application

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
plunging base for the next application

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
plunging base for the next application
that<00:01:31.619> needs<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.610> sort<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> then

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that needs that sort of thing and then

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.420 
that needs that sort of thing and then
put<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> motor<00:01:34.460> into<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.710> fixed<00:01:37.710> base<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
put the motor into the fixed base but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
put the motor into the fixed base but
look<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> key<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:40.439> look

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
look this is the key thing here now look

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
look this is the key thing here now look
how<00:01:40.860> low<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> handles<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
how low the handles are and a lot of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.870 
how low the handles are and a lot of
people<00:01:43.380> consider<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> fixed<00:01:44.159> base<00:01:44.310> router<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
people consider the fixed base router is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.289 
people consider the fixed base router is
the<00:01:45.329> original<00:01:45.780> router<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.119> great

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the original router and you get great

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.050 
the original router and you get great
control<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.229> put<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.159> hands<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
control you can put your hands on the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
control you can put your hands on the
handles<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.840> also<00:01:52.020> rest<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:53.159> hand

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
handles here it can also rest your hand

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.749 
handles here it can also rest your hand
on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.170> workpiece<00:01:55.170> itself<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> control
