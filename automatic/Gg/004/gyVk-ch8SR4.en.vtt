than<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.670> direction<00:06:38.970> of<00:06:39.180> the<00:06:39.330> first<00:06:39.690> film<00:06:40.050> as

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
than the direction of the first film as

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.130 
than the direction of the first film as
well<00:06:41.040> as<00:06:41.130> this<00:06:41.340> new<00:06:41.580> vision<00:06:42.060> of<00:06:42.090> a<00:06:42.360> less<00:06:42.570> darker

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
well as this new vision of a less darker

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.370 
well as this new vision of a less darker
atmosphere<00:06:43.800> like<00:06:44.010> before<00:06:45.020> another<00:06:46.020> good

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
atmosphere like before another good

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.010 
atmosphere like before another good
point<00:06:46.650> unlike<00:06:47.610> in<00:06:47.760> the<00:06:47.880> first<00:06:48.150> movie<00:06:48.600> the

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
point unlike in the first movie the

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.070 
point unlike in the first movie the
vampires<00:06:49.650> are<00:06:49.950> actually<00:06:50.700> scary<00:06:51.270> here<00:06:51.930> in

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
vampires are actually scary here in

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.980 
vampires are actually scary here in
particular<00:06:52.710> I<00:06:53.340> think<00:06:53.580> Dakota<00:06:54.240> Fanning<00:06:54.690> is<00:06:54.810> the

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
particular I think Dakota Fanning is the

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.900 
particular I think Dakota Fanning is the
new<00:06:55.140> character<00:06:55.620> Jane<00:06:55.980> looks<00:06:56.550> like<00:06:56.760> she's

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
new character Jane looks like she's

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.150 
new character Jane looks like she's
doing<00:06:57.210> a<00:06:57.300> good<00:06:57.480> job<00:06:57.540> and<00:06:58.380> we<00:06:58.560> didn't<00:06:58.830> even<00:06:58.920> get

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
doing a good job and we didn't even get

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.180 
doing a good job and we didn't even get
that<00:06:59.400> much<00:06:59.610> screen<00:07:00.120> time<00:07:00.150> of<00:07:00.660> her<00:07:00.810> and<00:07:01.190> finally

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
that much screen time of her and finally

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.730 
that much screen time of her and finally
this<00:07:02.520> also<00:07:02.850> turns<00:07:03.300> into<00:07:03.570> better<00:07:03.990> action<00:07:04.350> than

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
this also turns into better action than

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.010 
this also turns into better action than
what<00:07:04.980> we<00:07:05.130> got<00:07:05.340> in<00:07:05.490> the<00:07:05.610> first<00:07:05.940> movie<00:07:06.420> though<00:07:06.990> I

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
what we got in the first movie though I

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.470 
what we got in the first movie though I
still<00:07:07.530> do<00:07:07.740> not<00:07:07.950> take<00:07:08.310> back<00:07:08.520> my<00:07:08.760> comments<00:07:09.300> that

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
still do not take back my comments that

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.710 
still do not take back my comments that
this<00:07:09.660> is<00:07:09.870> a<00:07:09.930> teen<00:07:10.530> romantic<00:07:11.130> film<00:07:11.670> and<00:07:11.970> not

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
this is a teen romantic film and not

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.100 
this is a teen romantic film and not
some<00:07:13.140> supernatural<00:07:13.650> thriller<00:07:14.520> flick<00:07:15.110> so

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
some supernatural thriller flick so

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.690 
some supernatural thriller flick so
overall<00:07:16.620> my<00:07:17.310> opinion<00:07:17.970> is<00:07:18.150> simple<00:07:19.070> stop<00:07:20.070> trying

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
overall my opinion is simple stop trying

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.870 
overall my opinion is simple stop trying
to<00:07:20.970> make<00:07:21.180> this<00:07:21.810> movie<00:07:22.500> into<00:07:23.010> something<00:07:23.580> it's

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
to make this movie into something it's

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.090
