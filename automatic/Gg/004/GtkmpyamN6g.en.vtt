00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
crip the developer of this kernel went

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240 
crip the developer of this kernel went
back<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.340> cm9<00:00:24.269> kernel<00:00:25.039> for<00:00:26.039> better

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
back to the cm9 kernel for better

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.580 
back to the cm9 kernel for better
battery<00:00:26.730> life<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.119> more<00:00:27.330> stable<00:00:27.570> pneus<00:00:27.900> but

battery life and more stable pneus but

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.589 
battery life and more stable pneus but
you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.400> install<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> kernel<00:00:30.359> for

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you can you can install see a kernel for

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.720 
you can you can install see a kernel for
dual<00:00:30.779> boot<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:33.020> other<00:00:34.020> than<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
dual boot if you want to other than that

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.090 
dual boot if you want to other than that
also<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> tablet<00:00:36.239> UI<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.780> removed<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.890> sure

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
also the tablet UI was removed not sure

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
also the tablet UI was removed not sure
why<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:40.579> think<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> mms<00:00:42.570> features

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
why and I think some of the mms features

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.090 
why and I think some of the mms features
were<00:00:43.460> fixed<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.440> inverted<00:00:46.440> internal<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
were fixed and inverted internal and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.080 
were fixed and inverted internal and
external<00:00:47.420> sdcard<00:00:48.420> issues<00:00:49.050> were<00:00:49.230> fixed<00:00:49.680> um<00:00:50.090> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
external sdcard issues were fixed um so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.590 
external sdcard issues were fixed um so
highly<00:00:51.780> recommend<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.940> give<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.210> new

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
highly recommend it to give this new

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.970 
highly recommend it to give this new
version<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.050> try<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.320> you're<00:00:55.559> already<00:00:55.770> running

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
try that again um now there you go so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
try that again um now there you go so
now<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.570> web<00:01:37.049> OS<00:01:37.290> style<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
now you get web OS style so you can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
now you get web OS style so you can
close<00:01:38.970> apps<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:40.190> LCD<00:01:41.190> density<00:01:41.810> custom

like if you'd like mess with that um so
that's<00:04:55.210> pretty<00:04:55.510> much<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.350> version<00:04:56.980> 2.2<00:04:57.580> is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
that's pretty much it the version 2.2 is

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.510 
that's pretty much it the version 2.2 is
a<00:04:58.120> lot<00:04:58.540> more<00:04:58.720> simpler<00:04:59.080> also<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.620> install<00:05:00.100> just

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
a lot more simpler also to install just

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.770 
a lot more simpler also to install just
download<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.590> ROM<00:05:02.590> file<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.270> install<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.330> and

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
download the ROM file and install it and

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.720 
download the ROM file and install it and
that's<00:05:05.470> pretty<00:05:05.650> much<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.920> it's<00:05:06.400> just<00:05:06.550> a

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
that's pretty much it it's just a

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.700 
that's pretty much it it's just a
standard<00:05:07.090> installation<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:08.260> also<00:05:08.410> has

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
standard installation it also has

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.210 
standard installation it also has
default<00:05:09.720> theme<00:05:10.720> if<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.170> want<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.500> get<00:05:11.620> like<00:05:12.190> a

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
default theme if you want to get like a

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.460 
default theme if you want to get like a
default<00:05:12.730> default<00:05:13.150> theme<00:05:13.540> this<00:05:13.720> is<00:05:13.870> actually

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
default default theme this is actually

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.060 
default default theme this is actually
pitch<00:05:14.710> black<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:16.360> when<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:16.990> go<00:05:17.170> into<00:05:17.560> like

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
pitch black so when you go into like

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.310 
pitch black so when you go into like
play<00:05:18.490> store<00:05:18.820> you'll<00:05:19.180> get<00:05:19.420> a<00:05:19.780> slightly

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
play store you'll get a slightly

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.680 
play store you'll get a slightly
black-themed<00:05:21.130> which<00:05:21.850> is<00:05:22.000> kind<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.300> cool<00:05:22.360> i

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
black-themed which is kind of cool i

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.150 
black-themed which is kind of cool i
like<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.140> I'm<00:05:23.350> not<00:05:23.410> going<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.740> change<00:05:23.980> it

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
like it so I'm not going to change it

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.780 
like it so I'm not going to change it
see<00:05:24.310> how<00:05:24.400> its<00:05:24.550> backgrounds<00:05:25.240> kind<00:05:25.450> of<00:05:25.510> black<00:05:25.690> um

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
see how its backgrounds kind of black um

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.360 
see how its backgrounds kind of black um
so<00:05:27.790> I<00:05:27.820> think<00:05:28.120> that's<00:05:28.450> pretty<00:05:28.690> much<00:05:28.930> it<00:05:29.140> and<00:05:29.590> go

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
so I think that's pretty much it and go

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.370 
so I think that's pretty much it and go
ahead<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.580> flash<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.210> 2.2<00:05:31.750> if<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:31.990> haven't

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
ahead and flash the 2.2 if you haven't

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.910 
ahead and flash the 2.2 if you haven't
um<00:05:32.760> certainly<00:05:33.760> still<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.540> best<00:05:34.810> ICS<00:05:35.530> rom<00:05:35.620> I

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
um certainly still the best ICS rom I

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.280 
um certainly still the best ICS rom I
think<00:05:36.190> for<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.580> galaxy<00:05:37.030> s2<00:05:37.180> although<00:05:38.050> I'll

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
think for the galaxy s2 although I'll

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.340 
think for the galaxy s2 although I'll
keep<00:05:38.860> reviewing<00:05:39.430> more<00:05:39.700> arms<00:05:40.110> definitely<00:05:41.110> a
