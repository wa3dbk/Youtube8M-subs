people and you buy a cow and you freeze
it<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:43.310> stuff<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:43.580> that<00:05:43.910> because<00:05:44.060> I<00:05:44.450> think

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
it and stuff like that because I think

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.270 
it and stuff like that because I think
this<00:05:44.990> is<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.170> right<00:05:45.290> way<00:05:45.440> to<00:05:45.500> do<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:45.830> but

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
this is the right way to do it but

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.710 
this is the right way to do it but
hopefully<00:05:46.670> this<00:05:46.820> gave<00:05:47.030> you<00:05:47.210> more<00:05:47.360> clarity

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720
