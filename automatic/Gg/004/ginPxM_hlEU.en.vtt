go to the thin now right leg technique

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.860 
go to the thin now right leg technique
will<00:01:23.950> fall<00:01:24.160> through<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.580> cross<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:25.390> couple

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
will fall through the cross a couple

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.180 
will fall through the cross a couple
follow-through<00:01:26.320> techniques<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.920> could<00:01:27.070> do

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
follow-through techniques you could do

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.620 
follow-through techniques you could do
is<00:01:27.370> if<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.580> pick<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.820> leg<00:01:28.090> up<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.420> fall

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
is if you pick the leg up and fall

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.290 
is if you pick the leg up and fall
forward<00:01:29.020> hard<00:01:29.260> that<00:01:29.590> when<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.280> punch<00:01:30.580> you're
