00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
I went ahead and somewhere here I cut

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.430 
I went ahead and somewhere here I cut
out<00:03:12.570> all<00:03:13.730> three<00:03:14.730> sizes

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
out all three sizes

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.460 
out all three sizes
we're<00:03:16.440> gonna<00:03:16.620> need<00:03:16.860> today<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:18.989> done

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
let's show you how this works I just

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.420 
let's show you how this works I just
have<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.350> say<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.739> when<00:03:25.860> my<00:03:26.010> kids<00:03:26.250> were

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
have to say that when my kids were

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.479 
have to say that when my kids were
little<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.940> would<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.390> had<00:03:27.570> fun<00:03:28.489> cutting

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
little they would have had fun cutting

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.250 
little they would have had fun cutting
shapes<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.150> these<00:03:30.360> bunches<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.140> then

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
shapes out of these bunches and then

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.840 
shapes out of these bunches and then
putting<00:03:31.560> them<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:31.890> water<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.640> can<00:03:32.820> also<00:03:34.850> trace

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
putting them in water you can also trace

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.630 
putting them in water you can also trace
a<00:03:36.269> design<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:36.989> here<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.530> could<00:03:37.830> find<00:03:38.130> an<00:03:38.310> image

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
a design on here you could find an image

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.370 
a design on here you could find an image
blow<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.209> get<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> size<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.170> want

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
blow it up get the size that you want

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.110 
blow it up get the size that you want
trace<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.130> here<00:03:41.400> cut<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.760> with<00:03:41.880> pair

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
trace it on here cut out with pair

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.710 
trace it on here cut out with pair
scissors<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:43.489> flexible<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:45.060> fact<00:03:45.570> I

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
scissors it's really flexible in fact I

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.930 
scissors it's really flexible in fact I
did<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.320> when<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.560> was<00:03:46.680> trying<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:49.790> make<00:03:50.790> an

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940

apron and I didn't have any small
children<00:03:53.580> around<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.239> wanted<00:03:54.600> kids

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
children around and I wanted kids

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.340 
children around and I wanted kids
handprints<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.430> found<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.970> handprint<00:03:57.390> cut<00:03:58.260> it

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
handprints so I found a handprint cut it

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.979 
handprints so I found a handprint cut it
out<00:03:58.470> with<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.620> pair<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:58.890> scissors<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.810> that

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
out with a pair of scissors and that

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.199 
out with a pair of scissors and that
looked<00:04:01.170> fine<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.980> let<00:04:02.130> me<00:04:02.220> show<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.430> when<00:04:03.120> you

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
looked fine so let me show you when you

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.250 
looked fine so let me show you when you
stick<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> water<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.920> immediately

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
stick this in the water it immediately

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.110 
stick this in the water it immediately
expands<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:08.100> piece<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.730> foam<00:04:09.709> so

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.090 

bring<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.240> out<00:04:16.310> get<00:04:17.310> all<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:19.220> excess<00:04:20.220> water

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
bring it out get all the excess water

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:34.160 
bring it out get all the excess water
that<00:04:23.100> aside<00:04:31.250> now<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:33.240> could<00:04:33.540> put<00:04:33.750> your<00:04:33.900> paint

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
that aside now you could put your paint

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.440 
that aside now you could put your paint
directly<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:35.460> but<00:04:35.670> when<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
directly on here but when you do that

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.570 
directly on here but when you do that
you<00:04:36.750> usually<00:04:37.140> end<00:04:37.530> up<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.890> concentration

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
you usually end up with a concentration

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.440 
you usually end up with a concentration
of<00:04:39.000> paint<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.110> then<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.770> doesn't<00:04:41.160> have<00:04:41.400> that

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
of paint and then it doesn't have that

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.220 
of paint and then it doesn't have that
sponged<00:04:42.450> look<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.290> so<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:43.980> prefer<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:45.140> put<00:04:46.140> it

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
sponged look to it so I prefer to put it

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:58.040 
sponged look to it so I prefer to put it
on<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.380> brush<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:54.800> when<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> put<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.840> the

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
on a brush and when I put it on to the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.660 
on a brush and when I put it on to the
sponge<00:04:58.440> I<00:05:00.020> want<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.110> be<00:05:01.200> careful<00:05:01.470> for<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> same

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
sponge I want to be careful for the same

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.060 
sponge I want to be careful for the same
reason<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.210> not<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.570> just<00:05:03.780> totally<00:05:04.290> blob<00:05:04.830> it

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
reason and not to just totally blob it

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.030 
reason and not to just totally blob it
right<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.820> there<00:05:06.030> but<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.720> spread<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.860> around

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
right on there but to spread it around

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.520 
right on there but to spread it around
so<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:10.400> it's<00:05:11.540> equally<00:05:14.690> covering<00:05:15.690> everything

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
so that it's equally covering everything

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.480 
so that it's equally covering everything
I<00:05:18.110> like<00:05:19.110> doing<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.590> with<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.740> little<00:05:19.980> bit<00:05:20.220> of

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
I like doing it with a little bit of

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.750 
I like doing it with a little bit of
moisture<00:05:21.420> in<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.080> sponge<00:05:22.380> it's<00:05:23.220> not<00:05:23.400> enough

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
moisture in the sponge it's not enough

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.250 
moisture in the sponge it's not enough
to<00:05:24.000> dilute<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.510> paint<00:05:24.690> at<00:05:24.990> all<00:05:25.220> if<00:05:26.220> I<00:05:27.260> cranked

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
to dilute the paint at all if I cranked

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.340 
to dilute the paint at all if I cranked
out<00:05:28.520> my<00:05:29.520> little<00:05:29.760> flowers<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.570> day<00:05:30.690> before<00:05:30.900> I

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
out my little flowers the day before I

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.500 
out my little flowers the day before I
like<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.950> read<00:05:32.340> moisten<00:05:32.880> them<00:05:33.030> with<00:05:33.300> water

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
like to read moisten them with water

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.630 
like to read moisten them with water
because<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:34.500> following<00:05:34.890> day<00:05:35.070> they're<00:05:35.280> you

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
know dried and hard and they don't work

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.399 
know dried and hard and they don't work
as<00:05:42.720> well<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:43.650> let<00:05:44.130> me<00:05:44.250> get<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.460> white

spread<00:05:50.409> this<00:05:50.620> out<00:05:51.150> for<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.210> second<00:05:52.539> make<00:05:53.020> sure

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
spread this out for a second make sure

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.140 
spread this out for a second make sure
you<00:05:53.349> either<00:05:53.409> cut<00:05:53.830> off<00:05:53.949> your<00:05:54.159> tag<00:05:54.400> or<00:05:54.849> get<00:05:55.030> it

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
impression of that behind so figure out

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.830 
impression of that behind so figure out
your<00:06:04.629> placement<00:06:05.319> and<00:06:06.150> then<00:06:07.150> because<00:06:07.569> these
