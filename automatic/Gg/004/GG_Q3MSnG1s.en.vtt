00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
engine and the engine is gonna be made

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.990 
engine and the engine is gonna be made
with<00:01:10.170> two<00:01:10.409> Pistons<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.159> piece<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> redstone

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

dust two redstone torches and a furnace

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
dust two redstone torches and a furnace
that's<00:01:15.210> gonna<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.600> engine<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.500> your

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's gonna be an engine and then your

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.260 
that's gonna be an engine and then your
ears<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.159> combine<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.580> those<00:01:18.000> things

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
ears you can combine all those things

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
ears you can combine all those things
together<00:01:18.450> plus<00:01:19.009> some<00:01:20.009> iron<00:01:20.189> ingots<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
together plus some iron ingots in the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
together plus some iron ingots in the
chest<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.110> iron<00:01:22.380> ingots

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
chest and so it's gonna be iron ingots

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.390 
chest and so it's gonna be iron ingots
engine<00:01:23.610> chest<00:01:24.240> wheels<00:01:25.020> ironing<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.159> wheels

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
engine chest wheels ironing it in wheels

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
engine chest wheels ironing it in wheels
that's<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> pattern<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.270> you're

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that's to be the pattern that you're

down here we'll say fuel at it so I'm

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.610 
down here we'll say fuel at it so I'm
gonna<00:02:12.150> keep<00:02:12.330> trying<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.900> until<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
gonna keep trying this until it it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.260 
gonna keep trying this until it it
actually<00:02:14.040> works<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.640> there<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.790> go<00:02:14.910> it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
actually works and there you go it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.880 
actually works and there you go it
actually<00:02:15.570> went<00:02:15.690> through<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.990> says<00:02:16.140> added<00:02:16.560> fuel

let me go ahead out here I gotta fix my
arm<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:24.840> go

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
arm there we go

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.199 
arm there we go
painted<00:02:25.709> one<00:02:25.800> does<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.310> alright<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.060> then

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
painted one does that alright so then

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.820 
painted one does that alright so then
basically<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.990> do<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> go<00:02:28.350> forward

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
basically all you do is you go forward

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.949 
basically all you do is you go forward
or<00:02:29.040> backwards<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.760> drive<00:02:30.000> shift<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.810> an

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
or backwards to drive shift is an

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.140 
or backwards to drive shift is an
instant<00:02:31.290> break<00:02:31.500> if<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.370> press<00:02:32.670> shift<00:02:32.700> while

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
instant break if you press shift while

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.060 
instant break if you press shift while
driving<00:02:33.390> like<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.440> will<00:02:34.650> slow<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:34.980> down

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
driving like this it will slow you down

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.430 
driving like this it will slow you down
to<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> grinding<00:02:35.580> halt<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.320> when<00:02:37.320> you're

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
to a grinding halt and when you're

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.290 
to a grinding halt and when you're
driving<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.190> car<00:02:38.220> actually<00:02:38.850> sort<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.060> poops

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
driving the car actually sort of poops

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.790 
driving the car actually sort of poops
out<00:02:39.450> these<00:02:39.600> little<00:02:39.810> smoke<00:02:40.080> things<00:02:40.320> which<00:02:40.680> is

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
out these little smoke things which is

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.650 
out these little smoke things which is
really<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.250> cool<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.209> sort<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.480> looks

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
really really cool so it sort of looks

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.210 
really really cool so it sort of looks
like<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.110> know<00:02:43.200> exhaust<00:02:43.560> from<00:02:43.770> your<00:02:43.950> car<00:02:44.130> or

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
like you know exhaust from your car or

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
whatever and basically we can just drive

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.850 
whatever and basically we can just drive
around<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.870> also<00:02:49.200> what's<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.530> cool<00:02:49.800> about

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
around and also what's really cool about

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.750 
around and also what's really cool about
it<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.220> goes<00:02:50.489> up<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.660> block<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> if

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
