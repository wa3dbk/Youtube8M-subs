by<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> previous<00:00:08.700> video<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:10.019> showed<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> use

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
by a previous video I showed how to use

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.860 
by a previous video I showed how to use
the<00:00:12.420> inputs<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.440> my<00:00:13.620> fast<00:00:14.130> track<00:00:14.219> pro<00:00:14.750> while<00:00:15.750> at

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the inputs on my fast track pro while at

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.840 
the inputs on my fast track pro while at
the<00:00:15.929> same<00:00:16.139> time<00:00:16.199> using<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.369> speakers<00:00:17.820> that

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the same time using the speakers that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
the same time using the speakers that
are<00:00:18.180> connected<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:19.199> computer<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.980> way

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
are connected to my computer and the way

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.540 
are connected to my computer and the way
I<00:00:23.160> did<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.240> by<00:00:24.449> changing<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.920> recording

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
I did that was by changing the recording

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
I did that was by changing the recording
device<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> primary<00:00:28.019> core<00:00:28.260> according

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
device or the primary core according

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.780 
device or the primary core according
device<00:00:29.099> from<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> microphone<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:32.369> line

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
device from the microphone to the line

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.810 
device from the microphone to the line
from<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> line<00:00:34.170> 12<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> fast<00:00:35.370> track<00:00:35.579> pro

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
from the line 12 from the fast track pro

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.290 
from the line 12 from the fast track pro
I<00:00:36.059> had<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> configure<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> jack<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
I had to configure it jack so that it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260 
I had to configure it jack so that it
would<00:00:39.450> pick<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:40.430> whichever<00:00:41.430> device<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.120> set

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
would pick up whichever device was set

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.200 
would pick up whichever device was set
as<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.510> primary<00:00:43.079> device<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.700> input<00:00:44.879> was

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
as the primary device so the input was

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.520 
as the primary device so the input was
set<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> Hardware<00:00:45.870> 0<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> output

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
set to Hardware 0 and so was the output

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
set to Hardware 0 and so was the output
which<00:00:49.530> means<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> change<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> made<00:00:50.969> here

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
which means that change is made here

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.880 
which means that change is made here
would<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.140> picked<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.710> by<00:00:52.980> Jack<00:00:54.890> an

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
would be picked up by Jack an

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.990 
would be picked up by Jack an
alternative<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.730> doing<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:59.000> instead

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
alternative way of doing this is instead

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.229 
alternative way of doing this is instead
of<00:01:00.149> defining<00:01:01.280> hardware<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> 0<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> input

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of defining hardware a 0 as the input

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.080 
of defining hardware a 0 as the input
device<00:01:04.220> gonna<00:01:05.510> define<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.840> specific<00:01:07.020> device

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
device gonna define a specific device

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
device gonna define a specific device
which<00:01:09.090> means<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> change

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
which means I do not have to change

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
which means I do not have to change
anything<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.119> leave<00:01:12.450> everything

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
anything here so I can leave everything

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.880 
anything here so I can leave everything
the<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.850> making<00:01:15.409> make<00:01:16.409> sure<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the way it is just making make sure that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.929 
the way it is just making make sure that
my<00:01:17.210> speakers<00:01:18.470> are<00:01:19.470> set<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> default<00:01:20.130> but

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
my speakers are set as the default but

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
my speakers are set as the default but
the<00:01:21.090> recording<00:01:21.540> device<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.619> defined

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the recording device will be defined

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.660 
the recording device will be defined
within<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.060> jack<00:01:24.390> set<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
within the jack set up now to do so I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
within the jack set up now to do so I
have<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> close<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.390> otherwise<00:01:27.780> i'll<00:01:28.229> get

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
have to close this otherwise i'll get

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.450 
have to close this otherwise i'll get
some<00:01:29.150> weird<00:01:30.150> error<00:01:30.420> message<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.500> there's<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
some weird error message so there's this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
some weird error message so there's this
little<00:01:33.090> button<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.509> when<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> click<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
little button here when I click on it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.870 
little button here when I click on it
there's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.759> list<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.860> available<00:01:37.860> devices<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
there's a list of available devices that

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.620 
there's a list of available devices that
I<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.240> use<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> them<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.280> align<00:01:41.909> 12

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I can use and one of them is to align 12

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.389 
I can use and one of them is to align 12
from<00:01:43.110> fastrack<00:01:43.710> pro<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.759> select<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:46.399> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
from fastrack pro so if I select that it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.929 
from fastrack pro so if I select that it
will<00:01:47.670> use<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:49.320> device<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.399> rather<00:01:50.759> than

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
will use that device now rather than

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.240 
will use that device now rather than
whatever<00:01:51.360> i<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.869> defined<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.890> primary

whatever i have defined as the primary

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.389 
whatever i have defined as the primary
device<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.320> that<00:01:55.320> also<00:01:55.950> means<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
device and that also means that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.230 
device and that also means that
applications<00:01:57.360> using<00:01:57.740> jack<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.009> their<00:01:59.250> audio

applications using jack as their audio

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.740 
applications using jack as their audio
device<00:02:00.890> will<00:02:01.890> use<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.340> input<00:02:03.000> from<00:02:03.329> faster

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
device will use the input from faster

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.010 
device will use the input from faster
