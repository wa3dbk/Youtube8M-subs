00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.260
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.610
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.520
 all very well today we are going to talk about 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.950
 holography I will give two news in two 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.800
 videos in one because I do not want to stretch 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.950
 I want something scientific then we're going to 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.750
 talk about mercury and on the other hand 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.970
 we're also going to talk about a series of 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.270
 Mysteries first in first 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.460
 place I will put the mystery and that is 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.649
 many of us have asked ourselves the question of whether 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.019
 we live in a hologram because the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.870
 scientists demonstrate the theory of 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.489
 holographic principle even though it 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.980
 usually think that the universe is 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.170
 three-dimensional scientists the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.289
 University of Vienna Technology in 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.320
 austria they make sure we could live 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.149
 in a hologram the scientists assure 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.969
 who have managed to demonstrate the 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.039
 holographic principle is a conjecture 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.370
 about theories of gravity 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.370
 quantum proposal in 93 by gerard 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.680
 ter hoft according to the report published in 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.510
 the portal of the university the idea 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.450
 main of this theory consists 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.080
 instead of being a space 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 three-dimensional that is space 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.160
 Three-dimensional or three-dimensional 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.220
 we see the height the length and the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.560
 depth the universe would have a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.050
 Two-dimensional structure similar to a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.970
 hologram whose projection reflects 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.990
 in a on a cosmic horizon 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 immensely long to this spectrum one 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.440
 of the researchers 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.560
 danielle grumier believes that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.020
 our universe is quite flat and in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.960
 astronomical distances has curvature 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 positive fact that could show that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.400
 we live in a huge hologram the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 Question is we are also 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.600
 holograms 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.040
 of this and we will get much more in others 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.880
 in other videos 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.270
 but 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.909
 and I leave that little snack for you 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.900
 go making your mouth and appetite for 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.959
 possibly tomorrow's video and we go with 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.800
 another news that this is news is 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.560
 that the messenger probe of the NASA reveals 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.220
 the stunning photos before finalizing 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.230
 its mission crashing into mercury the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 nasa messenger probe has achieved 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.239
 Take stunning and detailed images 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.190
 of mercury before crashing on 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.370
 the surface of the planet closest to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.739
 sun next Thursday , April 30 at 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.870
 finish then your space mission the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.720
 Messenger probe was launched at 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.330
 space in the year 2004 or they were already 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 nine years ago and not 11 years ago and 11 years ago 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.579
 11 years and has taken more than 250 thousand 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.829
 images of it has taken what 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.540
 would be his last photos of the 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.630
 surface of the planet closest to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.579
 sun before crashing on this the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.040
 next Thursday the shocking 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.600
 photographs that are transformed by 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.390
 a spectrometer 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.090
 to the monochromatic originals show 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.240
 detailed volcanic adventures and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.400
 recent characters it is expected that the 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.670
 ship crashes with the surface of the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.430
 planet at 39 kilometers per second the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.820
 Thursday, April 30 at seven thirty 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.370
 pm this will happen on a surface 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.910
 of the planet that is not visible from the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.220
 land the messenger probe that has fabric 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.330
 by its acronyms is the chronic has the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.840
 acronym today the acronym of mercury 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.700
 surface space environment geochemistry 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.280
 and ranging great, let's go 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.990
 messenger and it is better to orbit the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.470
 Mercury planet since March of the year 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.780
 2011 after a journey of a few years of 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.720
 travel settings for the three planets 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.120
 interiors closest to the sun 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.330
 including our planet finalizing its 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.819
 long journey of 11 years then of a 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.060
 pretty cruel way 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:15.439
 dropping and crashing on the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.750
 surface of the objective for which it was 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:20.060
 created so nothing guys I hope you 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.160
 still interested these two news are 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.169
 very very very interesting and at the same 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.960
 important and revealing time for a 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.099
 scientific future and see you in another 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.240
 more video of this channel 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.240
 until the next ciao
