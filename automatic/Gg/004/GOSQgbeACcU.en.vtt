00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.249
 modern megacities we all 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.710
 more often run into shortage 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.619
 free space what 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.279
 makes us look for new ways to apply 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.300
 it would seem their traditional 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.579
 constructions 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.919
 idea to use surface flat 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.320
 roofs for parking and walking areas 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 implemented in Europe for many years 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 flat and sabotage roofing 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.350
 on the stand will be demonstrated 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.030
 the main stages of a device like 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.030
 constructions 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.180
 on the flat roof surface 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.290
 set and presentational 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.260
 cover 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.540
 this is a traditional single layer coating 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.350
 which goes to the surface of the roof 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 using gas chambers 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.080
 to ensure continuity of coverage 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 waterproofing material 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.510
 pasted on the next canvas 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510
 daughter-in-law at least September 10 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.990
 as thermal insulation 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 used in suit tile 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 extruded polystyrene foam 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.060
 express course 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.850
 thanks to the closed porous structure 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.229
 course plates express neither lose their 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.780
 quality technical properties 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.270
 even with direct 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.450
 water contact 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.149
 for this figurative edge flit straight 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.340
 allows you to stack them Austrians better 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.749
 cretin thickness 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.189
 provided by this technical 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.189
 coating uniformity 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.400
 for top heat insulating 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.940
 slabs 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.080
 fit your coaching out 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.379
 first text 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.609
 this material is prevented they 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.930
 did not take the drainage ditch particles 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.700
 ground 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.480
 and when cargoes penetrate through 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.300
 the thickness of the coating is at the same time more active and 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.660
 cold water as prigruz 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.709
 providing the design position 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.519
 insulation under the influence 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.310
 wind loads most often using 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.310
 committed the small fraction 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.479
 on leveled surface 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.959
 previous suloev fit other 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.149
 geotextile root act 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.699
 high strength this material also 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.209
 easily passes water but at the same time not 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.439
 allow plant roots 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.439
 not enough design 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.049
 the top layer can serve as a lawn 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:00.849
 grass 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.319
 this is just one of the possible options 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.359
 coating 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.869
 can be made of paving slabs 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.869
 crushed stone on celsius or asphalt concrete 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.579
 main distinctive 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.870
 consumer qualities 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.189
 sabotage roof structures 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.469
 is that the average life 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.329
 before overhaul is determined 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.729
 service life of waterproofing 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.379
 material in the absence of a mark 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.909
 plumage but temperature 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.489
 The mode I'm focused on is mechanical 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.059
 loads of such greenhouse conditions 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.249
 ordinary waterproofing can 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.779
 serve at least 30 years
