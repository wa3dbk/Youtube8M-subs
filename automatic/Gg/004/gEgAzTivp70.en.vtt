and when you open it it's a stack of
Hearts<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.050> see<00:02:29.230> that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
Hearts can you see that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.089 
Hearts can you see that
and<00:02:31.080> basically<00:02:32.080> it's<00:02:32.560> one<00:02:32.739> sheet<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> paper

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
and basically it's one sheet of paper

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.680 
and basically it's one sheet of paper
with<00:02:33.730> lots<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.239> cutting<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.900> one<00:02:35.830> heart<00:02:36.690> from

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
with lots of cutting and one heart from

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.680 
with lots of cutting and one heart from
the<00:02:38.110> very<00:02:38.319> center<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:39.129> cut<00:02:39.790> out<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.510> rest

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the very center is cut out but the rest

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.180 
the very center is cut out but the rest
would<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.170> lie<00:02:41.349> flat<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:44.349> can<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.799> use

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
would just lie flat and you can just use

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.220 
would just lie flat and you can just use
that<00:02:45.400> heart<00:02:45.610> as<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.819> decoration<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.660> guess<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.049> can

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
that heart as a decoration I guess I can

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.650 
that heart as a decoration I guess I can
show<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.269> pull<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:49.810> apart<00:02:51.660> there

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
show you so if I pull this apart there

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.210 
show you so if I pull this apart there
we<00:02:52.810> go<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:54.849> you<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.489> is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
we go and then you can see that this is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.660 
we go and then you can see that this is
your<00:03:00.220> image<00:03:00.670> always<00:03:01.209> hard<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.660> rotate<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.400> this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
your image always hard to rotate so this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.970 
your image always hard to rotate so this
is<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.000> full<00:03:04.180> sheet<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.750> one<00:03:05.560> came<00:03:05.799> out

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.900 
is the full sheet and that one came out
and<00:03:06.900> those<00:03:07.900> two<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:09.220> cut<00:03:09.519> with<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> knife

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and those two I just cut with a knife

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:18.740 
and those two I just cut with a knife
and<00:03:11.430> then<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.959> intro<00:03:14.349> insert<00:03:14.860> two<00:03:15.160> slits<00:03:16.500> and

cutting knife and you feel comfortable
cutting<00:03:40.299> this<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.720> think<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.049> took<00:03:41.230> me<00:03:41.410> probably

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
cutting this I think it took me probably

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.309 
cutting this I think it took me probably
about<00:03:42.970> half<00:03:43.269> an<00:03:43.389> hour<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.780> does<00:03:43.959> take<00:03:44.169> a<00:03:44.200> bit

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
about half an hour so it does take a bit

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.770 
about half an hour so it does take a bit
but<00:03:44.889> you<00:03:45.370> know<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.819> your<00:03:45.970> loved<00:03:46.150> ones<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.660> think

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.349

it's always nice to to put some extra
time<00:03:49.569> rather<00:03:50.530> than<00:03:50.829> money

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340
