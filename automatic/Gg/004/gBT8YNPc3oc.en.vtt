the<00:02:47.580> phone<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.610> how<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:52.760> how<00:02:53.760> its<00:02:53.940> kind

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the phone and see how it is how its kind

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.850 
the phone and see how it is how its kind
of<00:02:54.240> long<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:55.050> actually<00:02:55.140> longer<00:02:55.440> than<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
of long it's actually longer than the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.590 
of long it's actually longer than the
original<00:02:55.950> RAZR<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.730> my<00:02:58.130> one<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.600> just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
original RAZR and my one of you I just

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.260 
original RAZR and my one of you I just
think<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.500> because<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.850> feels<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.210> way

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
think it is because it feels that way

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.370 
think it is because it feels that way
when<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.480> hold<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.750> against<00:03:04.020> my<00:03:04.140> ear

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
when I hold it against my ear

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.260 
when I hold it against my ear
um<00:03:05.180> sure<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.330> see<00:03:06.810> here<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.310> go<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:11.270> music
