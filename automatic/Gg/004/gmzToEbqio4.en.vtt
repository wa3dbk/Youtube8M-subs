00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
first is called TTFN it's a thunderbolt

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
first is called TTFN it's a thunderbolt
based<00:00:32.309> output<00:00:32.790> device<00:00:33.090> basically<00:00:33.690> taking

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
based output device basically taking

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
based output device basically taking
video<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.950> through<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> thunderbolt

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
video out through a thunderbolt

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530 
video out through a thunderbolt
connection<00:00:36.480> straight<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.380> HD<00:00:37.860> SDI<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.760> HDMI

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
connection straight to HD SDI and HDMI
output<00:00:39.960> simultaneously<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> very

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
output simultaneously so it's a very

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880

can record that raw data directly so

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.760 
can record that raw data directly so
you've<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.600> access<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.200> raw<00:01:37.380> media

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you've got access to your raw media

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
you've got access to your raw media
you've<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.610> 4k<00:01:39.000> Pro<00:01:39.240> res<00:01:39.420> file<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you've got your 4k Pro res file that you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
you've got your 4k Pro res file that you
can<00:01:40.020> work<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.200> quickly<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.549> also

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
can work with quickly and it will also

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.870 
can work with quickly and it will also
simultaneously<00:01:42.270> output<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.619> 4k<00:01:44.310> monitor<00:01:44.729> an

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
simultaneously output to a 4k monitor an

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
simultaneously output to a 4k monitor an
SDI<00:01:45.600> monitor<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.470> HDI<00:01:46.799> monitor<00:01:47.310> all

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
SDI monitor and an HDI monitor all

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.219 
SDI monitor and an HDI monitor all
simultaneously<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> really

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
simultaneously so this is a really

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.289 
simultaneously so this is a really
powerful<00:01:49.500> device<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.640> interesting<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
powerful device really interesting and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
powerful device really interesting and
it's<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:51.990> 4k<00:01:52.380> workflows<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's not just for 4k workflows it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
it's not just for 4k workflows it
actually<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:54.000> HD<00:01:54.509> workflows<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.079> well

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
actually can do HD workflows as well

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.440 
actually can do HD workflows as well
it's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> full<00:01:55.680> 444<00:01:56.430> recorder<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> first

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's a full 444 recorder it's the first

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's a full 444 recorder it's the first
444<00:01:58.110> recorder<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> key<00:01:59.250> pro

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
444 recorder that we have in the key pro

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
444 recorder that we have in the key pro
line<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.299> adds<00:02:00.420> extra<00:02:00.869> quality<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.619> top<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
line so it adds extra quality on top of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
line so it adds extra quality on top of
the<00:02:02.219> ability<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.820> 4k<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.600> device<00:02:03.899> can

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the ability to do 4k so the device can

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.560 
the ability to do 4k so the device can
scale<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.909> from<00:02:06.149> HD

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
scale with you as you go from HD

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
scale with you as you go from HD
projects<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> 2k<00:02:07.649> projects<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.729> up

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
projects to 2k projects all the way up

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.430 
projects to 2k projects all the way up
to<00:02:08.849> 4k<00:02:09.300> projects<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to 4k projects so it really is a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.470 
to 4k projects so it really is a
future-proof<00:02:10.830> device

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
future-proof device

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.630 
future-proof device

replacement<00:02:37.910> key<00:02:38.540> pro<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.959> evolving<00:02:39.410> that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
replacement key pro was evolving that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.979 
replacement key pro was evolving that
way<00:02:39.799> but<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.579> have<00:02:40.700> key<00:02:41.180> pro<00:02:41.420> rack<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.930> it

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
way but now we have key pro rack and it

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.809 
way but now we have key pro rack and it
really<00:02:42.230> fits<00:02:42.560> right<00:02:42.799> in<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.129> a<00:02:43.159> deck<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.640> has

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
really fits right in as a deck it has

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.460 
really fits right in as a deck it has
all<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.750> connections<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.349> would

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
all the connections that you would

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.670 
all the connections that you would
expect<00:02:45.799> from<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.160> particular<00:02:46.730> VTR<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:48.500> can

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
expect from a particular VTR you can

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.289 
expect from a particular VTR you can
plug<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.129> right<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.819> uses<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.180> same

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
plug it right in it uses the same

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.860 
plug it right in it uses the same
cabling<00:02:50.989> AES<00:02:51.500> audio<00:02:51.920> 422<00:02:52.879> control<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:53.810> it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
cabling AES audio 422 control so it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.539 
cabling AES audio 422 control so it
really<00:02:54.079> is<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.290> file-based<00:02:54.680> deck<00:02:55.280> replacement

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
really is a file-based deck replacement

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.330 
really is a file-based deck replacement
a<00:02:56.030> very<00:02:56.299> powerful<00:02:56.480> product<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.220> it's

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
a very powerful product and I think it's

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.710 
a very powerful product and I think it's
going<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.489> be<00:02:58.549> really<00:02:58.819> popular<00:02:59.090> with<00:02:59.359> a<00:02:59.480> lot<00:02:59.569> of

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
going to be really popular with a lot of

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.680 
going to be really popular with a lot of
folks<00:03:00.019> in<00:03:00.140> facilities
