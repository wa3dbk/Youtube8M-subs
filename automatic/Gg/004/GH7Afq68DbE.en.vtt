sophistic<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> title<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.229> time<00:01:43.380> I'm

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
sophistic to the title so this time I'm

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.719 
sophistic to the title so this time I'm
going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> give<00:01:43.860> everyone<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> potential<00:01:44.700> of

going to give everyone a potential of

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.240 
going to give everyone a potential of
minus<00:01:45.119> 9<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:45.689> means<00:01:45.990> their<00:01:46.680> potential<00:01:47.130> can

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
minus 9 which means their potential can

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
minus 9 which means their potential can
reach<00:01:47.399> between<00:01:47.640> 180<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.509> 200<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
reach between 180 and 200 which is the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
reach between 180 and 200 which is the
highest<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:49.950> possibly<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
highest you can possibly get and the
