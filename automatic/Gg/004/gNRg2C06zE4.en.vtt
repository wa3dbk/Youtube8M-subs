00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 I can not patent it will 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.359
 probably not created 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.099
 become 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 it's not just the dandelion that's there 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.790
 value would be exactly in the lab and the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.860
 clinical studies 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.520
 to be taken 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.439
 since there are many other our 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.439
 Central European plant world knows 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.310
 alone over 1500 flowering plants of it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.779
 are about 400 traditional medicinal plants 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.170
 a few dozen are good 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.170
 documented 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 the potential is great not only in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.070
 beauty and diversity but also in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 Healing power is not further researched 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 you can not find anything anymore and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.510
 At some point, our knowledge is reduced 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.469
 on a few bestsellers like 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.480
 Johanna chamomile and hawthorn but 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.480
 Diversity is not only in the rainforest 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.400
 he cares for example and the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.899
 wild mallow and who is still researching 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.399
 over iron hat unfortunately reflects the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.729
 Diversity less and less in the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.280
 product range legislative 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.350
 measures and requirements have that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.450
 spectrum of plants remedies in the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.170
 in recent years shrink in half 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.170
 to let 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.770
 I will become a favorite medicinal plant 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.400
 again from my patients 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.570
 asked is the lavender among other things 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.790
 because he breaks beautifully and because he does 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.240
 is straightforward and also grows in 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.860
 my garden by the way lavender is 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.180
 By the way, a medicinal plant with a whole 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.950
 great potential 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.470
 I know that was instant on the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.860
 lavender very intensively researched 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.290
 becomes 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.229
 if you can do it externally internally 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.810
 Apply the oil, you can inhale that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.090
 is so enormous 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 this plant fascinates me 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.750
 Maybe everything has it 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.440
 started 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.390
 somebody has in prehistoric 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.670
 time leaves and flowers from the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.100
 current offer of nature with hot 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.840
 water poured 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.110
 what is it but planting? 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.170
 remedies in always newer 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.659
 drug combination 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:31.849
 the fascination is still working 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:34.010
 today enjoy that for that is that 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.870
 really an experience in nature around 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.819
 Run the herbs for the gathering and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.659
 the tea after that drown it one 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.950
 experience yes you can not do anything yes 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.450
 You can do that between rust or or 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.090
 By some you can say that 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.500
 not reflect what the children because 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.489
 witnessed and give this with 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.040
 I keep on playing safety 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.599
 much better then but that's almost it 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.599
 also heinz richter 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.720
 The big trend and chamomile is pure 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.500
 and blind flowers and do not leaf 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.569
 Young Peter you can really great 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:33.320
 sleep nor drink bellyache all the 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:35.030
 healthy delicious smells of chamomile flowers there 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.340
 There are strong differences in salary 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.220
 essential oils and thus theirs 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.760
 Efficiency simple foods 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.440
 Chamomile is often of low quality 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.520
 Best one buys high quality 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.520
 Goods in the pharmacy 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.410
 the loose flower heads are suitable for 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.210
 a whole series of fragrant applications 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:23.480
 inhaling the vapor is a very 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.500
 effective medium for the sneeze 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.270
 natural remedies will be there alone 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.700
 the time so that you take the time 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.200
 take more together and prepare something 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.120
 in front 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.800
 he is just there and that is 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.470
 easy 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.120
 Merck has time together and who will 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.650
 then automatically healthy if someone 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.760
 there we are all around it 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.760
 just makes makes us fun 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.000
 baldrian melissa lavender and hops 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:06:00.360
 are suitable additions for one 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.820
 it is also a bath for experts 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.250
 has not yet clarified one 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.170
 organically grown structure others 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.370
 Qualities as a synthetic 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.370
 produced connection 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.510
 most pharmacists and doctors 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.550
 suspect that the whole thing is more 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.550
 is as the sum of its parts 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.190
 is more complicated if you are with with the 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.120
 nature works it is definitely 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.060
 more elaborate and you need more time 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.090
 but it is really for the kids 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.159
 important that you take the time he 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.810
 you can quickly find antibiotic 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.030
 or something grab it's just less 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.150
 work it is certainly more comfortable 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.220
 if you do not have time but it pays 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.690
 It definitely pays off 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.690
 from what you have to the children 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.000
 if a child has died this 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.319
 on it is the pain on it 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.849
 actually flown away because it 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:14.659
 simply interesting is ne onion on 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:16.819
 to have a hand and I think so 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.380
 these are all enough this erlebnisse 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:22.280
 how to just share together 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.050
 but shows we do that now if 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.569
 one the onion on it one hold fast 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.129
 you can help me 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.289
 maybe the plants have medicine yes 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:32.949
 also completely different qualities 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:37.069
 it goes along with slowing down 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:39.370
 Attention and mindfulness a healing 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:39.370
 path
