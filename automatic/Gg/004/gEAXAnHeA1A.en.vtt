 Slavic eugenio fusco 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.330
 I had as a suspension 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:36.660
 for time and space a kind of 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:42.030
 immanent ecstasy and in front of the bar 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:46.020
 poke of this body of Slavic god e 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.570
 Greek in front of the mix of music 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.979
 wonderful and I thought I thought but 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.759
 how was it possible for someone 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:03.450
 planned to make the Russian people 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.240
 a people of slaves dear friends as it is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.350
 all this was possible 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.400
 I took a look at the biography of 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.550
 this Slavic god and Greek god in the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.790
 same time and saw so it comes 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.220
 from a modest family and who owes everything 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.350
 to the interest of his most humid 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 mother the father of this eugenio kushenko 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:36.600
 he was a carpenters they had understood moms 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.350
 dad and this young their children and who 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.730
 he had some talent but they didn't know 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.200
 as equal to one point the mother 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:53.970

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.790
 of the figure skating star 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.410
 the ice and this great fear 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.260
 use among young people with his son the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.470
 young grew up becoming a 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.340
 world champion 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.310
 then it was later on to the races 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.980
 Olympics of ancient Greece 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.290
 I think of the following races woods balls 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:26.310
 that I also think about what poetry is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.410
 I talked about it many times today 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.290
 poetry is expected that forms from the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:41.670
 poetry are transformed over time 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.790
 madness arises at the time of humerus and when 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.660
 the writing was still in the state 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.350
 rising forms of poetry today I have it 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.310
 said so many times they will merge 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.459
 free formats with creation poetry 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.910
 which then has the word poetry refers to the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.489
 Greek word reaction form and sublimates 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.880
