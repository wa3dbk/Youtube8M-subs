all right I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:03.049> basically<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.200> change<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
do a basically how to change the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.500 
do a basically how to change the
thermostat<00:00:05.089> on<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:07.040> mk3<00:00:08.069> jetta<00:00:08.880> golf<00:00:09.240> whatever

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
thermostat on a mk3 jetta golf whatever

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.879 
thermostat on a mk3 jetta golf whatever
it<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.960> 2.0<00:00:10.650> ABA<00:00:11.010> motor<00:00:12.590> firstly<00:00:13.590> 30

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it is 2.0 ABA motor firstly 30

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.420 
it is 2.0 ABA motor firstly 30
millimeter<00:00:14.370> wrench

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
millimeter wrench

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.950 
millimeter wrench
you'll<00:00:17.430> basically<00:00:17.609> go<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.390> you'll<00:00:18.720> put

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
you'll basically go up here you'll put

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.120 
you'll basically go up here you'll put
it<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.289> tension<00:00:19.590> right<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
it on this tension right here it's the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.980 
it on this tension right here it's the
only<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.430> that's<00:00:20.550> smooth<00:00:20.880> you'll<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
only one that's smooth you'll see the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.490 
only one that's smooth you'll see the
difference

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
difference

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.990 
difference
that's<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> good<00:00:23.220> Bell<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.490> already<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:23.970> just

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that's a good Bell off already but just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.759 
that's a good Bell off already but just
to<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> hint<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
to get the hint and then you want to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.560 
to get the hint and then you want to
pull<00:00:25.949> pull<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.580> forward<00:00:26.910> towards<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> car<00:00:27.420> hit

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
pull pull it forward towards the car hit

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.550 
pull pull it forward towards the car hit
longer<00:00:27.810> wrench<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> works<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> lot<00:00:28.500> better

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
longer wrench it works a lot better

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
longer wrench it works a lot better
because<00:00:28.920> you're<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.250> leverage<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.330> you'll

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
because you're more leverage but you'll

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.250 
because you're more leverage but you'll
see<00:00:31.050> how<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.230> moves<00:00:32.270> you'll<00:00:33.270> move<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.989> far

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
see how it moves you'll move it as far

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.080 
see how it moves you'll move it as far
back<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.800> till<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> tension<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.910> off

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
back as you can till the tension is off

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
back as you can till the tension is off
the<00:00:36.420> belt<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> off<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> then

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the belt then you take it off and then

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.790 
the belt then you take it off and then
you<00:00:37.860> let<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.579> we'll<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.790> back<00:00:42.800> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you let go of that and we'll go back the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
you let go of that and we'll go back the
next<00:00:44.160> step<00:00:44.450> is<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.629> mean<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> course<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.140> need<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
next step is I mean of course you need a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.799 
next step is I mean of course you need a
jack<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> car<00:00:47.750> um<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.940> next<00:00:51.120> step<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
jack up the car um the next step is you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:09.859 
jack up the car um the next step is you
can<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.410> two<00:01:07.700> okay<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> the

can actually have two okay this is the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
can actually have two okay this is the
power<00:01:10.080> steering<00:01:10.380> pump<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.600> remove

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
power steering pump you have to remove

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it goes like into the block to the oil

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:34.020 
it goes like into the block to the oil
pan

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030

you can see all right so now that's fun

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.990 
you can see all right so now that's fun
where<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.799> thermostat<00:02:04.250> housing<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.789> it's

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
where the thermostat housing is it's

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.279 
where the thermostat housing is it's
right<00:02:05.149> here<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.340> two<00:02:07.549> 10<00:02:07.789> millimeter

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
right here so it's two 10 millimeter

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.860 
right here so it's two 10 millimeter
bolts<00:02:09.289> just<00:02:09.880> know<00:02:10.880> right<00:02:10.910> when<00:02:11.329> you<00:02:11.450> undo<00:02:11.690> this

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
bolts just know right when you undo this

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.979 
bolts just know right when you undo this
a<00:02:12.250> lot<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.459> antifreeze<00:02:14.329> is<00:02:14.630> going<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.810> start

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
a lot of antifreeze is going to start

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:15.809 
a lot of antifreeze is going to start
coming<00:02:15.170> out

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
coming out

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.920 
coming out
so<00:02:16.819> let's<00:02:16.970> come<00:02:17.060> leak<00:02:17.209> everywhere<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:17.810> make

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
so let's come leak everywhere so make

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.900 
so let's come leak everywhere so make
sure<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.079> have<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> catch<00:02:18.410> can<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:19.700> going

to<00:02:27.680> get<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.920> power<00:02:28.099> step<00:02:28.430> /<00:02:29.530> steering<00:02:30.530> pump<00:02:30.769> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
to get the power step / steering pump to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.860 
to get the power step / steering pump to
rest<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:34.360> for<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.450> day<00:02:35.569> while<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.750> was

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
rest like this for the day while I was

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.340 
rest like this for the day while I was
like<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.410> push<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.609> pulley<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
like this I push this pulley up it's the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.140 
like this I push this pulley up it's the
corn<00:02:39.560> right<00:02:39.680> here<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.730> when<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:40.880> did<00:02:41.030> that

there's one wasn't working is because

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.969
