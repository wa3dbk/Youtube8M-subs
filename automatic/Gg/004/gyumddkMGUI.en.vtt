export little kids would love this my

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.750 
export little kids would love this my
look<00:01:38.480> at<00:01:38.600> me<00:01:38.750> if<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:39.380> push<00:01:39.560> both<00:01:39.830> buttons<00:01:39.890> it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
look at me if you push both buttons it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.910 
look at me if you push both buttons it
takes<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.120> screenshot<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:41.960> that's<00:01:42.500> built<00:01:42.800> in

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
takes a screenshot but that's built in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.250 
takes a screenshot but that's built in
the<00:01:42.979> OS<00:01:43.250> every<00:01:43.580> yeah<00:01:43.820> it'd<00:01:44.000> be<00:01:44.119> cool<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:45.080> only

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
the OS every yeah it'd be cool the only

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.109 
the OS every yeah it'd be cool the only
actually<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.010> only<00:01:46.100> improvements<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.790> would

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
actually the only improvements I would

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.850 
actually the only improvements I would
think<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.450> developer<00:01:47.900> can<00:01:48.020> make<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.530> is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
think the developer can make on this is

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.480 
think the developer can make on this is
a<00:01:49.130> built-in<00:01:49.970> thing<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.270> do<00:01:50.360> screenshots<00:01:50.900> and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
a built-in thing to do screenshots and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.620 
a built-in thing to do screenshots and
save<00:01:52.490> them<00:01:52.670> an<00:01:52.760> email<00:01:52.880> because<00:01:53.270> it's<00:01:53.450> real

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
save them an email because it's real

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.740 
save them an email because it's real
easy<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:53.869> do<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:55.610> your<00:01:56.210> screenshot<00:01:56.630> which

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
easy to do and your screenshot which

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.580 
easy to do and your screenshot which
still<00:01:56.960> line<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.110> code<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:58.220> um<00:01:59.590> maybe

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
still line a code and then um maybe

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.350 
still line a code and then um maybe
other<00:02:00.890> choices<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.430> mean<00:02:01.580> it's<00:02:01.850> cool<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.090> it

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
other choices I mean it's cool that it

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.090 
other choices I mean it's cool that it
