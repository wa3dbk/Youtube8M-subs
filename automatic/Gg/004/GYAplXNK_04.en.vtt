works<00:00:21.360> without<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.720> roof<00:00:22.099> I'm<00:00:23.099> bit<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
works without the roof I'm bit of a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.560 
works without the roof I'm bit of a
sucker<00:00:23.669> I<00:00:23.849> mean<00:00:24.000> you're<00:00:24.119> gonna<00:00:24.210> hear<00:00:24.450> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
sucker I mean you're gonna hear the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300 
sucker I mean you're gonna hear the
engine<00:00:24.869> noise<00:00:25.020> more<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.860> looks<00:00:26.099> good

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
engine noise more but it it looks good

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.580 
engine noise more but it it looks good
without<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.759> roof<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.689> cars<00:00:27.990> he<00:00:28.110> can't<00:00:28.380> lift

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
without the roof some cars he can't lift

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
without the roof some cars he can't lift
the<00:00:28.740> roof<00:00:28.919> off<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.579> this<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> think

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the roof off but with this one I think

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
the roof off but with this one I think
it<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.570> enhances<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.140> whole<00:00:31.320> experience

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it just enhances a whole experience

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.850 
it just enhances a whole experience
firstly<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.879> its<00:00:33.059> personal<00:00:33.480> opinion<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.350> think

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
firstly in its personal opinion I think

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.299 
firstly in its personal opinion I think
it's<00:00:35.610> far<00:00:36.300> better<00:00:36.480> than<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.900> coupe<00:00:37.080> a<00:00:37.320> twin

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
it's far better than the coupe a twin

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.890 
it's far better than the coupe a twin
panel<00:00:38.699> target<00:00:39.530> stowaway<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> boots<00:00:41.900> and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
panel target stowaway in the boots and

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.420 
panel target stowaway in the boots and
did<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.230> say<00:00:43.410> you've<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.800> got<00:00:43.949> that<00:00:43.980> noise

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
did you say you've just got that noise

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.549 
did you say you've just got that noise
which<00:00:45.150> Lamborghini<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.080> all<00:00:46.199> about<00:00:46.409> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
which Lamborghini is all about that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.289 
which Lamborghini is all about that
sensation<00:00:47.159> you're<00:00:47.699> gonna<00:00:47.820> save<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.089> lot<00:00:48.269> of

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
sensation you're gonna save a lot of

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:49.700 
sensation you're gonna save a lot of
weight<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.720> well<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.019> you<00:00:49.110> haven't<00:00:49.290> got<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
weight as well if you haven't got the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.829 
weight as well if you haven't got the
motors<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.489> servos<00:00:50.699> controlling<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> roof

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
motors and servos controlling the roof

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.539 
motors and servos controlling the roof
as<00:00:52.049> well<00:00:52.080> you<00:00:52.470> don't<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.799> the<00:00:52.920> complications

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
as well you don't have the complications

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.340 
as well you don't have the complications
of<00:00:53.580> that<00:00:53.640> mechanism<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.869> pretty<00:00:55.019> pure

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of that mechanism so it's pretty pure

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
of that mechanism so it's pretty pure
isn't<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.860> guess<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.489> pure<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.150> carbon

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
isn't it I guess it's pure the carbon

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
isn't it I guess it's pure the carbon
slab<00:00:57.839> keeps<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:58.710> rigid<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.549> you've<00:01:00.030> not

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
slab keeps it very rigid so you've not

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
slab keeps it very rigid so you've not
lost<00:01:00.360> well<00:01:01.019> you've<00:01:01.290> lost<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.650> little<00:01:01.860> bit<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
lost well you've lost a little bit of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.890 
lost well you've lost a little bit of
rigidity<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.970> nothing<00:01:03.330> like<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.540> got<00:01:03.750> on

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
rigidity but nothing like this got on

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.210 
rigidity but nothing like this got on

front<00:04:03.220> number<00:04:03.400> plate<00:04:03.730> on<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:04.000> can<00:04:04.209> you

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
front number plate on it can you

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.259 
front number plate on it can you
properly<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:05.620> if<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.340> had<00:04:06.609> one<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:06.879> certainly

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
properly and if I had one I certainly

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.640
