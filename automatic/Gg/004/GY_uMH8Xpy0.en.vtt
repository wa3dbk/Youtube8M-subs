00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.079
Meet the slime mold

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.570
from out of the year they live as single cells, but in autumn they come together a

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.059
relentless shape-shifting yellow goo that scours the forest for bacterial film.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.169
The slime mold eats anything that gets in its path, devouring mulch and decaying matter.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.749
This blob provides an essential service in cleaning up our woodlands.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.549
Despite lacking an apparent nose it hones in on its prey a white fungus.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.960
Now that we've chosen to take all we can.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.400
A shade of autumn, still bitter end.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.800
Here the rest we shall lay down side by side.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.960
And it's only you who can tell me apart.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.980
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.500
When all food is gone. They have a trick up their sleeve.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.018
A coordinated effort in mass reproduction.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.529
How this colonial creature determines who does what is anyone's guess.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.549
Yet, some cells form stems other cells form spores.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.839
And the slime molds tiny cells are scattered.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.179
Ready to spring into action when the good times return.
