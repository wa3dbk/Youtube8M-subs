tried this on my own naturally curly
hair<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.649> find<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.490> don't<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
hair and I find that I don't like the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.440 
hair and I find that I don't like the
results<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:52.049> i<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.189> prepare<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.149> be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
results because i like my prepare to be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.319 
results because i like my prepare to be
straight<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.100> curled<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
straight and then curled because then it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
straight and then curled because then it
looks<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:58.049> smoother<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.040> all

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
looks just a lot smoother right here all

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
looks just a lot smoother right here all
i'm<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.880> using<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.719> spray
