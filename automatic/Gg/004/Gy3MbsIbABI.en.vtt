difficult to see the 3d here with the
single<00:02:37.239> lens<00:02:37.420> because<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.810> requires<00:02:38.140> two<00:02:38.470> uh

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500

two eyes of course like your human human
eyes<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.430> were<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.579> take<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> very

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
eyes but if I were to take the very

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.220 
eyes but if I were to take the very
first<00:02:43.060> shot<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.720> through<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.989> shutter

button up here I push halfway down and

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.960 
button up here I push halfway down and

zoom<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.420> zoom<00:02:49.480> out<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.170> camera<00:02:50.530> does<00:02:50.709> have

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
zoom in zoom out so the camera does have

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.430 
zoom in zoom out so the camera does have

a three times optical zoom lens okay you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.990 
a three times optical zoom lens okay you
want<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.739> careful<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.579> your<00:02:54.700> fingers

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
don't go in front of the lens otherwise

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.559 
don't go in front of the lens otherwise
you<00:02:57.069> can<00:02:57.220> see<00:02:57.400> low<00:02:57.579> blurriness<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.269> front

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
you can see low blurriness in front

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.509 
you can see low blurriness in front
there<00:02:58.780> as<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:58.989> can<00:02:59.019> see<00:02:59.170> my<00:02:59.950> hands<00:03:00.280> are<00:03:00.370> being

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
there as you can see my hands are being

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.259 
there as you can see my hands are being
put<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.879> front

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
put in front

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.640 
put in front
so<00:03:01.840> again<00:03:02.019> zooming<00:03:02.409> out<00:03:04.140> put<00:03:05.140> my<00:03:05.260> hands<00:03:05.560> in

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
so again zooming out put my hands in

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.670 
so again zooming out put my hands in
front<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.159> can<00:03:06.280> see<00:03:06.359> has<00:03:07.359> a<00:03:07.390> little<00:03:08.170> bit<00:03:08.319> blood

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.530 
front you can see has a little bit blood
now<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> doesn't<00:03:09.459> look<00:03:09.609> properly<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.390> back

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
now it doesn't look properly on the back

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.390 
now it doesn't look properly on the back
of<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.750> screen<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.200> because<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.859> screen<00:03:12.370> is

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
of the screen is because the screen is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.789 
of the screen is because the screen is
displayed<00:03:12.879> 3d<00:03:13.359> but<00:03:13.930> if<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.049> push<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.409> 2d

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
displayed 3d but if I push this 2d

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.399 
displayed 3d but if I push this 2d
button<00:03:15.209> becomes<00:03:16.209> 2d<00:03:16.569> now<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> lot<00:03:17.019> easier

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
button becomes 2d now it's a lot easier

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.670 
button becomes 2d now it's a lot easier
for<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.650> actually<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.099> see<00:03:19.200> which<00:03:20.200> lens<00:03:20.500> it's

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
for you actually to see which lens it's

for you actually to see which lens it's
coming<00:03:20.980> from<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.370> come<00:03:21.549> from<00:03:21.669> the<00:03:21.819> left

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
coming from so it come from the left

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.360 
coming from so it come from the left
lens<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.139> tick<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.380> 2d<00:03:23.680> image<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.069> can<00:03:24.220> just

advanced<00:04:53.500> features<00:04:53.880> again<00:04:54.880> zooming<00:04:55.300> it's<00:04:55.419> in

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
advanced features again zooming it's in

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.390 
advanced features again zooming it's in
and<00:04:55.840> out<00:04:57.750> when<00:04:58.750> shooting<00:04:59.080> 3d<00:04:59.319> of<00:04:59.560> course<00:04:59.830> if<00:05:00.280> I

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
and out when shooting 3d of course if I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.830 
and out when shooting 3d of course if I
just<00:05:00.520> go<00:05:00.610> back<00:05:00.759> to<00:05:00.909> the<00:05:01.030> auto<00:05:01.180> mode<00:05:01.449> and<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.690> take

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
just go back to the auto mode and I take

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.809 
just go back to the auto mode and I take
a<00:05:01.870> snapshot<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:03.130> don't<00:05:03.310> like<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.580> way<00:05:03.669> it

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
a snapshot and I don't like the way it

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.510 
a snapshot and I don't like the way it
looks<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:05.020> screen<00:05:05.349> I<00:05:05.560> can<00:05:05.889> adjust<00:05:06.400> the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
looks on the screen I can adjust the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.670 
looks on the screen I can adjust the
parallax<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.449> by<00:05:07.569> using<00:05:07.870> this<00:05:08.080> parallax

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
parallax of it by using this parallax

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.559 
parallax of it by using this parallax
control<00:05:09.159> and<00:05:09.520> I'm<00:05:09.940> not<00:05:10.060> sure<00:05:10.180> if<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.330> can<00:05:10.419> see

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
control and I'm not sure if you can see

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.300 
control and I'm not sure if you can see
this<00:05:10.690> on<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.870> screen<00:05:11.139> or<00:05:11.259> not<00:05:11.289> when<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.009> do<00:05:12.099> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
this on the screen or not when I do the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.309 
this on the screen or not when I do the
up<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.940> know<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.120> edit<00:05:13.389> shooting<00:05:13.690> 3d<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.139> let<00:05:14.259> me

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
up you know I edit shooting 3d so let me

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.029 
up you know I edit shooting 3d so let me
shoot<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.710> 3d<00:05:15.599> there<00:05:16.599> we<00:05:16.720> go<00:05:16.840> it's<00:05:17.050> 3d<00:05:17.380> ok

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
shoot that in 3d there we go it's 3d ok

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.520 
shoot that in 3d there we go it's 3d ok
back<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.370> image<00:05:18.930> now<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:19.960> see<00:05:20.169> that<00:05:20.319> sort<00:05:20.440> of

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
back the image now you see that sort of

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.469 
back the image now you see that sort of
double<00:05:20.830> image<00:05:21.099> right<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:21.970> if<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.120> trying<00:05:22.389> to

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
double image right so if I trying to

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.879 
double image right so if I trying to
change<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.810> parallax<00:05:23.199> you<00:05:23.349> can<00:05:23.470> see<00:05:23.620> it<00:05:23.710> sort

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
change the parallax you can see it sort

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.890 
change the parallax you can see it sort
of<00:05:23.979> sliding<00:05:24.280> left<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.789> right<00:05:24.970> I'm<00:05:25.330> gonna<00:05:25.659> just

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
of sliding left and right I'm gonna just

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.200 
of sliding left and right I'm gonna just
a<00:05:26.020> parallax<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:26.590> they<00:05:26.710> match<00:05:26.949> boom<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.580> now<00:05:28.180> I

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
a parallax so they match boom and now I

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.629 
a parallax so they match boom and now I
have<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.509> proper<00:05:29.080> 3d<00:05:29.440> image<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.949> course<00:05:30.400> you

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
have a proper 3d image of course you

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.370 
have a proper 3d image of course you
can't<00:05:30.880> see<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.150> on<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.330> screen<00:05:31.509> but<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:32.110> have

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
can't see it on the screen but you have

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.140 
can't see it on the screen but you have
to<00:05:32.469> look<00:05:32.560> at<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.740> camera<00:05:33.070> live<00:05:33.250> so<00:05:34.000> that's

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
to look at the camera live so that's

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.430 
to look at the camera live so that's
just<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.389> quick<00:05:34.509> look<00:05:34.780> on<00:05:34.930> how<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.110> get<00:05:35.289> this

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
just a quick look on how to get this

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.649 
just a quick look on how to get this
camera<00:05:35.800> up<00:05:35.979> and<00:05:36.130> running<00:05:36.490> again<00:05:36.580> it's<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:37.060> Fuji

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
camera up and running again it's a Fuji

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:42.389 
camera up and running again it's a Fuji
3d<00:05:38.139> W<00:05:38.830> 3<00:05:39.070> camera<00:05:39.490> from<00:05:39.969> Fuji
