like<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.019> original<00:04:15.439> kindle<00:04:15.829> for<00:04:16.220> cosmetic

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
like the original kindle for cosmetic

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.270 
like the original kindle for cosmetic
reasons<00:04:17.000> i<00:04:17.539> know<00:04:17.599> it's<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.109> very<00:04:18.320> poor<00:04:18.769> reason

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
reasons i know it's a very poor reason

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.200 
reasons i know it's a very poor reason
to<00:04:19.519> not<00:04:19.759> like<00:04:19.789> something<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.630> i'm<00:04:21.199> fickle<00:04:21.829> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
to not like something but i'm fickle and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.050 
to not like something but i'm fickle and
so<00:04:23.229> when<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.409> new<00:04:24.770> kindle<00:04:24.979> two<00:04:25.430> came<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:25.849> i

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
so when the new kindle two came out i

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.360 
so when the new kindle two came out i
was<00:04:26.210> much<00:04:26.960> impressed<00:04:27.650> with<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.039> new<00:04:28.070> design

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
was much impressed with the new design

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.399 
was much impressed with the new design
and<00:04:28.520> i<00:04:28.789> think<00:04:29.000> actually<00:04:29.750> I'm<00:04:30.110> even<00:04:30.380> more

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
and i think actually I'm even more

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.279 
and i think actually I'm even more
impressed<00:04:30.650> with<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.280> DX<00:04:31.789> because<00:04:32.389> I<00:04:32.690> think

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
impressed with the DX because I think

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.050 
impressed with the DX because I think
it's<00:04:33.409> the<00:04:33.500> right<00:04:33.680> size<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:34.400> think<00:04:34.699> that<00:04:34.880> if

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
it's the right size I think that if

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.399 
it's the right size I think that if
you're<00:04:35.240> going<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.419> get<00:04:35.509> something<00:04:35.780> pocket<00:04:36.320> of

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
you're going to get something pocket of

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.020 
you're going to get something pocket of

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
all you might as well use your iPhone to

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.390 
all you might as well use your iPhone to
cause<00:04:38.360> an<00:04:38.509> e-book<00:04:38.719> reader<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.159> really
