she's a female Raiden which was never
the<00:00:24.369> intention<00:00:24.730> but<00:00:25.150> I<00:00:25.390> think<00:00:25.720> it's<00:00:25.810> because

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
the intention but I think it's because

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.010 
the intention but I think it's because
she<00:00:26.259> had<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.710> whole<00:00:26.860> white<00:00:27.669> garment<00:00:28.239> on<00:00:28.390> and<00:00:28.779> a

Raiden<00:00:31.509> which<00:00:31.960> was<00:00:32.619> wrong<00:00:32.860> she's<00:00:33.460> probably

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
Raiden which was wrong she's probably

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.939
