fact<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.210> hype<00:01:36.390> will<00:01:36.570> never<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.990> fulfilled

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
fact that hype will never be fulfilled

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
fact that hype will never be fulfilled
but<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> other<00:01:38.250> reason<00:01:38.579> why<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.000> being

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but the other reason why it's being

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
but the other reason why it's being
released<00:01:39.479> late<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.590> actually

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
released late is because it's actually

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.880 
released late is because it's actually
being<00:01:41.340> made<00:01:41.670> by<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> different<00:01:42.600> studio<00:01:42.990> why

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
being made by a different studio why

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
being made by a different studio why
would<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.579> want<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> play<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> game<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
would you want to play a game that it's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
would you want to play a game that it's
sure<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> same<00:01:46.740> game<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.880> being

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
sure it's the same game but it's being

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.080 
sure it's the same game but it's being
made<00:01:48.479> by<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> different<00:01:49.110> studio<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
made by a different studio this is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
made by a different studio this is
hugely<00:01:51.380> concerning<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> me<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> different

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
hugely concerning to me that a different

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.999 
hugely concerning to me that a different
studio<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.030> having<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> basically<00:01:54.770> remake<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
game for the xbox 360 that is just

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.639 
game for the xbox 360 that is just
terribly<00:01:59.310> concerning<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.270> may<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.750> completely

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
terribly concerning it may be completely

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
terribly concerning it may be completely
a<00:02:01.680> different<00:02:01.770> game<00:02:02.670> by<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> time<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.810> actually

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
a different game by the time it actually

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.590 
a different game by the time it actually
comes<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:05.670> something<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
comes out but then something that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.010 
comes out but then something that
further<00:02:07.020> amazes<00:02:07.860> me

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
further amazes me

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.250 
further amazes me
is<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.650> way<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.190> xbox<00:02:10.640> one<00:02:11.150> now<00:02:11.720> comes

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
is the way that the xbox one now comes

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.140 
is the way that the xbox one now comes
with<00:02:12.560> titanfall<00:02:13.130> it's<00:02:13.460> almost<00:02:13.880> as<00:02:14.120> though

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
with titanfall it's almost as though

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.960 
with titanfall it's almost as though

telling me that the xbox one install

which is over 20 gigabytes but the xbox

which is over 20 gigabytes but the xbox
360<00:02:37.520> install<00:02:37.940> titanfall<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.600> going<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.050> be<00:02:39.230> at

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
360 install titanfall is going to be at

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.560 
360 install titanfall is going to be at
below<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.700> half<00:02:40.730> gigs<00:02:41.240> which<00:02:41.420> is

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
below one and a half gigs which is

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.100 
below one and a half gigs which is
basically<00:02:42.520> 118th<00:02:43.520> of<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.000> game<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.990> the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
basically 118th of the game that the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.990 
basically 118th of the game that the
other<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.440> if<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.770> look<00:02:45.920> at<00:02:46.070> install

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
other one is if you look at install

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.100 
other one is if you look at install
numbers<00:02:47.450> that's<00:02:48.400> ridiculously<00:02:49.400> worse<00:02:49.910> now<00:02:50.450> do

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
numbers that's ridiculously worse now do

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.360 
numbers that's ridiculously worse now do
I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> graphics<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.100> going<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.280> be

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
I think the graphics are going to be

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.190 
I think the graphics are going to be
just<00:02:52.490> terribly<00:02:53.090> bad<00:02:53.330> no<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.660> think<00:02:53.810> they'll<00:02:54.050> be

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
just terribly bad no I think they'll be

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.350 
just terribly bad no I think they'll be
on<00:02:54.230> par<00:02:54.680> with<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.160> call<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.760> duty<00:02:55.790> ghosts

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
on par with you know call of duty ghosts

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.750 
on par with you know call of duty ghosts
and<00:02:56.480> whatnot<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.680> point<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.400> not

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and whatnot but the point is it's not

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.090 
and whatnot but the point is it's not
gonna<00:02:59.090> be<00:02:59.450> some<00:02:59.870> killer<00:03:00.260> good<00:03:00.560> game<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:00.860> I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
gonna be some killer good game and I

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.470 
gonna be some killer good game and I
think<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:01.490> going<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.640> head<00:03:01.880> down<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.270> same

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
think it's going to head down the same

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.050 
think it's going to head down the same
path<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.870> he'll<00:03:03.770> afforded<00:03:04.460> you<00:03:04.820> know<00:03:04.880> what

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
path that he'll afforded you know what

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.790 
path that he'll afforded you know what
just<00:03:05.120> happened<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.480> halo<00:03:05.690> 4<00:03:05.990> lately<00:03:06.320> is<00:03:06.380> its

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
just happened to halo 4 lately is its

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.370 
just happened to halo 4 lately is its
hit<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> record<00:03:07.820> low<00:03:08.390> player<00:03:08.930> numbers

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
hit like a record low player numbers

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.520 
hit like a record low player numbers
like<00:03:09.730> halo<00:03:10.730> reach<00:03:11.030> could<00:03:11.420> possibly<00:03:11.990> have<00:03:12.200> more

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
like halo reach could possibly have more

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.949 
like halo reach could possibly have more
players<00:03:12.830> than<00:03:12.980> halo<00:03:13.280> 4<00:03:13.640> halo<00:03:14.270> 4<00:03:14.330> has<00:03:14.660> kind<00:03:14.900> of

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
been forgotten and I think a lot of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.940 
been forgotten and I think a lot of
people<00:03:35.330> forgot<00:03:35.690> about<00:03:35.870> halo<00:03:36.080> 4<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.410> didn't<00:03:36.740> like

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
people forgot about halo 4 I didn't like

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.190 
people forgot about halo 4 I didn't like
halo<00:03:37.220> 4<00:03:37.550> I<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:38.270> titan<00:03:38.570> falls<00:03:38.720> end<00:03:38.990> up<00:03:39.080> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
halo 4 I think titan falls end up the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.350 
halo 4 I think titan falls end up the
same<00:03:39.230> way<00:03:39.440> as<00:03:39.709> halo<00:03:39.890> 4<00:03:40.190> but<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:41.000> biggest

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
same way as halo 4 but the biggest

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.750 
same way as halo 4 but the biggest
concern<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.290> why<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.760> there<00:03:44.120> an<00:03:44.620> online-only

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
concern is why is there an online-only

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.740 
concern is why is there an online-only
game<00:03:46.760> on<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.860> nine-year-old<00:03:48.860> council<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:50.270> the
