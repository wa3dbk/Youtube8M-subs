in<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.080> session<00:00:04.290> we're<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.830> talk

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
in this session we're going to talk

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.309 
in this session we're going to talk
about<00:00:05.040> pattern<00:00:05.759> holders<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.480> gobo

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
about pattern holders and gobo

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.610 
about pattern holders and gobo
orientation<00:00:08.719> from<00:00:09.719> other<00:00:09.929> sessions<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.469> may

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
orientation from other sessions you may

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.749 
orientation from other sessions you may
have<00:00:10.740> learned<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.190> there's<00:00:11.400> two<00:00:11.610> different

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
have learned that there's two different

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.700 
have learned that there's two different
positions<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.929> light<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.530> put

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
positions in a light that you can put

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.820 
positions in a light that you can put
these<00:00:14.150> gobos<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> steel<00:00:16.379> pattern

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
these gobos this is the steel pattern

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
these gobos this is the steel pattern
and<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> steel<00:00:17.789> pattern<00:00:18.119> holder<00:00:18.390> would<00:00:18.510> go<00:00:18.690> in

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and the steel pattern holder would go in

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.099 
and the steel pattern holder would go in
the<00:00:19.189> pattern<00:00:20.189> slot<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.820> then<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.570> also<00:00:21.750> have

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the pattern slot and then we also have

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.560 
the pattern slot and then we also have
the<00:00:22.380> drop<00:00:22.980> an<00:00:23.130> iris<00:00:23.490> slot<00:00:23.699> holder<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the drop an iris slot holder and that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330 
the drop an iris slot holder and that
would<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> slot<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.769> wider<00:00:25.980> slot

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
would go in the slot the wider slot

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.060 
would go in the slot the wider slot
that's<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:26.939> further<00:00:27.180> down<00:00:27.480> from

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
that's a little bit further down from

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.010 
that's a little bit further down from
that<00:00:31.130> now<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.489> put<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.910> pattern<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that now as we put this pattern into the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
that now as we put this pattern into the
light<00:00:34.559> itself<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.160> look<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
light itself if you look at the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.670 
light itself if you look at the
projected<00:00:36.030> images<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.050> an<00:00:37.170> orientation

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
projected images there is an orientation

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.900 
projected images there is an orientation
and<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.100> other<00:00:38.280> words<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> top<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and in other words the top of the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
and in other words the top of the
buildings<00:00:39.210> need<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> top<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
buildings need to be at the top the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.330 
buildings need to be at the top the
bottom<00:00:40.860> parts<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> bottom

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
bottom parts have to be at the bottom

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.490 
bottom parts have to be at the bottom
it's<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.700> easy<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> might<00:00:45.480> look<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's not as easy as it might look the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.400 
it's not as easy as it might look the
optics<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.780> fixture<00:00:48.780> itself<00:00:49.140> will

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
optics of the fixture itself will

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950 
optics of the fixture itself will
actually<00:00:49.590> reverse<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> flip<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> image<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
actually reverse and flip the image so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
actually reverse and flip the image so
that<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.030> some<00:00:54.030> sort<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that if you have a some sort of a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
that if you have a some sort of a
graphics<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.960> put<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.199> properly

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
graphics you have to put it in properly

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.819 
graphics you have to put it in properly
you<00:00:59.100> take<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.969> gobo<00:01:00.690> hold<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.289> against<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you take the gobo hold it up against the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.170 
you take the gobo hold it up against the
screen<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.250> you're<00:01:02.309> projecting<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
screen that you're projecting on and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
screen that you're projecting on and
it's<00:01:03.870> oriented<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> way<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's oriented the way you want it to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.980 
it's oriented the way you want it to
look<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> would<00:01:05.790> flip<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.530> flip<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.740> again

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.140 

put<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> holder<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
put it in the holder and put it in the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.350 
put it in the holder and put it in the
light<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:17.220> comes<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.210> right

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
light and it comes out in the right

gobos<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.140> might<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> use<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> doughnut

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
gobos you might have to use a doughnut

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
gobos you might have to use a doughnut
on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> front<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> light<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> clean<00:01:25.320> up

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
on the front of the light to clean up

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.230 
on the front of the light to clean up
some<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> light<00:01:26.369> stray<00:01:26.700> light<00:01:26.909> beams

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
some of the light stray light beams

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
some of the light stray light beams
because<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.380> lenses<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.549> dirty

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
because the lenses in here can be dirty

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.690 
because the lenses in here can be dirty
or<00:01:30.060> smudgy<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.350> by<00:01:31.860> using<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.220> doughnut<00:01:32.579> it

will<00:01:32.820> clean<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.270> quite<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.930> again<00:01:34.200> we

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
will clean that up quite a bit again we

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.990 
will clean that up quite a bit again we
have<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:34.950> different<00:01:35.130> types<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.640> doughnuts

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
have two different types of doughnuts

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.690 
have two different types of doughnuts
here<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> thick<00:01:38.070> line<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
here we have the thick line which is a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.749 
here we have the thick line which is a
little<00:01:38.939> sturdier<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.640> the
