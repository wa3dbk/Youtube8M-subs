00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.749 
I think that we could do this game we
got<00:05:40.270> this<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.860> gotta<00:05:42.009> focus<00:05:42.219> here<00:05:42.400> because

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
from one of the people that I kill and

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.129 
from one of the people that I kill and
death<00:05:58.449> match<00:05:58.630> so<00:05:59.880> here<00:06:00.880> we<00:06:01.029> go<00:06:01.060> in<00:06:01.630> a<00:06:01.719> matter<00:06:02.020> of

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
death match so here we go in a matter of

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.200 
death match so here we go in a matter of
two<00:06:02.860> seconds<00:06:03.340> hopefully<00:06:03.759> this<00:06:03.909> absorption

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
two seconds hopefully this absorption

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.600 
two seconds hopefully this absorption
stays<00:06:04.569> on<00:06:04.870> okay<00:06:05.020> we<00:06:05.440> got<00:06:05.560> 50<00:06:05.800> seconds<00:06:06.159> of<00:06:06.400> this

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
stays on okay we got 50 seconds of this

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.339 
stays on okay we got 50 seconds of this
absorption<00:06:06.969> left<00:06:07.270> so<00:06:07.419> I<00:06:07.449> think<00:06:07.539> that<00:06:08.110> we

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
absorption left so I think that we

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.850 
absorption left so I think that we
should<00:06:08.380> be<00:06:08.650> fine<00:06:09.099> oh<00:06:09.310> he<00:06:09.490> knows<00:06:09.610> who<00:06:09.759> i<00:06:09.849> am<00:06:10.860> i'm
