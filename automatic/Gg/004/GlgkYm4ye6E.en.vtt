00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
tag and then that goes like that it

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.070 
tag and then that goes like that it
opens<00:05:45.940> like<00:05:46.270> this

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.999 

and<00:05:50.740> we<00:05:51.370> have<00:05:51.729> another<00:05:52.590> large<00:05:53.590> pot<00:05:53.979> over<00:05:54.280> here

and we have another large pot over here

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.950 
and we have another large pot over here
larger<00:05:57.009> pocket<00:05:57.430> here<00:05:57.669> two<00:05:57.909> smaller<00:05:58.330> ones<00:05:58.690> over

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
larger pocket here two smaller ones over

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.119 
larger pocket here two smaller ones over
here<00:05:59.849> and<00:06:00.849> then<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.150> just<00:06:01.180> map<00:06:02.169> them<00:06:02.470> with

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
here and then you just map them with

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:10.589 
here and then you just map them with
your<00:06:03.280> tags<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:07.530> this<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:09.129> border<00:06:10.120> punch<00:06:10.330> and

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
I think it's ek success its own large

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.189 
I think it's ek success its own large
the<00:06:13.330> large<00:06:13.569> circle<00:06:14.310> got<00:06:15.310> two<00:06:15.940> more<00:06:16.150> Tang<00:06:16.870> will

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
the large circle got two more Tang will

the<00:07:39.840> spine<00:07:40.170> so<00:07:40.560> this<00:07:40.740> is<00:07:40.920> what<00:07:41.100> I<00:07:41.130> would<00:07:41.250> make

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
the spine so this is what I would make

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.980 
the spine so this is what I would make
larger<00:07:42.030> the<00:07:42.180> next<00:07:42.480> times<00:07:44.360> and<00:07:45.360> then<00:07:45.600> it<00:07:45.780> just

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990 
larger the next times and then it just

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.600 
larger the next times and then it just
closes<00:07:46.320> like<00:07:46.800> this<00:07:48.140> and<00:07:49.140> the<00:07:49.440> belt<00:07:49.680> like<00:07:50.580> that

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610 
closes like this and the belt like that

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.470 
closes like this and the belt like that
and<00:07:51.240> that<00:07:51.480> is<00:07:51.750> my<00:07:52.080> bonus<00:07:52.920> project<00:07:53.340> from<00:07:54.180> I

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.480 
and that is my bonus project from I

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.750
