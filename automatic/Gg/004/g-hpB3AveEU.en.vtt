one<00:02:57.640> reverse<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:59.239> think<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.370> helix<00:03:01.370> force<00:03:01.820> or

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
one reverse I think it's helix force or

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.580 
one reverse I think it's helix force or
something<00:03:02.209> like<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.330> even<00:03:02.570> now<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:03.290> it's

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.690 
something like that even now but it's
that<00:03:03.830> sign<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.040> great<00:03:07.190> encounters<00:03:07.610> i

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700
