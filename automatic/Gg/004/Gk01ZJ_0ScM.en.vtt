00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.490
 so is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.490
 you are right 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 for some it's half laziness to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
 others a rocker from Madrid who sings 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 life and for the more than 800 people 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 that Saturday filled the electric room 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.210
 bristol leyva is almost a religion for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.210
 that all of us 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.790
 to the subjects of his last work gunpowder 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.580
 they were welcomed with open arms 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.560
 and chanted to aphonia by the fans 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.810
 Spanish residents in London who 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.060
 they gave everything in a magical night in the 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.520
 that rock without subtitles closed season 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.230
 who awakes end of season to 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.140
 rock without subtitles of programming 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.540
 deluxe leyva and mega spanish party the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.790
 last until September judging by the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.100
 queues to anticipate a big night and the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.229
 electric band room will be safe and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.300
 full of our fish to play here in the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.970
 cradle of the animals of the pistols of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.490
 the stands of the bears 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.350
 of the beatles kings 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.750
 he is very excited because they are all 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.930
 memories and references of songs and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.840
 clear for the English of their folklore 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.570
 for us our folklore is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 martyrdom and manolo escobar was not the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.479
 the first time that leiva visited the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 British capital 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.159
 the last time I played with pérez does what 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 that five years a four cost 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.289
 years in a week room scale 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.549
 also with rock without subtitles and it's the 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.560
 first time I come with leiva with 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.679
 bands here in london but this time the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.000
 show was much more electric and mature 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.560
 likewise defines the leive itself 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.869
 derives that he has taken his project 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 staff backed by them 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.700
 musicians who already turn it off lazily but 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.119
 much more professional and according to your 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.740
 Life moment music and songs 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.420
 they end up being a vital photograph of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 moment in which you live not therefore 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 laziness was over a few years ago and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.230
 in 64 over there and in these four years 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.290
 I've heard a lot of music have passed me 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.000
 many personal and musical things 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 language is still and the root is still 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 being the same what I can contribute 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.280
 new something behaved with laziness is that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.230
 metals have a leading role 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.940
 important in the project the show that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.489
 took to the stage was more than 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.070
 rolled it was already more than 120 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.079
 concerts with his latest work and 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.890
 they wanted to show the exiled public 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.780
 in London 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.050
 the show as they have walked 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.510
 for the scenarios 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.470
 and Latin Americans the truth that 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.880
 we carry 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.420
 a year and a half playing with gunpowder 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.069
 We have about 120 shows and a 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.560
 we have been doing the repertoire that 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.420
 we are varying very little 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.890
 that three or four songs but we come 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.270
 with the same insurance here in london that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.220
 there were a lot of people who did not see her 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.989
 still none that do not see communion 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.480
 between the audience and the band was total 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.670
 throughout the concert the euphoria at 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.010
 receive hits as terribly cruel or 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.110
 outside in the city intertwined theme 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.480
 after issue including pieces of his 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.180
 previous work as in the fearful my 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.069
 better version at times it seemed that 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.690
 the band will literally be 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.330
 between friends and one of the moments 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.670
 culminating came in the vis when it 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.340
 They dared with a classic applicator 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.290
 of the rodríguez but after almost two 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.600
 hour concert the night electric 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.819
 brixton had done nothing but push and 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.580
 with little time to recover other 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.260
 a thousand more people joined the party 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.870
 the last mega spanish from the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.269
 a memorable season was a success 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.340
 resounding attendance and confirmation 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.380
 that the rock project without subtitles and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.830
 remember to stop them I think an idea 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.720
 wow and the first as acid for the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.690
 artists that come already like that me 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.790
 it seems an incredible idea not to jump here 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.829
 and spend a weekend 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.360
 is touching I think it's nice that 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.140
 someone is studying currando and 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.150
 come a group that the illusion of his 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.590
 country and your land and that reminds you of 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.409
 your smells and your things 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.630
 giving affection and greetings to all 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:21.180
 working class dishwashers waiters 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.370
 engineers architects be of the rank that 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.220
 be 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.949
 We came here to take away a little 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.750
 morriña and give us a little bit of wine 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.419
 so I hope you enjoy and thank you 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.560
 by intern at the moment we 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.560
 we meet again in snake
