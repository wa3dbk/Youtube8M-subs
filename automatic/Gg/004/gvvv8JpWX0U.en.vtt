00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 beauty people here who speaks is what the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.379
 gh is so this is the first video of the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.340
 channel and have just created a channel is 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.389
 tornado 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.889
 it's in this channel here I wish I wanted 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.480
 leave this video for you to leave 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.279
 clear what am I going to bring this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 new channel for those who do not know until a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.910
 another channel is for tutorials in general that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 It's called tutorials, gh and but I wanted to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.699
 to win a new channel focused on programs 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.189
 image and video editors is here at 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 beginning of this channel I will be focusing 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 more in the image managers because the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.610
 computer is too slow is too bad 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.030
 You can not bring tutorials 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.780
 eee video editors plus one 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 system and 32 bits and this is from here to see 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.410
 the end of the year will be acquired 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.920
 new computer on the computer 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.690
 then be able to bring 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.129
 this tutorials and video 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 but for now let's stay in 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.410
 image tutorials for now 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.809
 image editors and I also wanted to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 tell you there I'll be already 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.030
 launching soon a basic course 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.060
 for photoshop cs 6 is not nothing much here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.900
 even because it is the basics is not then and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 First I'll be there pitching 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.240
 you this basic course of photoshop 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 using photoshop cs 6 later 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 it may be that the bid plus 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.509
 advanced intermediate who knows right? 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 so we'll see if the business to work 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.439
 this project works out is my main 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.049
 The objective is that this channel was 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.990
 I received two interest notices on the channel 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.630
 in the gh2 tutorial unfair birds I answered 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.000
 but I lost the cause and did not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.829
 I am therefore able to view any 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 type of video because it does not contain 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.509
 pictures and videos and I'm 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 receiving warnings of improper material 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.170
 so I'll have to wait six months 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.820
 to post videos on the other channel 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.100
 while I decided to create this channel 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.520
 here because my legacy business is 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.200
 produce content for the internet then 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.760
 I can not stand still I'm creating 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.800
 this tutorial is and I hope it's happening 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.650
 my knowledge of how best to 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.370
 you extract as much as possible and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 is to be thus spent there in the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.470
 video-tutorials then I count on the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.930
 support of all of you and I hope you are 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.050
 With me, it's good until the next time. 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.050
 Video lessons
