00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.020 
me feel really like sluggish or
something<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.550> sounds<00:00:41.820> really

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
something I know that sounds really

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090 
something I know that sounds really
weird<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.690> probably<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.469> shouldn't<00:00:43.980> do

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
weird and it probably it shouldn't do

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
weird and it probably it shouldn't do
that<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.079> reason<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that but I don't know for some reason I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
that but I don't know for some reason I
was<00:00:46.469> having<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> hard<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.340> almond<00:00:47.670> milk

was having a hard time with almond milk
so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.090> switched<00:00:48.390> back<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> soy<00:00:48.989> milk<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.309> I'm

so I switched back to soy milk and I'm
gonna<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.210> makes<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> difference<00:00:51.660> um

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
gonna see if that makes a difference um
