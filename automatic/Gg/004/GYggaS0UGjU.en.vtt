adds<00:01:58.180> up<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.540> be<00:01:58.660> just<00:01:58.899> magical<00:01:59.800> right

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
adds up to be just magical right

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.590 
adds up to be just magical right
how<00:02:00.310> can<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.610> be<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:00.880> much<00:02:01.060> better<00:02:01.240> cuz<00:02:01.509> I'm

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
how can it be that much better cuz I'm

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.030 
how can it be that much better cuz I'm
paper<00:02:01.840> yeah<00:02:02.140> there's<00:02:02.410> some<00:02:02.500> improvements<00:02:03.009> I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
paper yeah there's some improvements I

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.139 
paper yeah there's some improvements I
think<00:02:03.160> it's<00:02:03.280> an<00:02:03.340> extra<00:02:03.520> three<00:02:03.700> brake<00:02:03.910> horse

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
think it's an extra three brake horse

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.150 
think it's an extra three brake horse
power<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.630> unlock<00:02:04.750> kilograms<00:02:05.290> lighter<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
power to unlock kilograms lighter and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.469 
power to unlock kilograms lighter and
also<00:02:06.310> they've<00:02:06.430> changed<00:02:06.640> just<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> exhaust

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
also they've changed just the exhaust

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.389 
also they've changed just the exhaust
but<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:08.350> doesn't<00:02:08.590> seem<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.040> drastic

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
but it doesn't seem to be that drastic

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.010 
but it doesn't seem to be that drastic
and<00:02:09.489> yet<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:09.700> you're<00:02:09.820> saying<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.780> bike

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
and yet what you're saying is this bike

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.080 
and yet what you're saying is this bike
is<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.470> much<00:02:11.739> better<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.400> incredible<00:02:12.880> to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
is that much better it's incredible to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.690 
is that much better it's incredible to
move<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.500> work<00:02:14.709> done<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.340> reposition

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
move on the work done to reposition

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.380 
move on the work done to reposition
exhaust<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.600> massive<00:02:17.110> amount<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.410> work

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
exhaust is a massive amount of work

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.729 
exhaust is a massive amount of work
people<00:02:19.390> may<00:02:19.540> say<00:02:19.780> up<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.959> pocket<00:02:20.410> on<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.560> sides

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
people may say up to pocket on the sides

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.130 
people may say up to pocket on the sides
and<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.070> bottom<00:02:21.340> job<00:02:21.700> done<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.330> whole<00:02:22.510> weight

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and a bottom job done the whole weight

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.110 
and a bottom job done the whole weight
distribution<00:02:23.440> had<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.860> change<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:25.000> that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
distribution had to change and that

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.030 
distribution had to change and that
dramatically<00:02:25.870> affects<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> bite<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.709> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
dramatically affects the bite and and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.380 
dramatically affects the bite and and
improves<00:02:27.459> our<00:02:27.580> handling<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.090> when<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.330> were

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
improves our handling but when we were

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
improves our handling but when we were
cruising<00:02:28.660> around<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.930> Tron<00:02:29.290> test<00:02:29.530> rider<00:02:29.739> just

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
cruising around the Tron test rider just

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.090 
cruising around the Tron test rider just
to<00:02:30.370> normal<00:02:30.880> speed<00:02:31.060> very<00:02:31.810> slow<00:02:32.019> there<00:02:32.830> wasn't

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
to normal speed very slow there wasn't

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.949 
to normal speed very slow there wasn't
that<00:02:33.190> much<00:02:33.640> noticeable<00:02:34.150> change<00:02:34.390> yeah

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
that much noticeable change yeah

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.030 
that much noticeable change yeah
then<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.290> soon<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.590> open<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.860> throttle

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
then as soon as you open the throttle

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.820 
then as soon as you open the throttle
and<00:02:36.310> get<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.790> get<00:02:36.940> going<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:37.480> yeah<00:02:37.900> it's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
and get you can get going then yeah it's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.640 
and get you can get going then yeah it's
very<00:02:39.010> very<00:02:39.190> good

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.630 

see<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> lot<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.890> people<00:02:48.160> probably<00:02:48.310> think

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
see a lot of people probably think

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.860 
see a lot of people probably think
because<00:02:48.970> apart<00:02:49.210> from<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.390> exhaust<00:02:49.600> there's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
because apart from the exhaust there's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.000 
because apart from the exhaust there's
not<00:02:49.960> a<00:02:49.990> huge<00:02:50.290> amount<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.530> styling<00:02:50.860> changes

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
not a huge amount of styling changes

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.830 
not a huge amount of styling changes
this<00:02:51.430> isn't<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.790> brand<00:02:51.940> new<00:02:52.150> bike<00:02:52.300> but<00:02:52.600> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
this isn't a brand new bike but it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.240 
this isn't a brand new bike but it
really<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.350> think<00:02:53.500> there's<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.740> real<00:02:54.070> mud

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
really is I think there's a real mud

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.000 
really is I think there's a real mud
garden<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.910> foot<00:02:55.300> peg<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.840> only<00:02:56.170> components

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
garden of a foot peg the only components

engine yes they've made a few changes to

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.410 
engine yes they've made a few changes to
that<00:03:14.830> again<00:03:15.100> on<00:03:15.490> paper<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.060> doesn't<00:03:16.210> look<00:03:16.390> that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
that again on paper it doesn't look that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.570 
that again on paper it doesn't look that
massive<00:03:16.990> but<00:03:17.560> from<00:03:17.800> what<00:03:17.980> you've<00:03:18.160> been<00:03:18.310> saying

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
massive but from what you've been saying

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.220 
massive but from what you've been saying
to<00:03:18.640> me<00:03:18.700> kind<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:18.970> off-camera<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.870> makes<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.110> big

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
to me kind of off-camera it makes a big

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.780 
to me kind of off-camera it makes a big
difference<00:03:20.560> isn't<00:03:20.710> it<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.400> heart<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.640> any

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
difference isn't it the heart of any

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.550 
difference isn't it the heart of any
triumph<00:03:22.240> is<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.870> engine<00:03:23.170> yet<00:03:23.260> near<00:03:23.440> that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
triumph is is the engine yet near that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.890 
triumph is is the engine yet near that
River<00:03:23.830> engine<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.360> we've<00:03:25.360> always<00:03:25.510> said<00:03:25.630> it's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
River engine and we've always said it's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.240 
River engine and we've always said it's
almost<00:03:26.080> like<00:03:26.290> cheating<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.860> good<00:03:27.070> yeah

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
almost like cheating is that good yeah

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.130 
almost like cheating is that good yeah
this<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.180> perfect<00:03:28.390> makes<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> Super<00:03:29.050> Sport

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
this is a perfect makes the Super Sport

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.320 
this is a perfect makes the Super Sport
you<00:03:29.410> want<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.770> makes<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.070> have<00:03:30.330> torpedo

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
you want that makes you have torpedo

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.390 
you want that makes you have torpedo
which<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:32.020> deliver<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:32.980> thing<00:03:33.190> now

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
which can deliver and this thing now

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.670 
which can deliver and this thing now
from<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.330> bottom<00:03:34.630> really<00:03:35.050> really<00:03:35.230> hard<00:03:35.410> and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
from the bottom really really hard and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.620 
from the bottom really really hard and
just<00:03:35.740> spins<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.460> spins<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.820> spin<00:03:37.060> read

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
just spins and spins and spin read

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.460 
just spins and spins and spin read
harder<00:03:38.050> res<00:03:38.320> faster<00:03:38.830> it's<00:03:39.490> almost<00:03:39.760> like<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.470> 750

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
harder res faster it's almost like a 750

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.020 
harder res faster it's almost like a 750
you<00:03:41.590> know<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:42.670> that

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
you know on that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.880 
you know on that
okay<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:43.660> overall<00:03:44.260> was<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> package<00:03:44.740> because

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
okay so overall was a package because

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.890 
okay so overall was a package because
when<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.730> look<00:03:45.880> at<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.150> people<00:03:46.570> saying<00:03:46.780> what

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
is it is ten thousand five hundred

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.150 
is it is ten thousand five hundred
pounds<00:03:48.450> Iverson<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.900> is<00:03:50.050> expensive<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:50.800> don't

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
pounds Iverson it is expensive but don't

pounds Iverson it is expensive but don't
get<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.340> lot<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.550> electronic<00:03:51.940> aids<00:03:52.120> as<00:03:52.270> well<00:03:52.420> I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
get a lot of electronic aids as well I

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.210 
get a lot of electronic aids as well I
do<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.780> know<00:03:53.050> but<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.620> know<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.950> got<00:03:54.100> the

you yeah and you do a BAS slipper clutch
oh<00:04:01.300> yeah<00:04:01.510> actually<00:04:01.660> Gabe<00:04:01.930> yes<00:04:02.170> I've<00:04:02.440> heard

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709

quite really good things about this and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.670 
quite really good things about this and
I've<00:04:04.239> got<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.450> circuit<00:04:04.840> mode<00:04:04.959> on<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.230> as<00:04:05.500> well

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
I've got a circuit mode on this as well

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.229 
I've got a circuit mode on this as well
which<00:04:05.950> pretty<00:04:06.220> much<00:04:06.310> turns<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.790> off<00:04:06.910> doesn't

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
which pretty much turns it off doesn't

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.820 
which pretty much turns it off doesn't
it<00:04:07.270> allows<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.959> use<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.590> lot<00:04:08.680> more

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
it allows you to use it a lot more

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.410 
it allows you to use it a lot more
aggressively<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.340> track<00:04:09.580> yeah<00:04:09.970> absolutely<00:04:10.120> I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
aggressively on track yeah absolutely I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.460 
aggressively on track yeah absolutely I
mean<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.600> just<00:04:10.660> press<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> button<00:04:10.989> anything<00:04:11.380> to

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
mean you just press a button anything to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.560 
mean you just press a button anything to
say<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:11.769> mode<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.100> dash<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:13.269> this<00:04:13.450> is

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
say I can mode on a dash and this is

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.090 
say I can mode on a dash and this is
without<00:04:13.690> doubt<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.140> best<00:04:14.170> ABS<00:04:14.470> system

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
without doubt the best ABS system

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.640 
without doubt the best ABS system

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.180 
build quality and how much that's come
on<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.230> last<00:04:47.350> couple<00:04:47.440> years<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:47.890> I've<00:04:48.040> been

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
on in the last couple years so I've been

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.860 
on in the last couple years so I've been
pretty<00:04:48.400> massive<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.850> this<00:04:49.030> respect<00:04:49.510> I'm<00:04:49.690> there

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
pretty massive in this respect I'm there

destroying the other bikes the paddock

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.970 
destroying the other bikes the paddock
and<00:05:18.340> like<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.640> said<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.880> changes<00:05:19.270> will<00:05:19.450> be<00:05:19.540> felt

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
and like I said the changes will be felt

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.980 
and like I said the changes will be felt
more<00:05:20.980> by<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.340> faster<00:05:22.210> riders<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.690> faster

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
more by the faster riders and the faster

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.760 
more by the faster riders and the faster
you<00:05:23.020> go<00:05:23.230> the<00:05:23.500> better

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.990
