00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.949 
could take this see those two screws
here<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.120> then<00:03:18.120> add<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.660> side<00:03:18.930> so

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
here and then add it to this side so

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.570 
here and then add it to this side so
then<00:03:19.470> what<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:19.980> would<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.550> would

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
then what that would do is you would

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.060 
then what that would do is you would
make<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.030> close<00:03:21.300> draw<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.380> let's<00:03:22.620> say<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:22.770> some

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
make it close draw so let's say for some

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.550 
make it close draw so let's say for some
of<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.250> guys<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.580> need<00:03:23.700> cross<00:03:24.000> draw<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:25.380> can

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
of you guys that need cross draw you can

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.620 
of you guys that need cross draw you can
just<00:03:25.739> reach<00:03:25.890> really<00:03:26.070> right<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.540> know

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
just reach really right and you know

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.210 
just reach really right and you know
your<00:03:27.780> taser<00:03:27.989> opposite<00:03:28.620> side<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.830> your<00:03:28.950> gun

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
your taser opposite side of your gun

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.180 
your taser opposite side of your gun
hand<00:03:29.459> your<00:03:30.390> gun<00:03:30.540> side<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.050> then<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.770> do<00:03:31.950> cross

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
hand your gun side and then you do cross

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.500 
hand your gun side and then you do cross
strong<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.610> was<00:03:32.910> cool<00:03:33.060> cuz<00:03:33.270> you'd<00:03:33.360> hit

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
strong so that was cool cuz you'd hit

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.300 
strong so that was cool cuz you'd hit
two<00:03:33.600> by<00:03:33.690> two<00:03:33.750> holsters<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.130> have

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
two by two holsters and then you have

two by two holsters and then you have
your<00:03:35.489> cartridges<00:03:36.000> back<00:03:36.209> here<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.480> could

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
your cartridges back here you could

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.910 
your cartridges back here you could
still<00:03:36.840> reach<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.230> need<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.470> put<00:03:37.830> in

rubber<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.230> thing's<00:03:58.440> still<00:03:58.650> going<00:04:00.470> now

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
rubber and this thing's still going now

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.110 
rubber and this thing's still going now
here's<00:04:01.709> how<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.890> cartridges<00:04:02.610> go<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.060> out

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
here's how the cartridges go in and out

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.940 
here's how the cartridges go in and out
you<00:04:03.780> just<00:04:03.930> squeeze<00:04:04.200> right<00:04:04.410> here<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.800> that's

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
you just squeeze right here and that's

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.229 
you just squeeze right here and that's
what<00:04:08.070> looks<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.370> without<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.760> cartridge<00:04:09.090> in

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
what looks like without the cartridge in

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.540 
what looks like without the cartridge in
there<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.560> cartridge<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.010> was<00:04:11.160> facing

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
there and the cartridge this was facing

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.009 
there and the cartridge this was facing
down<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.120> one's<00:04:12.360> facing<00:04:12.989> up<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.840> try

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
down and this one's facing up so you try

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.270 
down and this one's facing up so you try
to<00:04:16.080> put<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.350> into<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.590> way<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.010> ain't<00:04:17.100> gonna

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to put it into this way it ain't gonna

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.219 
to put it into this way it ain't gonna
work<00:04:17.370> that's<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.570> way<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.750> was<00:04:18.810> made<00:04:18.960> to<00:04:19.109> go

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
work that's the way it was made to go

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.539 
work that's the way it was made to go
one<00:04:19.500> up<00:04:19.620> one<00:04:19.799> down

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
one up one down

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.540 
one up one down
and<00:04:22.060> they<00:04:22.810> click<00:04:23.259> in<00:04:23.410> like<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.460> that's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
and they click in like that and that's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.830 
and they click in like that and that's
what<00:04:24.759> that<00:04:24.789> looks<00:04:24.910> like<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.240> they're<00:04:25.660> very

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
what that looks like so they're very

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.180 
what that looks like so they're very
easy<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.139> come<00:04:26.259> out<00:04:26.349> and<00:04:26.530> they<00:04:26.590> actually<00:04:26.830> stay

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
easy to come out and they actually stay

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.290 
easy to come out and they actually stay
I've<00:04:27.280> never<00:04:27.490> had<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.699> problem<00:04:27.970> with<00:04:28.090> them

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
I've never had a problem with them

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.480 
I've never had a problem with them
bouncing<00:04:28.840> out<00:04:28.960> or<00:04:29.110> falling<00:04:29.349> out<00:04:29.470> I'd<00:04:30.190> get<00:04:30.370> rid

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
bouncing out or falling out I'd get rid

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.270 
bouncing out or falling out I'd get rid
of<00:04:30.639> if<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.819> did<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.569> right<00:04:31.720> here<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.080> basically

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
of if I did this right here is basically

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.730 
of if I did this right here is basically
those<00:04:33.280> forward<00:04:33.699> as<00:04:33.849> you<00:04:34.090> can<00:04:34.240> tell<00:04:34.419> and<00:04:34.740> that's

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
those forward as you can tell and that's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.409 
those forward as you can tell and that's
how<00:04:35.889> it's<00:04:36.340> basically<00:04:36.610> kept<00:04:36.879> in<00:04:37.000> by<00:04:37.120> pressure

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
how it's basically kept in by pressure

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.029 
how it's basically kept in by pressure
so<00:04:37.840> now<00:04:37.930> I'm<00:04:37.990> gonna<00:04:38.139> put<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.379> Taser<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.800> and

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
so now I'm gonna put the Taser in and

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.990 
so now I'm gonna put the Taser in and
this<00:04:39.849> is<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.389> can<00:04:40.449> see<00:04:40.539> on<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:40.990> side<00:04:42.000> this

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
this is so you can see on this side this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.100 
this is so you can see on this side this
strap<00:04:43.270> would<00:04:43.449> get<00:04:43.569> in<00:04:43.659> the<00:04:43.720> way<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> lot<00:04:44.050> of

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
strap would get in the way a lot of

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.589 
strap would get in the way a lot of
times<00:04:44.229> for<00:04:44.710> four<00:04:45.069> people<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.360> would<00:04:46.569> just

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
times for four people so we would just

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.559 
times for four people so we would just
turn<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.819> so<00:04:48.819> basically<00:04:49.030> all

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
turn it like this so basically all

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.100 
turn it like this so basically all
you're<00:04:49.810> doing<00:04:50.050> is<00:04:50.289> putting<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.690> bottom<00:04:52.960> and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
you're doing is putting the bottom and

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.770 
you're doing is putting the bottom and
first<00:04:53.319> move<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.220> strap<00:04:54.520> out<00:04:54.699> of<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.789> way<00:04:54.909> push

can't be done anything is possible
just<00:05:19.090> like<00:05:19.210> gun<00:05:19.360> takeaways<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:20.020> know<00:05:20.259> how<00:05:20.409> to<00:05:20.469> do

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
just like gun takeaways I know how to do

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.740 
just like gun takeaways I know how to do
that<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:20.949> many<00:05:21.759> also<00:05:22.180> know<00:05:22.479> the<00:05:22.569> same

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
that and many also know the same

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.510 
that and many also know the same
techniques<00:05:23.169> on<00:05:23.289> different<00:05:23.590> holsters<00:05:23.919> so

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
techniques on different holsters so

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.920 
techniques on different holsters so
basically<00:05:24.789> if<00:05:25.090> this<00:05:25.240> was<00:05:25.389> on<00:05:25.479> your<00:05:25.630> system

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
basically if this was on your system

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.620 
basically if this was on your system
right<00:05:26.050> here<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:27.729> by<00:05:27.849> the<00:05:27.909> way<00:05:28.030> if<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.479> want

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
right here and by the way if you want

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.839 
right here and by the way if you want
you<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:28.930> find<00:05:29.050> attaches<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.680> Molly<00:05:29.919> with<00:05:30.819> a

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
you can find attaches to Molly with a

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.730 
you can find attaches to Molly with a
belt<00:05:31.120> system<00:05:31.449> or<00:05:31.569> something<00:05:31.750> velcro<00:05:32.469> strap

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
belt system or something velcro strap

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.180 
belt system or something velcro strap
through<00:05:32.889> there<00:05:33.479> in<00:05:34.479> different<00:05:34.930> ways<00:05:35.190> so

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
through there in different ways so

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.519 
through there in different ways so
basically<00:05:36.580> this<00:05:36.789> would<00:05:36.940> be<00:05:37.060> unsnapped<00:05:37.529> your

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
basically this would be unsnapped your

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.439 
basically this would be unsnapped your
gun<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:38.830> still<00:05:39.039> safe<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:39.580> this<00:05:39.789> is<00:05:39.969> not<00:05:40.120> moving

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
gun is still safe and this is not moving

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.779 
gun is still safe and this is not moving
it's<00:05:40.779> not<00:05:40.960> coming<00:05:41.319> out<00:05:41.469> you<00:05:42.370> have<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.699> move

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
it's not coming out you have to move

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:43.890 
it's not coming out you have to move
this<00:05:43.000> forward<00:05:43.210> so<00:05:43.419> I'm<00:05:43.479> gonna<00:05:43.569> do<00:05:43.690> with<00:05:43.810> two

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
this forward so I'm gonna do with two

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.189 
this forward so I'm gonna do with two
hands<00:05:44.110> as<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:44.349> can<00:05:44.500> see<00:05:45.599> as<00:05:46.599> you're<00:05:46.900> pushing

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
hands as you can see as you're pushing

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.620 
hands as you can see as you're pushing
that<00:05:47.289> forward<00:05:47.349> that<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.009> unlocks<00:05:48.550> that<00:05:48.819> and

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
that forward that and unlocks that and

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.870 
that forward that and unlocks that and
then<00:05:49.870> you're<00:05:50.080> x26<00:05:50.889> teaser<00:05:51.159> comes<00:05:51.400> out<00:05:51.550> so<00:05:51.759> then

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
then you're x26 teaser comes out so then

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.939 
then you're x26 teaser comes out so then
we<00:05:52.029> put<00:05:52.240> this<00:05:52.360> back<00:05:52.569> in<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:53.469> want<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.740> start

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
we put this back in you want to start

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.040 
we put this back in you want to start
down<00:05:54.099> here<00:05:54.130> first

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
down here first

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.360 
down here first
this<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.199> rest<00:05:56.409> in<00:05:56.560> move<00:05:56.800> this<00:05:56.949> rubber<00:05:57.159> part

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
this is rest in move this rubber part

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.620 
this is rest in move this rubber part
cuz<00:05:57.610> it<00:05:57.699> gets<00:05:57.759> in<00:05:57.940> the<00:05:58.000> way<00:05:59.159> it<00:06:00.159> snaps<00:06:00.430> in<00:06:00.639> so<00:06:01.419> if

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
cuz it gets in the way it snaps in so if

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.790 
cuz it gets in the way it snaps in so if
you<00:06:01.779> were<00:06:01.900> doing<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.199> with<00:06:02.259> your<00:06:02.409> left<00:06:02.560> hand

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
you were doing it with your left hand

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.790 
you were doing it with your left hand
you<00:06:03.699> would<00:06:03.819> actually<00:06:04.080> grab<00:06:05.080> your<00:06:05.289> teaser<00:06:05.529> well

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
and obviously this is going to be very

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.450 
and obviously this is going to be very
sturdy<00:06:07.389> on<00:06:07.539> your<00:06:07.659> belt<00:06:07.840> has<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.289> be<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:08.889> then

little quick push and it's so loose and

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
little quick push and it's so loose and
then<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.520> could<00:06:15.669> actually<00:06:15.789> pull<00:06:16.029> it<00:06:16.120> up

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
then you could actually pull it up

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.309 
then you could actually pull it up
really<00:06:16.419> quick<00:06:16.719> so<00:06:17.610> that's<00:06:18.610> how<00:06:18.699> you<00:06:18.759> put<00:06:18.969> it<00:06:19.000> in

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.240 
you could use a some other video you
could<00:06:46.390> put<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.720> Taser<00:06:47.020> in<00:06:47.230> this<00:06:47.410> and<00:06:48.070> actually

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
could put the Taser in this and actually

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.310 
could put the Taser in this and actually
shove<00:06:48.550> this<00:06:48.700> inside<00:06:49.300> one<00:06:49.570> over<00:06:49.720> your<00:06:49.810> AR<00:06:50.110> mag
