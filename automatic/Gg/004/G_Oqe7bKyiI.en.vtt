00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello all guys this video will try 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 about confirmed animals that there will be 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 in gta 5 before starting the video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.809
 I want to clarify two things first during 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.240
 the next two weeks I will upload few 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.400
 videos only on weekends already 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.830
 better a day that does not have an exam because 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 I have the fucking week of exams and I 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.260
 they are dilating the year xc exams but 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 the summer is very close they are only 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 three weeks force guys that already 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.850
 we are almost xe in summer yes I will upload 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.020
 many videos since I have all the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.329
 world time 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 - In September I will have to recover 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.790
 the suspended subjects xd of the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.980
 second thing I want to clarify is that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.039
 some say he copied me from gta world 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 5 this happened when I uploaded the video of 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 info from poland I put it in a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.570
 comment and they sent me two messages 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.239
 private saying it was a copycat me 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 I did not copy dm I just put the same 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.160
 what was in the translation of the iphone 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 world gta 5 also put the same thing is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.600
 say put the translation exactly as 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.000
 I was 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.549
 and since when is that called copying 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.130
 it's the same as when they send you to copy 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.690
 the statement of an exercise and all the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.200
 others write what they put in the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.899
 enunciated just like you good now yes 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 let's start with the animals that all 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.399
 which are below are confirmed 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.560
 100% good let's start 1 seagull the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.049
 Seagull is a bird that we could see in 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.090
 the first trailer of gta 5 where there was 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.119
 a boy and a girl with their dog in a 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.850
 beach and up there were some seagulls if not 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.470
 I was wrong in gta 4 there were seagulls but 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.229
 you could not kill x of 2 body the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.030
 crow is a black bird this this what 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.729
 we could see in the trevor trailer 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.009
 although the crow was well hidden 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.509
 he was also in green to redemption and he 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.030
 I could kill three deer second me 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.850
 report they gave a deer drinking water 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.280
 of the facundo river in the forest area that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.739
 There will be a car zone in Gta 5 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.480
 of cash probably have challenges 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.730
 hunt some animal 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.709
 although hunting in real life does not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.989
 It does not fucking grace but if it's in a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.849
 game does not bother me four rabbits 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.709
 game informer said that when they went 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.530
 walking through the forest they found 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.569
 several of these little mammals these 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.690
 animals were in return redemption 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.700
 the fauna of gta 5 will be very similar to the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.220
 of network redemption but I believe that 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.049
 will have more wildlife since the map is much 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.329
 Largest 5 reasons according to the magazine 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.370
 Polish said they could see mice 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.099
 scampering through the poorest streets of 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.680
 the saints this offers great realism 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.170
 to the game in the assassin's believe 3 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.599
 there were also reasons for the street that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.569
 if the mice stepped on them they died and the 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.569
 burst xd 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.120
 hens a magazine said they could 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.310
 see chickens on farms do not 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.379
 It is very surprising that they are there because when 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.680
 they said there were farms I thought what 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:16.340
 it is more certain that there were hens 7 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.950
 wildcat game informer confirmed that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.209
 we will have this animal in gta 5 since what 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.609
 they could see with their own eyes 8 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.129
 coyote the ign magazine said that when 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.499
 they were walking they found a coyote 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.239
 this animal was also green 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:37.219
 redemption 9 fly the flies looked 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.019
 in the trailers of gta 5 that 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.049
 specifically in the first trailer 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.000
 were flitting through the garbage you 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.000
 you imagine that they are in the shits of 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.489
 dogs would be very real and when we step 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.560
 the zurullos that pursue us flies xd 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:57.439
 of 10 the bear the myth of the bear of gta 5 it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.199
 has made real the public cvg magazine 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.840
 that there were bears in gta 5 this animal 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.510
 it will apparently be very difficult to kill was 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.500
 of my favorite king to redemption 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.269
 11 squirrel some journalists tried the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.040
 demo and claimed to see squirrels 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.510
 scampering through the trees that had 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.310
 near the river 12 wolf the magazine 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.460
 Spanish consoles today claimed that 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.199
 there were wolves in gta 5 the wolf is one of 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.090
 my favorite animals x of 13 fish are 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.139
 he could see in an image where he went to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.560
 trevor diving some fish behind him 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.600
 14 salmon the subway magazine clarified 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.330
 that there were people fishing salmon in the 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.660
 river but unfortunately we do not 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.389
 we can fish and remember these words 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.270
 guys where there are salmon there are bears or 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.130
 less happens in real life xd but I 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.080
 would be well armed in that area in case 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:59.060
 perhaps x of 15 a mountain lion east 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.460
 predator was seen informer organ 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.680
 where they said he was chasing 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.930
 a deer which shows that they have 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.850
 improved this finger of redemption and 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.820
 that animals did not persecute others 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.170
 to hunt but in gta 5 yes 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:18.140
 16 but obviously this animal is in 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.830
 gta 5 at the moment we only saw the race of 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.980
 rottweiler 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.480
 I hope rockstar includes many more 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.240
 would be fucking mother train the 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.460
 dogs tell them to attack fights 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.500
 of dogs to earn money buy them 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.450
 necklaces that the safest thing is that it 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.460
 can buy 17 shark necklaces 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.290
 sharks we could see them in an image 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.150
 removed from a long time ago 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.580
 give me informer said to try 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.440
 be away from sharks and what if 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.470
 we find ourselves with a face shark 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.720
 we had to give up for dead 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.050
 I wish to touch include harpoons or something to 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.190
 to be able to kill them but I doubt it enough 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.410
 they also said that we could 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.950
 find a shark devouring a 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.070
 person doing a bloodbath 18 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.710
 low this animal could be seen in a 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.860
 image of gta 5 where there was a farm and 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.009
 a tractor and behind were cows 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.389
 they were also in returning redemption 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.520
 19 goat magazine said they gave a 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.550
 mountain goat while they descended with 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.279
 parachute with fragile good for now 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.529
 there are only 19 animals confirmed 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.199
 sure there will be many more but still 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.569
 nothing was said of them well here 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.449
 ends the animal video I hope that 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.990
 I liked you goodbye goodbye and until 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.990
 the next
