where mine does if not just keep trying
to<00:00:57.300> chuck<00:00:57.510> care<00:00:57.719> packages<00:00:58.140> down<00:00:58.289> you'll

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to chuck care packages down you'll

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
to chuck care packages down you'll
eventually<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> get

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
another care package and do pretty much

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
another care package and do pretty much
exactly<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.609> same<00:01:02.820> thing<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.690> hope<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
exactly the same thing and hope that the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.670 
exactly the same thing and hope that the
second<00:01:04.619> care<00:01:04.799> package<00:01:05.159> lands<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
second care package lands on top of the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.870 
second care package lands on top of the
first<00:01:07.680> care<00:01:07.950> package<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> check<00:01:08.850> down

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
first care package that you check down

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
first care package that you check down
and<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> correctly<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.590> act

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and if you do it correctly it will act

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
and if you do it correctly it will act
like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.100> staircase<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> just

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
like a little staircase then you just

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
like a little staircase then you just
jump<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.049> jump<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> jump<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.130> you'll

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
