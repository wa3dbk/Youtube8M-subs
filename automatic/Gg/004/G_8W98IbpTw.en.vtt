fretboard it breaking up the yeah that's

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.900 
fretboard it breaking up the yeah that's
how<00:04:18.800> it<00:04:18.860> sounds<00:04:19.190> with<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.550> if<00:04:19.640> we<00:04:19.730> go<00:04:19.850> to

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
how it sounds with that and if we go to

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:58.510 
how it sounds with that and if we go to
the<00:04:20.090> middle<00:04:20.210> pickup<00:04:20.540> do<00:04:20.750> left<00:04:20.900> or<00:04:21.140> funky<00:04:21.500> stuff

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520

Mexi<00:06:07.830> straps<00:06:08.159> are<00:06:08.250> going<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.460> say<00:06:08.610> they're<00:06:08.880> not

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
Mexi straps are going to say they're not

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.730 
Mexi straps are going to say they're not
worth<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.419> price<00:06:09.599> difference<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.500> yeah

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
worth the price difference and yeah

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.909 
worth the price difference and yeah
probably<00:06:11.159> isn't<00:06:11.759> really<00:06:12.710> initial<00:06:13.710> really

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
probably isn't really initial really

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.200 
probably isn't really initial really
keen<00:06:14.099> player<00:06:14.400> but<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:14.639> have<00:06:14.789> to<00:06:14.880> say<00:06:15.029> now<00:06:15.180> I

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
keen player but I have to say now I

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.790 
keen player but I have to say now I
played<00:06:15.889> these<00:06:16.889> strap<00:06:17.310> it<00:06:17.880> is<00:06:18.090> you<00:06:18.389> know<00:06:18.800> it's

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
played these strap it is you know it's

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.180 
played these strap it is you know it's
definitely<00:06:19.919> nicer<00:06:21.440> but<00:06:22.440> on<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.650> whole<00:06:22.800> makes

these straps of superb absolutely superb
I<00:06:25.800> just<00:06:26.009> think<00:06:26.219> that<00:06:26.490> if<00:06:27.210> you<00:06:27.449> swapped<00:06:27.690> the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
I just think that if you swapped the

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.330 
I just think that if you swapped the
pickups<00:06:28.229> you<00:06:28.380> know<00:06:28.500> maybe<00:06:28.650> got<00:06:28.830> some<00:06:28.860> American

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
pickups you know maybe got some American

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.399 
pickups you know maybe got some American
pickups<00:06:29.759> put<00:06:30.120> them<00:06:30.240> in<00:06:30.389> Austin<00:06:30.870> Texas<00:06:31.020> special

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
pickups put them in Austin Texas special

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.379 
pickups put them in Austin Texas special
we<00:06:31.680> can<00:06:31.800> put<00:06:31.919> in<00:06:32.039> a<00:06:32.099> mixie<00:06:32.400> strap<00:06:32.699> to<00:06:32.940> try<00:06:33.150> that

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
we can put in a mixie strap to try that

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.839 
we can put in a mixie strap to try that
in<00:06:33.990> one<00:06:34.289> day<00:06:34.319> I<00:06:34.560> reckon<00:06:35.039> it<00:06:35.130> would<00:06:35.219> sound<00:06:35.400> on
