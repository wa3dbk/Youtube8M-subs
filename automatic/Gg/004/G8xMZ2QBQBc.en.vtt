 o'connor and well here we have a me 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.890
 eta and the draw consists of winning me what 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.800
 with an active nature that increases the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.649
 low speed the defense has attacks 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.230
 canon dance chaos that is a good attack 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.320
 since it has 100% accuracy and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.899
 confuses psychic to point and the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.690
 bliss skill that increases the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.539
 probability that with your attack there 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.399
 side effects and good you are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.050
 a natural and illegal in the game is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.230
 element that comes from his bolt glory and 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.320

 Well, that's how you pointed and the day of the draw 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.790
 I do not know if it will be live because there already 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.100
 he pointed it out and 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.860
 I just need you to put me in 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.440
 then in the third place there is only one 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 only prize there is only one me eta it for 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.910
 that will only be a winner 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.110
 any questions you can send a 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.140
 message by youtube 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.120
 you can volunteer meme skype which is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.190
 Well , can you ask me? 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.780
 I write better but it is live with 12 points 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.710
 I expose water or just look for us 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.350
 you were antro and this is the last thing you see 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.290
 5 o'clock maybe he will not clarify 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.240
 what it is is for you to have more 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.060
 odds of winning if you really 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.670
 You want the menu, well, you can 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.580
 increase by 2 the probability that 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.700
 you have to win as is that 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.390
 very simple you have to pass this video 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.850
 to another friend of yours for example and this one 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.690
 will have to put that has been referred 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.970
 by the previous 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.800
 I am the user x I have seen the channel 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.990
 I express I write that I will not participate in the 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 tournament and then to have more 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.220
 probabilities 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.380
 I want to do it with wonder then 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.300
 I have to count for a friend or with 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.920
 anyone who subscribes to 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.840
 channel and he sent me a message saying 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.750
 which is referred by the user x I do not know 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.800
 if it will have been clear but simply 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.900
 is to share the video that another person 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.040
 subscribe and so I took this probability 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.310
 that what simple but if not good 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.880
 if it is not easy you can ask me 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.250
 how do i tell you on skype on youtube or 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.200
 good both if it is not clear I do not think 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.790
 that a lot of people do but it's still 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.590
 a great opportunity to increase 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.510
 our probability in front 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.879
 and well that 's all this is the second 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.379
 draw that I do after which you've 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.260
 varied color that was already delivered to 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.730
 zero winner of bows and good luck to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.379
 all wishes and well that we see 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.379
 soon bye
