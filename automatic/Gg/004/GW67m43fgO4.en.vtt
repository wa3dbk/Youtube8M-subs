like an internet joke or something I

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.040 
like an internet joke or something I
guess<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:00.730> could<00:01:00.880> say<00:01:01.120> but<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.750> thing<00:01:01.899> is

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
guess you could say but the thing is

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.189 
guess you could say but the thing is
these<00:01:02.230> little<00:01:02.950> symbols<00:01:03.370> are<00:01:04.030> called<00:01:04.199> thorns

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
these little symbols are called thorns

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.740 
these little symbols are called thorns
and<00:01:05.470> they<00:01:06.040> originate<00:01:06.729> from<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.119> runic

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
and they originate from the runic

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.280 
and they originate from the runic
alphabet<00:01:08.439> where<00:01:08.920> one<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.430> them<00:01:09.579> by<00:01:10.030> themselves

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
alphabet where one of them by themselves

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.859 
alphabet where one of them by themselves
actually<00:01:11.290> means<00:01:11.560> giant<00:01:12.549> and<00:01:12.820> since<00:01:13.540> there<00:01:13.719> are

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
actually means giant and since there are

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.649 
actually means giant and since there are
11<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:14.530> these<00:01:14.680> in<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.159> album<00:01:15.549> title<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.240> there

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
11 of these in the album title and there

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.499 
11 of these in the album title and there
are<00:01:16.780> 11<00:01:17.259> tracks<00:01:17.649> on<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.340> album<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.999> each<00:01:19.149> one

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
are 11 tracks on this album and each one

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.599 
are 11 tracks on this album and each one
of<00:01:19.630> them<00:01:19.749> starts<00:01:20.259> with<00:01:20.469> one<00:01:20.679> of<00:01:20.799> these<00:01:20.859> thorns

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
of them starts with one of these thorns

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.539 
of them starts with one of these thorns
I<00:01:22.049> guess<00:01:23.049> you<00:01:23.200> could<00:01:23.380> loosely<00:01:23.649> translate<00:01:24.399> it

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
I guess you could loosely translate it

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.569 
I guess you could loosely translate it
into<00:01:24.759> eleven<00:01:25.479> giants<00:01:26.139> which<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:27.039> a<00:01:27.280> pretty

there<00:01:51.759> are<00:01:51.849> some<00:01:52.090> moments<00:01:52.209> where<00:01:52.569> this<00:01:52.659> is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
there are some moments where this is

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.529 
there are some moments where this is
evidently<00:01:53.439> a<00:01:53.560> one-man<00:01:54.249> project<00:01:54.999> the<00:01:55.179> drums

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the vocals themselves are quite possibly

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.370 
the vocals themselves are quite possibly
one

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
one

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.250 
one
the<00:02:28.470> best<00:02:28.710> parts<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.370> album<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.260> vocal

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the best parts of the album the vocal

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.790 
the best parts of the album the vocal
delivery<00:02:31.380> isn't<00:02:32.010> amazing<00:02:32.580> but<00:02:33.140> they're<00:02:34.140> mixed

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
delivery isn't amazing but they're mixed

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400 
delivery isn't amazing but they're mixed
extremely<00:02:35.670> well<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.210> feel<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.510> putting<00:02:37.020> black

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
extremely well I feel like putting black

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.160 
extremely well I feel like putting black
metal<00:02:37.650> vocals<00:02:38.160> up<00:02:38.340> too<00:02:38.670> high<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> mix<00:02:39.600> can

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
metal vocals up too high in the mix can

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.920 
metal vocals up too high in the mix can
kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.620> ruin<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> music<00:02:41.670> entirely<00:02:42.180> but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
kind of ruin the music entirely but

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.220 
kind of ruin the music entirely but
these<00:02:43.260> vocals<00:02:43.830> are<00:02:44.040> placed<00:02:44.940> perfectly<00:02:45.600> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
these vocals are placed perfectly just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.830 
these vocals are placed perfectly just
low<00:02:46.830> enough<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.150> guitar<00:02:48.630> distortion

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
low enough so that the guitar distortion

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.990 
low enough so that the guitar distortion
and<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.380> bass<00:02:49.620> are<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.010> blaring<00:02:50.520> over<00:02:50.850> them

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
and the bass are just blaring over them

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.840 
and the bass are just blaring over them
they're<00:02:51.180> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.860> obscured<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.430> still

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
they're kind of obscured but still

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.150 
they're kind of obscured but still
they're<00:02:54.360> high<00:02:54.630> enough<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.170> pay<00:02:55.650> attention<00:02:55.950> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
they're high enough to pay attention to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.340 
they're high enough to pay attention to
them<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.520> want<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.510> abrasiveness<00:02:58.230> of

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.830 
different variations there's even one
moment<00:04:08.459> during<00:04:08.580> one<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> solos<00:04:09.570> where<00:04:09.810> I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
moment during one of the solos where I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.110 
moment during one of the solos where I
recall<00:04:10.260> some<00:04:10.590> shredding<00:04:11.310> happening<00:04:11.820> just<00:04:11.970> a

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
recall some shredding happening just a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.310 
recall some shredding happening just a
little<00:04:12.360> bit<00:04:12.510> just<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.870> little<00:04:13.110> bit<00:04:13.230> of

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
little bit just a little bit of

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.590 
little bit just a little bit of
shredding<00:04:13.740> just<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:14.010> tiny<00:04:14.310> little<00:04:15.030> bit<00:04:15.360> and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
shredding just a tiny little bit and

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.420 
shredding just a tiny little bit and
that<00:04:15.959> kind<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.260> shocked<00:04:16.620> me<00:04:16.799> because<00:04:17.130> I'd

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
that kind of shocked me because I'd

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.070 
that kind of shocked me because I'd
never<00:04:17.580> really<00:04:17.910> heard<00:04:18.120> any<00:04:18.299> shredding<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
never really heard any shredding in a

discernible from one another there are

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.570 
discernible from one another there are
going<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:12.960> be<00:05:13.020> some<00:05:13.290> moments<00:05:13.620> where<00:05:13.830> yeah<00:05:14.280> it's

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
going to be some moments where yeah it's

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.909 
going to be some moments where yeah it's
loud<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:15.120> harsh<00:05:15.479> it's<00:05:15.780> distorted<00:05:16.530> that's

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.050 
loud it's harsh it's distorted that's
pretty<00:05:17.160> much<00:05:17.310> what<00:05:17.520> it's<00:05:17.639> being<00:05:17.820> from

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
pretty much what it's being from

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.180 
pretty much what it's being from
beginning<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.510> end<00:05:18.539> I<00:05:18.990> think<00:05:19.139> some<00:05:19.500> slower<00:05:19.889> or

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
beginning to end I think some slower or

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.279 
beginning to end I think some slower or
more<00:05:20.340> dark<00:05:20.669> ambient<00:05:21.180> or<00:05:21.449> more<00:05:21.690> building

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
broken it up and brought a ton a

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.029 
broken it up and brought a ton a
fantastic<00:05:27.210> variation<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:28.169> that<00:05:28.440> being<00:05:28.620> said
