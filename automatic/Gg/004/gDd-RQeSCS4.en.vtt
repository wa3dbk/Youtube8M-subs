00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.240
 yes I am back 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.620
 so come back 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.780
 two nets behind us and 4 seek and 6 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.929
 the third named- pulled series 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.939
 who thinks of old pictures already good to see 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.939
 he kneads certified Clement come to speak more 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.169
 very darkly recognized by the contrast 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.259
 that in this comparison from here also Auer I look 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.539
 that's what the game's going on 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.890
 because all of this ignorance private game minority one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.100
 because I just take a nem off the map 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.850
 four times a year otherwise always on Do 9 cards just once in mind 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.780
 run 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.700
 To make loads of impressions 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.520
 And that's exactly what we do Soost, Pyeongchang 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.190
 that's no matter we said before 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.160
 I could also research her for a soap with MEUR 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 to do that and that 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.560
 I see that's all 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.850
 Technically not to contrast so Doll 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 Pauli but probably already that he immediately with the strange goal 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.450
 also has to do that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850
 grandiose 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 probably also around 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.290
 could often do okay 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.180
 around 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.500
 Sondershausen and countries is questioned 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 Komorowski Land is okay 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 passing through the homes through through Doris Day in May 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 yes it is all open because very winding here 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.290
 Let's see more » 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.260
 he appealed 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
 So those who want to recognize their opponent there are then 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.830
 Plattner also misty 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.410
 you have to see 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.140
 but I think I did not recognize anything 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.770
 That is 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.690
 everything is over 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.180
 a small roundish one comes from the local 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 but here at Underworld is unlikely behind the house 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.500
 while watching 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.810
 descendants also ran 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.019
 There is no further notice here 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.269
 Year so a circle here 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.510
 everything is here but greets bigger friends 4 he yes I do not know anything 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.899
 to keep it 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.899
 Customers the polls 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.179
 yes OK no 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.629
 but now also something in the middle 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.900
 Revett determines every Viennese Schlager or so be and women place 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.569
 it is always 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.859
 sonoro Peter Tosh stood up for it 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.859
 and now all in vitro I am now a bit confused bald 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:39.949
 around 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.319
 yes, these used in the trade 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.959
 In the middle of the middle there is often not at all 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.109
 So not really for 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.909
 well I 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.629
 when I suddenly got so dr 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.899
 ultimately like that 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.319
 excited about it 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.639
 Sony still 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.639
 Oh yes, I do too 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.889
 well friends who gives 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.199
 make your own picture of course the ps3 and pc people can 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.149
 especially 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.579
 who play the x4 because the light probably buy it yourself 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.799
 and percent can then make their own picture of it 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.849
 So my opinion 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.289
 until now not so Dolle the others when you better 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:27.359
 so the Wars had been there not with one around her person here yet 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.049
 everything Russian 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.639
 Jac instead of dark it's weird gates and assists leads 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.289
 such men 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.289
 what is now to have a software function is what they do not 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.229
 then you will see 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.229
 whether he is almost to make each of the objects and that 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.319
 so must be served and Ronny Büttner at the starting point of a me 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.599
 say goodbye 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.599
 the attendant Mikota after Tepco grow to the old town 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.650
 make the Gate SU and then if monsters you so that Denner can
