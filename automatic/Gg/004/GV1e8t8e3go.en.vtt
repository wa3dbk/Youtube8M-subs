00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.820
 I welcome all fans of the game clash of 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.040
 clans with you again normal and today 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.600
 I would like to dedicate the issue to the clan 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.840
 which is already quite long 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.630
 time the clan is called apartments therefore 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 first I will tell you a little about him and 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.680
 the end will show a couple of battles of their clans 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.110
 clanwars which is passing right now 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.410
 fights are very interesting i picked them up 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.690
 especially for this video is on them 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.399
 look let's say so 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.820
 but for now you can say the clan 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.800
 3-4 months as far as I know 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.790
 average and during this time we spent already 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.440
 about 40 clan war of them 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:14.980
 one of them is defeated and now I 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.430
 I will open the list of the clan and I will say more precisely of them 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.200
 one loss and thirty six wins and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.400
 Pluses I hope one more victory we will get 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.330
 today it will be already 30 we remove 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.240
 victory all fights are pretty decent what 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.920
 can be said about the cups on land and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 nobody drives the cup we do not recruit 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 especially in this sense there is no in 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.880
 anyway at the development stage with us 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.360
 Farm as in the golden league and in 1 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 silver even 2 probably everything depends 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.210
 from the level of the player's ability 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.300
 guys are all at stake Vary doing well 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.290
 show this the main thing i am accounts 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.690
 the only defeat that we have 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.830
 it was in my memory 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.910
 here she was 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:08.950
 can see it now on the screen but what I want 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.530
 say the fault is absolutely not our war 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.540
 was much stronger than us and therefore 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.580
 we could do almost nothing 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.230
 with them 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.880
 Well, now as promised I will show a couple 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.230
 battles 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.810
 who I remember in this clan 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.560
 cook both attacks were dragons and the first 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.950
 the battle which we see is an attack on 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.410
 number 3 attacked player mike broke a vase 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.480
 on 3 stars 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.950
 here is the shirt pretty strong dragons 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.320
 level 3 dragons they can quite easily 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.220
 destroy such a vase even though 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.100
 that there is a sixth level sex 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.730
 here's the first thing he does is throw off 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.600
 few fly and give a dragon to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.540
 brush a little way to the center of the base 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.700
 dragon creatures unpredictable they 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.360
 scatter in different directions behave 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.390
 not at all obediently a couple more of this drop 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.610
 line to kill faster 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.730
 lining standing buildings 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:22.030
 well, so already closer to the center 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:26.040
 passes about tactics will not 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:31.660
 much talk in this video because 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.660
 dragon attack meta attack more on 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.230
 good luck anyway i think so 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:44.290
 because at least they should 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:47.740
 to fly near knowledge but to practice 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.010
 far from it they do what they 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.010
 I want to 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.590
 therefore such an attack is an attack 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.580
 dragons she is part of luck too 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.659
 depends yes there you can somehow try 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.659
 send them 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.349
 and first knowledge on the sides let's say 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.780
 they did not fly in a circle but all this too 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.739
 it's pretty relative 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.079
 how to behave in the center of the map 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.190
 nobody knows why you see how 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.060
 not flown here 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.360
 town hall from two sides can be said 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.669
 demolished all useless unnecessary knowledge 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.010
 which are on the sides in the end 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.360
 there is only one sex with the opponent and three 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:45.820
 dragon if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:49.060
 but a couple of flies well, and mike mike at the end 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.880
 releases the heroes of their queen king 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.400
 Well, thank God only one dragon remains 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.110
 who basically finishes off who and 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.760
 helps heroes kill the last 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.340
 last tower wizard and last 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.340
 canon cannon well and so on 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.590
 last seconds 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.310
 here is this bunch comes a tale of a la here 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.410
 java soon a little 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.680
 You can congratulate Mike with a victory fight 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.480
 great it seems to me it was possible 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.460
 it's easy and simple to lose here but a hero 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.550
 also helps the queen especially on 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.400
 9 tons x years for a big plus and a second 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.980
 the battle which i show is attack on 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.480
 the seventh number attacked azik is our clan 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:38.370
 leader and see how it was 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.070
 lucky for him here not very much shot down 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:46.260
 99 percent and just a little bit 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.990
 enough until complete victory go into 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.430
 I will not get the details 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.100
 the beginning is very good 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.120
 makes measured and thoughtful 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.699
 a bit about soon 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.930
 in order to dwell on the key 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.330
 tipping point 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.990
 as you can see dragons just skating on 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.990
 base here 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.430
 in the right direction kill town hall and 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.060
 two on the sides and now is the moment 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.800
 when they just fly away 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:27.440
 both sides and drink the building around the circumference 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.729
 the one about the least is 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.600
 1 tower archers 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:35.240
 and in contrast to 4 dragons 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.090
 I can only say that this fight I watched 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.090
 online and could not fully believe it 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.310
 that will not bring down three stars here not 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.880
 will receive 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:49.110
 will not get a clear victory but as you can see a 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.900
 the dragons decided it was better to farm resources 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.000
 flew drink was kept from with elixir 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:59.230
 then of course helping the dragon 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.310
 and here it is the final resources end a 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:08.080
 the dragon just does not have time to fly photo 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:10.780
 99 percent whipped of course sad two 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.670
 the stars are also a good result and 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.240
 Unfortunately it happens that luck 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.490
 turns back to us therefore not 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.530
 despair 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:27.070
 play dragons they are pretty good yourself 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.990
 show sometimes what I wanted to say 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.660
 at last 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.000
 call a currently active leads 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.700
 a set of players since after each 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.440
 clan-war and we are cleaning people 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.360
 not quite raising for what they are here 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.370
 are needed 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.440
 so if you have town hall 7 or higher and 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.910
 at least one baroque you 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.060
 dragons come out 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.250
 plus there is enough 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.030
 amount of time for active participation 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.320
 in clanwars 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.280
 then knock us, we will be glad and 

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.490
 found turn 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.040
 be sure to accept well and on this 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.140
