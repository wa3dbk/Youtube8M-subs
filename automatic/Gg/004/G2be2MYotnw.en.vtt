00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:44.073
Comm Lee : Those kind of things.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:12.243

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:21.376
Wolf : Is it bad to not become a Master?
Bengi : How can you just say that out loud?

4 players cheer as their names weren't on the list.

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:28.931

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.642
Wolf : One sip...

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:57.477
20 year old Wolf almost lost his drink after saying 'by age."

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:03.532

Bengi is deeply into other people's shoulders. Worrying about others' shoulders.

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:36.782
Take these people out.

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:43.761

00:03:43.761 --> 00:03:50.049
Coach Kim : Bengi is prettier than a flower.
Bengi : Can you kick these people out?
Staff : Acting like you didn't hear it.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:04:00.685
Coach Kim : If you look him from the side, his nose looks like a nose that got a plastic surgery.
Bengi : God!!

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:08.883
Coach Kim : If he wear contacts, then he will look much better.

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:16.005

00:04:22.923 --> 00:04:26.102

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.283
I was surprised at myself.

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:44.713
Coach Kim : I laughed so much because of Bengi. I was about to talk about bans and picks with you,

00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:49.620
Coach Kim : I was like "Easyhoon~" and he came inside and sat on the chair.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.220
