00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
movement is as opposed to taking a clump

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.260 
movement is as opposed to taking a clump
off<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.130> would<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.610> an<00:02:40.940> overhand

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
off like you would in an overhand

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.010 
off like you would in an overhand
shuffle<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:42.850> group<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.000> cards<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.720> simply

shuffle a group of cards you just simply

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.250 
shuffle a group of cards you just simply
take<00:02:48.230> off<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.800> first<00:02:49.040> card<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.050> top

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
take off the first card on the top

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.290 
take off the first card on the top
obviously<00:02:51.590> that's<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.400> control<00:02:52.700> card<00:02:53.060> that's

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
obviously that's the control card that's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.660 
obviously that's the control card that's
the<00:02:53.600> card<00:02:53.810> we<00:02:53.959> want<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.290> come<00:02:54.470> once<00:02:55.190> maintain

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the card we want to come once maintain

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.449 
the card we want to come once maintain
controller<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.260> from<00:02:57.440> there<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.830> just<00:02:57.860> simply

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
controller so from there you just simply

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.860 
controller so from there you just simply
shuffle<00:02:59.150> out<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.900> rest<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.260> deck<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.780> we

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
shuffle out the rest of the deck and we

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.570 
shuffle out the rest of the deck and we
have<00:03:03.020> our<00:03:03.170> control<00:03:03.470> card<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> bottom

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
have our control card on the bottom

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.520 
have our control card on the bottom
ready<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.270> be<00:03:05.390> manipulated<00:03:06.350> if<00:03:06.470> needed<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.950> be

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
ready to be manipulated if needed to be

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.479 
ready to be manipulated if needed to be
Makita<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.920> move<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> card<00:03:10.430> back<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> top

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
Makita to move the card back to the top

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.310 
Makita to move the card back to the top
it's<00:03:13.489> quite<00:03:13.730> simple<00:03:15.130> we<00:03:16.130> just<00:03:16.280> shuffle<00:03:16.670> out

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
it's quite simple we just shuffle out

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.199 
it's quite simple we just shuffle out
normally

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
normally

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.220 
normally
and<00:03:19.390> ensuring<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.939> when<00:03:21.939> we<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> bot

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
and ensuring that when we get to the bot

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.759 
and ensuring that when we get to the bot
lore<00:03:23.709> part<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.189> the<00:03:24.250> deck<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:26.110> separate<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
lore part of the deck we separate the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.390 
lore part of the deck we separate the
bottom<00:03:27.099> card<00:03:27.459> which<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.510> our<00:03:28.629> control<00:03:29.019> card

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
bottom card which is our control card

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.199 
bottom card which is our control card
from<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.549> remainder<00:03:30.849> of<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> deck<00:03:33.060> drop<00:03:34.060> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
from the remainder of the deck drop the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.929 
from the remainder of the deck drop the
last<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> deck<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:35.319> top<00:03:35.349> and<00:03:35.799> then<00:03:36.549> replace

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
last of the deck on top and then replace

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.449 
last of the deck on top and then replace
the<00:03:37.870> controlled<00:03:38.290> card<00:03:38.560> back<00:03:38.920> on<00:03:39.069> top<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.400> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
the controlled card back on top of the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.530 
the controlled card back on top of the
deck<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:41.769> like<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.370> said<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.909> nice

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
deck so it's like I said it's a nice

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.949 
deck so it's like I said it's a nice
simple<00:03:44.019> very<00:03:44.650> easy<00:03:45.069> technique<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.790> know<00:03:46.090> but

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
simple very easy technique to know but

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.210 
simple very easy technique to know but
it<00:03:47.109> helps<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.409> move<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.650> card<00:03:47.859> around<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.459> a

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
it helps you move a card around in a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.339 
it helps you move a card around in a
somewhat<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.459> a<00:03:51.519> non<00:03:52.269> obvious<00:03:52.510> manner<00:03:52.930> or<00:03:53.139> less

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
somewhat on a non obvious manner or less

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.550 
somewhat on a non obvious manner or less
than<00:03:53.590> obvious<00:03:53.829> manner<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:55.060> just<00:03:56.049> at<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.230> normal

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
than obvious manner so just at a normal

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:06.960 
than obvious manner so just at a normal
pace<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.909> bottom<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.209> deck<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:05.970> then

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
pace to the bottom of the deck and then

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:19.410 
pace to the bottom of the deck and then
back<00:04:07.180> again<00:04:07.329> to<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.689> top

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.880 

obviously<00:04:20.420> when<00:04:20.690> you're<00:04:20.780> doing<00:04:20.989> these<00:04:21.110> card

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
obviously when you're doing these card

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.590 
obviously when you're doing these card
techniques<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.670> quality<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.210> cards<00:04:23.480> that

techniques the quality of the cards that
you're<00:04:23.720> using<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:25.040> very<00:04:25.790> relevant<00:04:26.210> if<00:04:27.200> you're

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
you're using is very relevant if you're

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.260 
you're using is very relevant if you're
using<00:04:27.710> an<00:04:27.920> old<00:04:28.100> set<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.400> cards<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.090> are<00:04:29.180> all

using an old set of cards that are all

tricks<00:04:35.180> aren't<00:04:35.390> going<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.570> go<00:04:35.660> as<00:04:35.810> smoothly

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
tricks aren't going to go as smoothly

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.950 
tricks aren't going to go as smoothly
it's<00:04:36.620> going<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:36.950> be<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.280> lot<00:04:38.090> harder<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.570> perform

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
it's going to be a lot harder to perform

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.180 
it's going to be a lot harder to perform
the<00:04:39.140> techniques<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:41.740> would<00:04:42.740> probably<00:04:42.920> go

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
the techniques I would probably go

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.580 
the techniques I would probably go
through<00:04:45.640> two<00:04:46.640> or<00:04:46.730> three<00:04:46.910> decks<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.300> cards

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
through two or three decks of cards

through two or three decks of cards
every<00:04:48.590> week<00:04:48.800> practicing<00:04:49.790> different

every week practicing different

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.910 
every week practicing different
techniques<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.380> mean<00:04:51.500> they're<00:04:51.650> only<00:04:51.740> about

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
techniques and I mean they're only about

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.810 
techniques and I mean they're only about
2<00:04:52.220> or<00:04:52.250> 3<00:04:52.310> bucks<00:04:53.260> or<00:04:54.260> you<00:04:55.190> know<00:04:55.310> anywhere

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
2 or 3 bucks or you know anywhere

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.210 
2 or 3 bucks or you know anywhere
between<00:04:55.880> two<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.390> five<00:04:56.600> bucks<00:04:56.960> for<00:04:57.290> a<00:04:57.650> decent

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
between two to five bucks for a decent

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.480 
between two to five bucks for a decent

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
set of cards and you know after you

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.160 
set of cards and you know after you
finish<00:05:01.760> using<00:05:02.090> for<00:05:02.720> learning<00:05:02.960> card

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
finish using for learning card

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.470 
finish using for learning card
techniques<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:04.160> can<00:05:04.280> play<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:05.030> can<00:05:05.180> sue<00:05:05.330> you

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
techniques you can play you can sue you

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.270 
techniques you can play you can sue you
then<00:05:05.630> play<00:05:05.840> games<00:05:06.140> poker<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.890> that<00:05:07.010> sort<00:05:07.220> of

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
then play games poker and that sort of

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.770 
then play games poker and that sort of
stuff<00:05:07.430> anyway<00:05:07.760> so<00:05:07.820> it's<00:05:08.120> not<00:05:08.240> a<00:05:08.300> huge<00:05:08.480> deal

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
stuff anyway so it's not a huge deal

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.740 
stuff anyway so it's not a huge deal
right<00:05:09.850> so<00:05:10.850> that's<00:05:10.970> simply<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:13.750> control

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
right so that's simply the the control

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.270 
right so that's simply the the control
of<00:05:14.960> moving<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.350> card<00:05:15.560> from<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.890> top<00:05:15.920> to<00:05:16.190> the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
of moving the card from the top to the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.770 
of moving the card from the top to the
bottom<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.850> from<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.270> bottom<00:05:17.510> to<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.750> top

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
bottom and from the bottom to the top

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.320 
bottom and from the bottom to the top
again

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
again

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.260 
again
the<00:05:20.330> next<00:05:20.570> video<00:05:20.780> that<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:21.020> do<00:05:21.110> will<00:05:21.770> be<00:05:22.270> the

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
the next video that I do will be the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.610 
the next video that I do will be the
riffle<00:05:23.840> shuffle<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:26.320> which<00:05:27.320> will<00:05:27.500> be<00:05:27.530> the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
riffle shuffle and which will be the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.100 
riffle shuffle and which will be the
proper<00:05:28.130> technique<00:05:28.550> itself<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.150> then<00:05:29.630> using

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
proper technique itself and then using

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.330
