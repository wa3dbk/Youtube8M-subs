00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.560
 the Hague 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.680
 between all companies by the color 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.990
 occasional time to be under fire 9 to add what do you think of this 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.589
 season 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.159
 well there are always the two things that turn around 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.349
 Well actually three things always look a lot done 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.160
 I always watch live and the stations can always play with him always 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.110
 and i get you 7 i was also nice that do well but ado my club is true 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.810
 its the shrinkage of being played for 15 hours 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.420
 string 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.300
 I actually see all the old age matches again or 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.380
 offer Saturday evening very late me because who I have so good football 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.510
 television 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.710
 and I have to say I think I am very happy that all learning paths are the right ones 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.960
 players may have had 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.270
 that they could have used one of mine on the right so I hoped 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.700
 a few weeks ago when the cobblestone strips 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.980
 then year when the cupboard will be one for example 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.770
 when inhalers haag anp hope to create 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.950
 that it will continue I do not believe it was successful but that was perhaps 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770
 fit is fit 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.150
 have been a good player of trade I have also spoken with appropriate to that 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.440
 of course also wants after England 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.560
 yes I have got things crackled in the last few weeks on this year 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.880
 recovered 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.320
 the city was seventeen places plus the fact that he must get fit again and me 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.800
 find her from brook too 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.780
 ideal club for him to get fit again 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.590
 open the normal time 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.940
 but if I go to a system yes sometimes doctor typical haagse is sometimes a bit grumpy 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.660
 and you saw that, for example, in various opposites, but there was also 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.590
 sat with it 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 and also last year and I am very sorry that a voucher was of course very good 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.620
 good team that 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.860
 as a result and by means of an all-in-one child benefit to the left 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.320
 left winger that then tunneling hour 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.810
 yes that one then went away and in midfield they had 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.280
 7 though they even had parents and they had pj fries 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.409
 After all, walk and tower street that was nevertheless one of the best midfielder 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.410
 from The Netherlands 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.790
 but I think they didn't proclaim that way 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.069
 that is in our time went for japan that says that have convex 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.890
 then they do that too and that these kidney cells certainly fed that last leftover 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.789
 against ajax 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.739
 with not because all ajax as roma i for it i feel it 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.960
 actually fantastic to see what they grabbed them at home 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.619
 also created opportunities 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.109
 second half I think that you can no longer dress the file 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.179
 take it a bit slower but I was left with a fiction 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.669
 but i really like watching her car and i just hope she does 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.239
 also leaving that trainer a bit alone but yes that is inherent in mine 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.529
 profession because I see that those stijnen fabrics hague youngsters 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.800
 and now we play football 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.509
 emmen assen the asser the players are doing well 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.639
 and that is what it is all about if the players are not doing well 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.679
 but I fear the players have so 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.339
 the young oaks morals mayer meijers 9 meijers 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.829
 and in midfield even have eating disorder stadium 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.779
 maybe not as plays as the two municipalities where very much 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.199
 interested men 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.109
 but i follow them all i follow that 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.389
 that boy of the well without the municipality alone but we do know one 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.489
 protocol building something again 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.029
 that series 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.689
 those for those follow wherever because the apache because there will just be a good one 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.939
 so they have the almerse book 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.919
 those who walk long in the back that belga ypu 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.159
 yes that at is the first match against ohl made birthday karst tates against ajax 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.479
 that they are 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.329
 He also said they also have new ones he was believing when he was eighteen 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.369
 goals so stand but in short you notice wonderful lessons and was still crazy 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.189
 achieve a result 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.120
 normally they do not win and keep playing very well and is what makes you 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.479
 goal penalties 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.619
 so so a quote follow i also had just closely
