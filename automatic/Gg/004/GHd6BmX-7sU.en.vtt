00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 Today at the most blatant 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.880
 later you write so without 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.619
 learn good grades 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.480
 Let's start with the classic you give 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.039
 simply the most important data or 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 formula and shrinks the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.670
 font size so far that you are fine 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 but can not read much space 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.900
 Needed if you are on the safe side 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 you can then also the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 change font color to gray so that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 your later by not only wide 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.100
 good hiding place for this 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 For example, classics are in the pocket calculator 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.020
 under the ruler or in the sleeve 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 most of the time you have to go to a klausur 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 have his mobile phone while doing mobile phones 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 a huge save you everything 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.280
 can deny what you need to know 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 So how about if you just yours 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 old wheel gives and another in his 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 pants pocket or girl hiding on 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.079
 the mobile phone you can then calls clausur 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.059
 all important data for example in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.040
 a pdf file save quite a bit 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 but it fits in well with yours 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 mobile phone silently or even better in the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.140
 flying mode is not coming 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.080
 good then loses during the exam 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.229
 get a message and a runner 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.540
 6 leave school leaving the next 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.000
 Player is something for real photoshop 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 professionals first you need a bottle 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 with a non-transparent label 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.590
 you know this label and one 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 then edit it with photoshop 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.950
 instead of the ingredients you write 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.869
 the most important data or formulas 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 the label and stick it on the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.670
 bottle of the far everyone will think you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.619
 stars the thought his water bottle 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.479
 but actually you are looking for the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.610
 a formula you just not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.869
 the more obvious the spicker 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.579
 the lower is the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.470
 chance that he will notice 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.180
 write what you need to know yet 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.829
 just right on the blackboard 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.720
 if you have a few unimportant things 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.240
 writing around it falls to the teacher 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.890
 only less on most teachers 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.600
 will look at a similar board 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 During the exam, they usually sit 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.409
 with her back to it and the best part 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.210
 this later is that of the teacher himself 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.500
 if he does not punish anyone 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.020
 can not because retrace 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.150
 who has written the blackboard 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.010
 a place where a teacher guarantees 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.620
 no cheat sheet is suspect is 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.930
 under your you heard right 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.580
 just the cheat sheet with tesa film on 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.680
 stick the chair between your legs 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.239
 if you want to look something up then 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.140
 you just have to briefly your legs 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.330
 spread 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 but you have to pay attention to this method 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.599
 to be in the room in front of your teacher and allowed 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.400
 Only when he comes to the room again 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.269
 left because just go to the toilet 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.269
 is not in it then 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.019
 Of course we do not want to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.849
 to ask for a spit better than to spit 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.130
 It is always really used to learning 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.810
 our tips so only in an emergency when 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.790
 Your help with learning then needs to look 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.829
 but just about our simple just over 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.720
 here is the coolest aria for 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.790
 Germany in math chemistry physics and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.620
 Biology simply on one of the symbols 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.620
 and we will hear each other again soon 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.540
 so that 's it 6 damn shit 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.540
 I did make out of said normal 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 laugh
