00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.130 

that<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.360> adventure<00:02:05.630> team<00:02:07.570> one<00:02:08.570> more<00:02:08.750> time

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.720 

and<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.320> someone<00:02:12.770> lost<00:02:12.950> looking<00:02:13.340> at<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.490> first

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.350 
and as someone lost looking at the first
video<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:15.040> didn't<00:02:16.040> get<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> good<00:02:16.430> shot<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.970> all<00:02:17.120> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
video I didn't get a good shot of all of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.020 
video I didn't get a good shot of all of
them<00:02:17.680> some<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:19.010> didn't<00:02:19.250> even<00:02:19.400> shoot<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.850> head

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.680 

ma<00:03:25.710> now<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.010> probably<00:03:26.490> named<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.850> couple<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.540> them

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
ma now I probably named a couple of them

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.830 
ma now I probably named a couple of them
you<00:03:28.310> know<00:03:29.310> more<00:03:29.580> than<00:03:29.730> once<00:03:30.000> hopefully<00:03:30.810> I

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
you know more than once hopefully I

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.660 
you know more than once hopefully I
didn't<00:03:31.410> do<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.680> too<00:03:31.860> much<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.310> caught<00:03:32.490> myself

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
didn't do that too much I caught myself

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.720 
didn't do that too much I caught myself
a<00:03:33.000> couple<00:03:33.330> times<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:34.560> hopefully<00:03:35.340> didn't<00:03:35.610> miss

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
a couple times and hopefully didn't miss

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.690 
a couple times and hopefully didn't miss
any<00:03:36.380> they're<00:03:37.380> scattered<00:03:37.890> out<00:03:40.160> no<00:03:41.160> real<00:03:41.370> rhyme

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
any they're scattered out no real rhyme

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.540 
any they're scattered out no real rhyme
or<00:03:42.000> reason<00:03:42.860> what<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.890> tried<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:46.550> starting

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
or reason what I tried to do is starting

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.830 
or reason what I tried to do is starting
in<00:03:48.560> 1970<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.830> front<00:03:50.160> row<00:03:50.630> didn't<00:03:51.630> quite

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
in 1970 is the front row didn't quite

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.500 
in 1970 is the front row didn't quite
end<00:03:51.870> up<00:03:52.230> what<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.580> expected<00:03:53.580> but<00:03:53.790> for<00:03:54.240> the<00:03:54.330> most

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
end up what I expected but for the most

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.420 
end up what I expected but for the most
part<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.550> earlier<00:03:57.620> through<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.740> later<00:03:58.980> so

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
part it's earlier through the later so

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.590 
part it's earlier through the later so
the<00:03:59.550> back<00:03:59.730> row<00:04:00.000> would<00:04:00.150> be<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.830> 1976<00:04:02.570> with<00:04:03.570> the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
the back row would be the 1976 with the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.210 
the back row would be the 1976 with the
exception<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.350> boxes<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.310> course<00:04:07.220> they

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
exception of the boxes of course they

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.110 
exception of the boxes of course they
range<00:04:08.550> all<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.970> way<00:04:09.120> through

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.440 

that's<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.440> Thanks
