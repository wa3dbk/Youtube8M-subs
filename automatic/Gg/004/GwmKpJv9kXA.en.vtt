trying to say is a spawn trap like that
doesn't<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.189> happen<00:01:59.520> it<00:02:00.329> takes<00:02:00.689> people<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
doesn't just happen it takes people to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.700 
doesn't just happen it takes people to
fail<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.250> their<00:02:02.490> side<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.659> takes<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.170> lot<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
fail on their side it takes a lot of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
fail on their side it takes a lot of
failures<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:05.820> teams<00:02:06.119> side<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
failures on the other teams side the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.869 
failures on the other teams side the
other<00:02:06.570> team<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.320> can't<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.250> any<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
other team just can't have any kind of

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.889 
other team just can't have any kind of
physical<00:02:09.090> chance<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.959> begin<00:02:10.259> with

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
physical chance to begin with

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.960 
physical chance to begin with
it's<00:02:11.709> not<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.099> you're<00:02:12.250> gonna<00:02:12.370> take<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> good

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
it's not like you're gonna take a good

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.809 
it's not like you're gonna take a good
team<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.480> spawn<00:02:13.690> trapped<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.560> that

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
team and spawn trapped and like that

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.509 
team and spawn trapped and like that
if<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:17.110> sponsor<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.920> team<00:02:18.099> like<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
if you sponsor up a team like that

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.250 
if you sponsor up a team like that
pretty<00:02:19.120> much<00:02:19.269> for<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.569> whole<00:02:19.780> point<00:02:20.170> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
pretty much for the whole point is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.479 
pretty much for the whole point is
you've<00:02:23.260> already<00:02:23.440> won<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.769> game<00:02:23.950> anyway<00:02:26.489> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
you've already won the game anyway the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.589 
you've already won the game anyway the
other<00:02:27.640> themes<00:02:27.940> you're<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.239> going<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.510> take

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
other themes you're just going to take

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.780 
other themes you're just going to take
it<00:02:28.720> as<00:02:28.840> loss<00:02:29.110> if<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.280> stay<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it as loss if they want to stay in and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.979 
it as loss if they want to stay in and
think<00:02:30.970> try<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> pull<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> stuff<00:02:31.750> out<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
think try to pull the stuff out of the

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.920 
think try to pull the stuff out of the
spawn<00:02:32.260> trap<00:02:32.500> they<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.799> do<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.269> but<00:02:34.269> for<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
spawn trap they can do that but for the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.050 
spawn trap they can do that but for the
most<00:02:35.079> part<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.950> takes<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.489> while<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.730> get<00:02:37.000> to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
most part it takes a while to get to

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.390 
most part it takes a while to get to
that<00:02:37.269> point<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.379> a<00:02:38.739> lot<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.010> argument

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
that point and this is a lot of argument

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.069 
that point and this is a lot of argument
mainly<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> battlefield<00:02:40.299> for<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.810> because

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
mainly a battlefield for this because

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.289 
mainly a battlefield for this because
how<00:02:41.530> many<00:02:41.590> times<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.549> seen<00:02:42.760> battlefield

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
how many times have you seen battlefield

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.990 
how many times have you seen battlefield
videos<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.780> people<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.109> the<00:02:44.200> helicopter<00:02:44.799> just

basically circling around a base killing

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.930 
basically circling around a base killing
people<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.190> they<00:02:48.340> spawn

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940

to respawn in their main base and at
that<00:03:23.410> point<00:03:23.769> they're<00:03:24.130> pushed<00:03:24.430> back<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
that point they're pushed back to the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.599 
that point they're pushed back to the
point<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.359> no<00:03:25.510> return<00:03:25.859> there's<00:03:26.859> only<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.250> spot

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
point of no return there's only one spot

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.789 
point of no return there's only one spot
on<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.790> map<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.090> they<00:03:28.510> physically<00:03:29.500> can<00:03:29.620> own

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
on the map that they physically can own

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.080 
on the map that they physically can own
and<00:03:30.129> a<00:03:30.160> little<00:03:30.340> reason<00:03:30.519> they<00:03:30.609> own<00:03:30.790> that's

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and a little reason they own that's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.580 
and a little reason they own that's
because<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.540> game<00:03:31.750> will<00:03:31.900> not<00:03:31.959> allow<00:03:32.349> them

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
because the game will not allow them

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.869 
because the game will not allow them
just<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.829> get<00:03:32.980> kicked<00:03:33.190> out<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.489> game<00:03:33.669> for

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
just to get kicked out the game for

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.199 
just to get kicked out the game for
getting<00:03:34.120> beat<00:03:34.239> down<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.970> kind<00:03:37.150> of

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
getting beat down and that's kind of

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.819 
getting beat down and that's kind of
like<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.450> tug<00:03:37.629> of<00:03:37.780> war<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:40.299> in<00:03:40.510> Fairplay

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
like the tug of war you it's in Fairplay

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.270
