right<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> believe<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.880> Microsoft's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
right now I believe that Microsoft's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.190 
right now I believe that Microsoft's
trying<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> buy<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
trying to buy that out and make it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.580 
trying to buy that out and make it
exclusive<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> Xbox<00:01:08.220> 720<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.750> if

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
exclusive to the Xbox 720 so if

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
exclusive to the Xbox 720 so if
Microsoft<00:01:10.950> can't<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> making<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
Microsoft can't do it if I have making a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
Microsoft can't do it if I have making a
better<00:01:12.780> quality<00:01:13.080> product<00:01:13.560> they'll<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.250> by

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
better quality product they'll do it by

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
better quality product they'll do it by

about it and I can't picture any company
with<00:02:27.390> common<00:02:27.780> sense<00:02:27.990> unless<00:02:28.800> Microsoft<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
with common sense unless Microsoft is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.810 
with common sense unless Microsoft is
gonna<00:02:29.970> throw<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:30.990> cash<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:31.560> them<00:02:31.820> it

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
gonna throw that much cash at them it

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.270 
gonna throw that much cash at them it
would<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.020> Xbox<00:02:34.500> 720<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
would just make it for the Xbox 720 and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.620 
would just make it for the Xbox 720 and
even<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.520> they<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:35.670> throw<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.180> insane<00:02:36.480> amount

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
even if they do throw an insane amount

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
even if they do throw an insane amount
of<00:02:36.840> cash<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.230> still<00:02:37.530> may<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.710> more<00:02:38.130> profitable

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
of cash it still may be more profitable

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.240 
of cash it still may be more profitable
for<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> make<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.050> game<00:02:40.260> multi-platform

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
for them to make the game multi-platform

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.340 
for them to make the game multi-platform
so<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:42.030> don't<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.630> how<00:02:42.780> much<00:02:42.990> truth

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
so I just I don't know how much truth

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.750

unless Microsoft is really really gonna
be<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.050> two<00:02:49.350> hundred

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
make more money going multi-platform

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.270 
make more money going multi-platform
yeah<00:03:03.540> I'll<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.750> make<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.080> for<00:03:04.410> your<00:03:04.560> your

yeah I'll just make it for your your

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
yeah I'll just make it for your your
system<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.030> mean<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.510> been<00:03:06.780> done<00:03:07.020> in<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> past

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
system I mean it's been done in the past

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.220 
system I mean it's been done in the past
before<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:09.000> different<00:03:09.630> market<00:03:09.870> now

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
before but it's a different market now

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.620 
before but it's a different market now
it's<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.620> different<00:03:11.040> economy<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.390> just

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
it's a different economy and I just

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.210 
it's a different economy and I just
don't<00:03:12.840> see<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.260> being<00:03:13.410> practical<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.160> I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
don't see this being practical and I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.949 
don't see this being practical and I
don't<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.520> Microsoft<00:03:14.760> even<00:03:15.390> with<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> amount

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
don't see Microsoft even with the amount

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.380 
don't see Microsoft even with the amount
of<00:03:16.050> cash<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.260> they<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.880> wanting<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.180> do

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
of cash that they have wanting to do

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.630 
of cash that they have wanting to do
this<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.080> doesn't<00:03:19.950> really<00:03:20.100> make<00:03:20.459> any

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
this it just doesn't really make any

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.210 
this it just doesn't really make any
sense<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.540> what's<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.230> matter<00:03:22.440> Microsoft

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
sense so what's the matter Microsoft

I<00:03:38.130> mean<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.730> had<00:03:38.910> with<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.209> produced

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
I mean you had with the produced

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.940 
I mean you had with the produced
generation<00:03:40.110> he<00:03:40.200> had<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.440> fact<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.769> your

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
generation he had the fact that your

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.710 
generation he had the fact that your
system<00:03:41.250> was<00:03:41.370> easier<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.700> program<00:03:42.000> for<00:03:42.450> than

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
system was easier to program for than

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.960 
system was easier to program for than
the<00:03:42.870> Cell<00:03:43.290> processor<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.130> ps3<00:03:44.430> but

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
the Cell processor and the ps3 but

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.880 
the Cell processor and the ps3 but
that's<00:03:45.570> all<00:03:45.810> thrown<00:03:46.080> out<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> window<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.830> I
