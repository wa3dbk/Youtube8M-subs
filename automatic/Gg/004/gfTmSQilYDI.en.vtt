00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
that's a very bad sign it's one thing if

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.210

of<00:03:11.799> shots<00:03:12.129> so<00:03:12.489> right<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.909> think<00:03:13.000> mentally

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
of shots so right now I think mentally

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.080

he's<00:03:14.019> not<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.590> good<00:03:14.769> place<00:03:14.950> if<00:03:15.310> he<00:03:15.670> doesn't

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
he's not in a good place if he doesn't

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.490

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
obviously have college didn't love I

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.430 
obviously have college didn't love I
don't<00:03:19.690> think<00:03:19.870> there's<00:03:19.989> enough<00:03:20.200> firepower

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
don't think there's enough firepower

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.349 
don't think there's enough firepower
there<00:03:20.920> if<00:03:21.040> ship<00:03:21.220> doesn't<00:03:21.459> play<00:03:21.730> well<00:03:21.909> Steve

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359
