00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
we have that that you know the new

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.529 
we have that that you know the new
folder<00:00:15.690> where<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.770> create<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.130> new<00:00:17.160> folder

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
folder where you can create a new folder

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.910 
folder where you can create a new folder
i<00:00:18.539> would<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.590> them<00:00:19.949> new<00:00:20.279> barracks<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
i would use all of them new barracks and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.109 
i would use all of them new barracks and
there's<00:00:22.920> probably<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> character<00:00:23.730> limit<00:00:23.910> i

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
there's probably a character limit i

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.759 
there's probably a character limit i
think<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.539> about<00:00:24.750> 20<00:00:25.109> characters<00:00:25.410> i

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
think it's about 20 characters i

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.380 
think it's about 20 characters i

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.020 
passwords and that's important to me and
that's<00:04:53.440> why<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.740> built<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.220> in<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:56.910> that's<00:04:57.910> about
