stateside as well where she's massive

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640

both<00:00:11.580> both<00:00:11.940> sides<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> pond<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
both both sides of the pond what do you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.700 
both both sides of the pond what do you
think<00:00:13.830> makes<00:00:14.099> her<00:00:14.340> jeans<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.820> successful<00:00:15.480> I

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
think makes her jeans so successful I

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.529 
think makes her jeans so successful I
think<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.070> key<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.150> she's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> woman

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
think the key is is that she's a woman

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.420 
think the key is is that she's a woman
herself<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.470> she<00:00:19.529> knows<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.070> kind<00:00:20.310> of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
herself and so she knows the kind of

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.029 
herself and so she knows the kind of
issues<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.150> lot<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> us<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.650> buying

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
issues that a lot of us have with buying

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
issues that a lot of us have with buying
maybe<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.119> off<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.420> peg<00:00:24.600> jeans<00:00:24.960> quite<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> lot

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
maybe just off the peg jeans quite a lot

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.439 
maybe just off the peg jeans quite a lot
at<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> time<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.460> waistband<00:00:26.970> will<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> bit

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
at the time the waistband will be a bit

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
at the time the waistband will be a bit
too<00:00:27.630> low<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.170> even<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> super<00:00:29.189> skinny<00:00:29.460> with

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
too low so even if you super skinny with

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.370 
too low so even if you super skinny with
some<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.000> those<00:00:30.119> jeans<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> muffin

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
some of those jeans you can get a muffin

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.459 
some of those jeans you can get a muffin
top<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.239> sew<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.809> much<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> do

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
top and sew it so it's not so much to do

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
top and sew it so it's not so much to do
with<00:00:34.620> our<00:00:35.250> shape<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:35.910> end<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.149> feeling<00:00:36.450> bad

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with our shape and we end up feeling bad

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
with our shape and we end up feeling bad
about<00:00:36.809> ourselves<00:00:37.110> thinking<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.010> can't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
about ourselves thinking that we can't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
about ourselves thinking that we can't
wear<00:00:38.489> jeans<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.899> she<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
wear jeans but I think that she really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.369 
wear jeans but I think that she really
invites<00:00:40.770> every<00:00:41.190> woman<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.750> try<00:00:42.750> jeans<00:00:43.140> again

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
invites every woman to try jeans again

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
invites every woman to try jeans again
and<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.700> live<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.180> when

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
and you then you can live in them when

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
and you then you can live in them when
you<00:00:45.420> find<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> pair<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.410> fit<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> well

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
you find a pair that really fit you well

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
you find a pair that really fit you well
like<00:00:47.460> hers<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.660> feel<00:00:48.870> great<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.350> them

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like hers do and you feel great in them

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
like hers do and you feel great in them
then<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.340> why<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.670> earth<00:00:50.700> didn't<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.329> try
