how<00:00:27.250> long's<00:00:27.490> it<00:00:27.610> been<00:00:27.670> I<00:00:27.910> think<00:00:28.120> we're

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
how long's it been I think we're

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.490 
how long's it been I think we're
obligated<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.840> come<00:00:28.900> to<00:00:29.020> every<00:00:29.140> packs<00:00:29.320> now

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
obligated to come to every packs now

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.700 
obligated to come to every packs now
what<00:00:29.620> is<00:00:29.710> this<00:00:29.830> number<00:00:30.810> 52<00:00:31.810> here<00:00:32.020> for<00:00:32.349> this<00:00:32.590> is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
what is this number 52 here for this is

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
what is this number 52 here for this is
number<00:00:32.829> four<00:00:33.070> actually<00:00:33.429> I<00:00:33.460> think<00:00:33.489> it's<00:00:33.609> the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
number four actually I think it's the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.639 
number four actually I think it's the
opposite<00:00:34.120> way<00:00:34.269> I<00:00:34.300> think<00:00:34.449> that<00:00:34.719> we<00:00:35.170> got<00:00:35.409> into

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
opposite way I think that we got into

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.989 
opposite way I think that we got into
packs<00:00:35.859> in<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.159> first<00:00:36.429> one<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.670> now<00:00:36.879> they

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
packs in the first one and now they

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.970 
packs in the first one and now they
can't<00:00:37.149> get<00:00:37.269> rid<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.420> us<00:00:37.629> it's<00:00:38.199> like<00:00:38.350> like<00:00:38.859> they

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
can't get rid of us it's like like they

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.169 
can't get rid of us it's like like they
feel<00:00:39.100> bad<00:00:39.339> if<00:00:39.489> they<00:00:39.579> get<00:00:39.699> rid<00:00:39.819> of<00:00:39.850> us<00:00:39.999> somehow

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
feel bad if they get rid of us somehow

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.819 
feel bad if they get rid of us somehow

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
I think so far the highlight of the show

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.240 
I think so far the highlight of the show
this<00:01:00.940> year<00:01:01.000> has<00:01:01.480> been<00:01:01.800> finishing<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.010> setup

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250

this year has been finishing the setup
of<00:01:03.309> our<00:01:03.430> booth<00:01:04.199> since<00:01:05.199> we<00:01:05.320> exhibit<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.799> don't

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
of our booth since we exhibit I don't

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.810 
of our booth since we exhibit I don't
really<00:01:06.159> get<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.340> see<00:01:06.460> very<00:01:06.640> much

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
really get to see very much

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.359

unfortunately<00:01:07.180> so<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.560> know<00:01:08.680> setting<00:01:09.100> up<00:01:09.220> I

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
unfortunately so you know setting up I

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.280
