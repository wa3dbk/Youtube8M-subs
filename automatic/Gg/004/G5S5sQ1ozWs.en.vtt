your way
so<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:41.880> doing<00:00:42.060> do<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.240> just<00:00:42.600> weld<00:00:42.900> some

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so what we're doing do is just weld some

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680 
so what we're doing do is just weld some
tabs<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.310> and<00:00:44.760> hold<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.510> place

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
tabs down here and hold it in place

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
tabs down here and hold it in place
while<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.230> try<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.590> fake<00:00:46.890> rim<00:00:47.400> and<00:00:47.670> knock

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
while we try out fake rim and knock

00:00:47.820 --> 00:01:11.870 
while we try out fake rim and knock
everything<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.390> place<00:01:09.710> trade<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.700> where

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
everything in place trade up right where

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
everything in place trade up right where
we<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.329> now<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.259> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we want it now what we're going to do is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
we want it now what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:13.859> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.009> bevel<00:01:14.429> grain<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.389> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
we're going to bevel grain and of the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.289 
we're going to bevel grain and of the
plate<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.499> reason<00:01:16.829> the<00:01:17.280> reason<00:01:17.729> being<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
plate the reason the reason being is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.289 
plate the reason the reason being is
being<00:01:18.719> is<00:01:19.139> when<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.249> get<00:01:20.999> pieces

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
being is when you will get pieces

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.859 
being is when you will get pieces
together<00:01:21.829> you<00:01:22.829> don't<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.249> there<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.659> up<00:01:24.659> on

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
together you don't want there to up on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.550 
together you don't want there to up on
there<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.469> need<00:01:25.709> a<00:01:25.740> bit<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:27.350> angle<00:01:28.350> like

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
there you need a bit of a angle like

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.949 
there you need a bit of a angle like
this<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.399> so<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.969> weld<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.749> in

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
this right here so the weld will go in

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.050 
this right here so the weld will go in
right<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.249> just<00:01:32.490> go<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.880> don't

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
right here if you just go like don't

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090 
right here if you just go like don't
have<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> gap<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> gap<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.649> there<00:01:34.889> but

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
have a gap don't have a gap in there but

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.529 
have a gap don't have a gap in there but
welds<00:01:35.429> got<00:01:35.609> nowhere<00:01:35.999> to<00:01:36.030> go

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
welds got nowhere to go

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.389 
welds got nowhere to go
then<00:01:37.049> you'll<00:01:37.229> grind<00:01:37.469> off<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.799> weld<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.279> you

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
then you'll grind off the weld and you

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.519 
then you'll grind off the weld and you
basically<00:01:38.549> won't<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.060> anything<00:01:39.270> silver<00:01:39.899> so

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529 
basically won't have anything silver so

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.800 
basically won't have anything silver so
we're<00:01:40.679> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.859> bevel<00:01:41.279> the<00:01:41.310> edge<00:01:41.609> and<00:01:41.999> then

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
we're going to bevel the edge and then

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.359 
we're going to bevel the edge and then
we're<00:01:42.959> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.109> have<00:01:43.229> Clair<00:01:43.619> well<00:01:43.889> to<00:01:44.100> stick

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
we're going to have Clair well to stick

00:01:44.369 --> 00:02:50.430 
we're going to have Clair well to stick
to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440
