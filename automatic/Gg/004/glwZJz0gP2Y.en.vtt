in this video I'll be participating in
the<00:00:06.870> whooping<00:00:07.140> space<00:00:07.379> itself<00:00:07.710> by<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.250> f-15s

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910

MT diesel engine yeah
now<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.580> stage<00:00:12.059> has<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> hybrid<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.900> ground

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
now this stage has a hybrid of ground

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.650 
now this stage has a hybrid of ground
targets<00:00:13.620> many<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> which<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.460> high<00:00:14.969> value<00:00:15.330> SP

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.330 
targets many of which are high value SP
fighters<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.920> highly<00:00:17.220> recommended

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340

for<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> next<00:01:00.660> step<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.960> that's<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> spot<00:01:01.789> now

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
for the next step so that's the spot now

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.820 
for the next step so that's the spot now
the<00:01:02.850> next<00:01:03.149> set<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> targets<00:01:03.660> consist<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> large

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the next set of targets consist of large

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340 
the next set of targets consist of large
numbers<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> yellow<00:01:05.909> targets<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
numbers of yellow targets so this is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
numbers of yellow targets so this is
where<00:01:07.500> four<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.860> jumps<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.880> can

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
where four is jumps if you have them can

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.280 
where four is jumps if you have them can
come<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:09.930> handy

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
come in really handy

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.840 
come in really handy
but<00:01:10.620> I<00:01:10.650> decided<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.190> ignore<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.730> head

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
but I decided to ignore them and head

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.590

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
missile silos and it is the to help

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.500 
missile silos and it is the to help
the<00:04:41.410> facilities<00:04:41.890> up<00:04:42.040> top<00:04:42.220> however<00:04:42.970> if<00:04:43.390> you

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
the facilities up top however if you

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.790 
the facilities up top however if you
have<00:04:43.600> fast<00:04:43.810> food<00:04:43.930> shouting<00:04:44.320> weapons<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:44.740> you

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
have fast food shouting weapons so you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.320 
have fast food shouting weapons so you
can<00:04:44.920> clear<00:04:45.130> up<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.400> enemies<00:04:45.670> up<00:04:45.790> top<00:04:46.000> and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
can clear up the enemies up top and

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.790 
can clear up the enemies up top and
still<00:04:46.600> make<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.840> down<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.230> beach<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.410> clear

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
still make it down to the beach to clear

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:59.920 
still make it down to the beach to clear
up<00:04:47.890> missiles<00:04:48.580> before<00:04:48.700> anyone<00:04:49.420> else<00:04:49.540> can

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.280 

so<00:05:00.830> that's<00:05:01.190> all<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.610> SP<00:05:01.910> ground<00:05:02.270> targets<00:05:02.630> time

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
so that's all the SP ground targets time

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.600 
so that's all the SP ground targets time
to<00:05:03.410> go<00:05:03.530> clear<00:05:03.740> up<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.919> rest<00:05:04.100> of<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.280> map

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
as I've said earlier I have the missile

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160 
as I've said earlier I have the missile
silo<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.550> facilities<00:05:16.060> variation<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:16.930> map

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
silo and facilities variation this map

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.660 
silo and facilities variation this map
there<00:05:17.530> are<00:05:17.590> two<00:05:17.680> other<00:05:17.860> variations<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
there are two other variations of the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.560 
there are two other variations of the
second<00:05:18.910> half<00:05:19.060> as<00:05:19.210> well

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
second half as well

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.420 
second half as well
hello<00:05:20.020> them<00:05:20.200> is<00:05:20.320> just<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.620> missile<00:05:20.860> silos<00:05:21.130> only

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
hello them is just a missile silos only

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.520 
hello them is just a missile silos only
and<00:05:21.670> instead<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.090> facilities<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:22.900> have<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.260> lot

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
and instead of facilities you have a lot

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.380 
and instead of facilities you have a lot
of<00:05:23.560> air<00:05:23.890> targets<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.820> third<00:05:25.000> bearing<00:05:25.270> in

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
of air targets and the third bearing in

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.820 
of air targets and the third bearing in
the<00:05:25.450> ship<00:05:25.660> doesn't<00:05:25.990> have<00:05:26.200> missile<00:05:26.470> silos<00:05:26.710> at

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
the ship doesn't have missile silos at

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.890 
the ship doesn't have missile silos at
all<00:05:26.950> instead<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.940> have<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.090> bunch<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.450> armories

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
all instead you have a bunch of armories

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.420 
all instead you have a bunch of armories
and<00:05:28.930> facilities<00:05:29.590> should<00:05:29.680> be<00:05:29.830> here<00:05:30.040> in

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
and facilities should be here in

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.780 
and facilities should be here in
