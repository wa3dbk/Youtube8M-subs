double teaming him and trapping him we

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.610 
double teaming him and trapping him we
haven't<00:00:33.030> faced<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.390> lot<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.660> wings<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.170> season

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
haven't faced a lot of wings this season

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.840 
haven't faced a lot of wings this season
where<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> Celtics<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.399> necessarily

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
where the Celtics have necessarily

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.119 
where the Celtics have necessarily
needed<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.989> particularly<00:00:37.770> because

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
needed to do that particularly because

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.470 
needed to do that particularly because
they<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.550> some<00:00:38.760> very<00:00:38.969> good<00:00:39.090> perimeter

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
they have some very good perimeter

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
defenders and Gerald Wallace and Jeff

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
defenders and Gerald Wallace and Jeff
Green<00:00:41.700> they're<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.149> good<00:00:42.420> one-on-one<00:00:42.960> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Green they're very good one-on-one in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840 
Green they're very good one-on-one in
those<00:00:43.530> situations<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.309> they're<00:00:44.520> gonna<00:00:44.610> need

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
those situations but they're gonna need

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
those situations but they're gonna need
to<00:00:44.969> send<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.329> extra<00:00:45.600> defenders<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

only way to slow him down he's shooting
better<00:00:50.820> than<00:00:50.940> sixty-three<00:00:51.629> percent<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.110> his

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
better than sixty-three percent in his

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020 
better than sixty-three percent in his
last<00:00:52.379> two<00:00:52.559> games<00:00:52.829> he's<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.219> fire<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
last two games he's on fire and the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.160 
last two games he's on fire and the
Celtics<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> need<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> figure<00:00:55.050> out

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
Celtics are going to need to figure out

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
Celtics are going to need to figure out
a<00:00:55.260> way<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.829> slow<00:00:56.039> him<00:00:56.219> down<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.640> else<00:00:56.730> they're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
a way to slow him down or else they're

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.279 
a way to slow him down or else they're
not<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> grab<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> how<00:00:58.230> do

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you think Jeff Green will match up with

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.180 
you think Jeff Green will match up with
Carmelo<00:01:00.329> today<00:01:00.719> well<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.649> back<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:02.039> the

playoff series last season yeah Carmelo

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
playoff series last season yeah Carmelo
Anthony<00:01:04.350> outscore<00:01:05.189> Jeff<00:01:05.489> Green<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.210> Jeff

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
Anthony outscore Jeff Green but Jeff

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
Anthony outscore Jeff Green but Jeff
Green<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> better<00:01:07.020> player<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
Green was the better player in that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
Green was the better player in that
series<00:01:07.799> there's<00:01:08.040> no<00:01:08.189> doubt<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.820> he<00:01:09.060> shot

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
series there's no doubt about it he shot

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.609 
series there's no doubt about it he shot
better<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> field<00:01:10.049> he<00:01:10.200> shot<00:01:10.409> better

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
better from the field he shot better

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
better from the field he shot better
from<00:01:10.860> three-point<00:01:11.310> range<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.880> were

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
from three-point range they were

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.789 
from three-point range they were
basically<00:01:12.360> even<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.900> rebounding<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
basically even with rebounding and and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.170 
basically even with rebounding and and
you<00:01:14.100> got<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> fact<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you got to think about the fact that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.730 
you got to think about the fact that
Carmelo<00:01:15.780> didn't<00:01:16.049> shoot<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.229> because<00:01:16.710> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
Carmelo didn't shoot well because of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
Carmelo didn't shoot well because of
Jeff<00:01:17.070> Green's<00:01:17.310> defense<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.390> he

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
Jeff Green's defense so I think he

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
Jeff Green's defense so I think he
matches<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.229> very<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.640> saw<00:01:20.820> down

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
matches up very well and as we saw down

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
matches up very well and as we saw down
in<00:01:21.240> Miami<00:01:21.869> earlier<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.380> season<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:23.100> are

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
in Miami earlier this season these are

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
in Miami earlier this season these are
the<00:01:23.340> games<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.670> Jeff<00:01:23.970> Green<00:01:24.180> loves<00:01:24.420> he<00:01:24.600> loves

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the games that Jeff Green loves he loves

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289 
the games that Jeff Green loves he loves

he's pretty decent in the post but I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.340 
he's pretty decent in the post but I
think<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.270> celtics<00:02:05.479> can<00:02:05.780> attack<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.200> basket

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
think the celtics can attack the basket

off<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.660> dribble<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.319> same<00:02:09.500> with<00:02:09.679> Gerald

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
off the dribble the same with Gerald

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.620 
off the dribble the same with Gerald
Wallace<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.459> I<00:02:10.819> think<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> celtics<00:02:11.330> can

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
Wallace and I think the celtics can

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.180 
Wallace and I think the celtics can
establish<00:02:11.900> jared<00:02:12.410> sullinger<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:12.980> post

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
establish jared sullinger and the post

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
establish jared sullinger and the post
cuz<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.880> know<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.120> next<00:02:14.270> don't<00:02:14.510> really<00:02:14.720> have

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
cuz you know the next don't really have

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.540 
cuz you know the next don't really have
a<00:02:14.900> tall<00:02:15.200> defender<00:02:15.350> down<00:02:15.770> there<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.160> i<00:02:16.190> think

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
a tall defender down there so i think

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.890 
a tall defender down there so i think
they<00:02:16.819> can<00:02:17.000> score<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.420> paint<00:02:17.630> that's<00:02:17.780> going

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
they can score in the paint that's going

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.540 
they can score in the paint that's going
to<00:02:17.959> be<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> critical<00:02:18.470> piece<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.920> game<00:02:19.130> okay

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
to be a critical piece of this game okay
