00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.089
 and well I'm going to start making a 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.889
 Spanish tortilla let's see how it 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.150
 It's very easy to do, I'm going to put 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.699
 a slice onion 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.670
 I'm going to cook it for a few 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.250
 minutes approximately 25 to 30 minutes 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.800
 with a spoonful of oil nothing more and 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.599
 the fire must be very short and in two 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.560
 cups of oil I will put to cook 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.580
 my parents 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.620
 to explode I will be very aware and 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.690
 I want to do it with you quickly to 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.760
 that breaks the boiling point and 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.710
 oil this oil if we are going to be able to 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.260
 occupy for anything else is 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.630
 olive oil and I can strain it and what 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.190
 I can enjoy something else here 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.330
 course I served today and I onion and 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.220
 they are ready 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.570
 my dads are also sewn not 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.460
 they are fried 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.790
 we are doing a cooking because I 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.050
 I would be breaking at the boiling point 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.860
 I want to see if you can see it is the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.540
 camera 4 there is already starting to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.350
 see beautiful they change you 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.350
 approach 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.910
 to the neighbors to the neighbors always 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.840
 lazio and still I know very well what I'm going to 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.900
 I'm going to lower it to a low flame 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.060
 softly softly because man so that 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 is the way they are going to sew 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.720
 potatoes ok well it will not break the point of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.390
 boiling again but it's going to be 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.400
 a work clearly and is ready you 're going to 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.240
 start to beat the eggs please 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.460
 but so he thinks there is no good now 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 we go more to add the potatoes that 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.950
 you have there 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.830
 previously you consider that you are facing 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.180
 of you something avoids marin exactly 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.180
 although very carefully 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:57.430
 many many many blue man and by the plate 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.430
 is saying 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.910
 let's put it does not help you burn the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.399
 onion previously also fried 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:12.260
 for 30 minutes and this is fine 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.820
 you are doing perfect and months that you 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.820
 parking is nothing silly 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.090
 Magic 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.940
 they did not do this to me to do a Spanish 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.890
 He has his joke lady 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.260
 I have a pan here, I'm going to put 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 enough olive oil is a frying pan 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.600
 that can enter the oven if you do not 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.460
 have you can see how the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.460
 Spanish ladies Spanish cuisine 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 how you look is a little technical 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.260
 complicated which I do not know 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.540
 I recommend if we are not an expert in 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.150
 cook when we and espanyol 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.640
 begins to be almost ready you start to 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.950
 cook in front of the center of the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.109
 sides and center forgiveness when almost 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.859
 they are not running the egg juices 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:05.430
 haha let's win a dish we're going to 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.930
 flip and then we're going to administer it 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.870
 again to the pan there is done 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.510
 really a Spanish omelet we 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.609
 to simplify life 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.760
 let's wait for nothing more than the sides and 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.220
 the center are very well cooked and the 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.889
 let's put the oven to a temperature 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.739
 mean too and it will be as if 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.099
 outside Spanish we see ourselves done this 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.989
 movement to remove it from the frying pan 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.250
 put it on a plate and since salt is the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.720
 joke of a Spanish tortilla but 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.879
