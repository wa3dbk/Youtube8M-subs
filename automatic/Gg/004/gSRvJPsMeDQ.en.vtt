00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.650
 Pineapple is one of the foods more 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.600
 known for their diuretic effects 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.940
 but sometimes it's hard to know if he's there or not 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.490
 mature for it we have to fix 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.770
 in the rhombuses the borders have to be 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.779
 yellow and the color inside 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.570
 the diamonds have to be yellow 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.990
 golden as candy color 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.109
 also if we press the base finger 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.869
 has to give in if we approach the 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.699
 nose has to have a pineapple smell 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.699
 but sweet very nice 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.380
 and clean a pineapple is easy first thing 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.070
 what we have to do is cut the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.070
 extremes 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.640
 here 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.080
 next we have to go peeling 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.940
 around trying to make the slices 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 so to speak a little thick for 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 try to eliminate these holes that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.590
 they get inside the meat and they do not 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.590
 can eat 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.530
 why 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.230
 then we clean well the remains that 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.230
 have been 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.910
 and also the little holes that you 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 commented, let's do this by putting the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.520
 knife diagonally and doing the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.090
 cuts being very careful 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.090
 Do not cut 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.110
 once we have the pineapple well cleaned 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.110
 what we do is slice it 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.359
 the center of the pineapple is very hard very 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.909
 Fibrous not eaten can be removed in a 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.540
 disheartening that is called pineapples or 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.540
 with the knife 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.770
 another way to cut the pineapple is in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.760
 paquitos for that we enter them well with 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.760
 the thickest base and cut it into 4 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.440
 then 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.810
 we have to take the heart of the part 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.900
 fibrous to each room we will do so with 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.650
 all the rooms and then we'll cut 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.650
 the ducklings 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.780
 and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.200
 and 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.300
 and
