00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 much has been said about the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.600
 damage that the antennas can cause 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.220
 of cellular telephony however you are 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.160
 companies have always shown arguments 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.349
 that deny any harm to the community 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.230
 but the lawyer are the morals of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.619
 montería is determined to deny this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 version I started this campaign because 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.080
 I currently reside in the Holy Quarter 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 lucia and I see that from the moment of the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.400
 position of one of these antennas I do not know 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.300
 if it will be from movistar's council I'm already 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.730
 in inquiry 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.180
 and the neighbors have been presenting 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.970
 ill health which led me to 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.800
 do series of investigations and take 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.290
 concepts of scientists at levels 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.470
 national and doctors at the national level 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.420
 where they pronounce of these radiations 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.640
 that produce these telephony antennas 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.559
 cellular for this reason and with a right 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.960
 of petition and this lawyer asks to be 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.600
 comply with the rules established in the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.589
 agreements with the municipal entity for that reason 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.809
 I took the time to elaborate a right 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.039
 of petition to the planning secretary 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.929
 municipal that is the person in charge of 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.539
 regulate this law 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.119
 I say law because I think that through 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.210
 of a municipal agreement that was made in 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.390
 2010 of the council of montería where 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.929
 they reform pop in their article 46 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.060
 paragraphs 1 and 4 emphasize that 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.580
 these cell phone antennas should 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.429
 be located 300 meters from the zones 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.260
 residential and 300 meters from the 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.570
 educational areas 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.390
 or that are not meeting the requirements 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.610
 and that's why raise this right of petition 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.070
 so that the municipal authorities or 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.020
 departmental organizations take measures in this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.240
 subject the right of petition also 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.100
 was sent to the control entities the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.290
 cell phone companies for their 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.290
 part has not been ruled on 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.730
 to this disagreement I did not get there 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.430
 I just presented the right to 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.960
 petition and they have a copy they have copies 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.970
 directed to them directed at the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.610
 municipal personality addressed to the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.610
 procuracy and the control entities
