latex I've been back into it lately so

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.640 
latex I've been back into it lately so
maybe<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.239> blood<00:03:29.630> elf<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.260> would<00:03:30.410> be<00:03:30.500> pretty

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
maybe a blood elf that would be pretty

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.729 
maybe a blood elf that would be pretty
cool<00:03:30.769> or<00:03:31.700> maybe<00:03:31.880> like<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> my<00:03:32.930> undead<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.380> have<00:03:33.650> an
