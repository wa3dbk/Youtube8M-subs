00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 years 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.290
 hello people here maxi in two years 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 alias bizarre cross and today we get 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.550
 found for a new tutorial not a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 tutorial at cros not at all but it will be a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.110
 tutorial shot our little ones 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.790
 rebounds and I will teach you how to kill 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.000
 enemies on the flags in 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.730
 domination in a rather pleasant way 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.250
 you will see that during the tutorial 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.019
 has a spa will kill twice turbulent 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.019
 bank on each side and a spot on 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.379
 these I would already like to thank coast cf 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.030
 for my ipod with the amap again and we 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.769
 let's start with a spot on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.809
 it's putting us in a little corner 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.420
 so that's when you lose it's you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.309
 you place like this you're going to have to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.339
 lift your tomahawk so that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.839
 the bottom article is in the middle of the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.970
 white band so do not hesitate to raise 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.780
 a little bit more the tomahawk for that 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.250
 it goes further 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.720
 we will see immediately the clip of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.400
 blizzard walk who gave it to us 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.100
 beautifully made two matches that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.869
 it's not a double and so I 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.880
 lets you admire what's going on with 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.869
 the bounce rate on the yellow roof then 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.510
 back to the ground 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.640
 we will immediately attacked the spot b 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.020
 so for the first spot on v you 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.790
 will you place between the two 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.960
 windows below the little cat and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.420
 you're just going right 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 relive the left eyebrow so the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.730
 man you will see everything from 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.040
 after 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.600
 and so that's your eyebrow 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.250
 left how much our backgrounds really 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.520
 exactly like that and you'll see that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.049
 will return beautifully with 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.759
 the little robot to have that all of 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.990
 Following'm here is I who carried ai 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.909
 so and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.430
 it goes well but you 'll see the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 second save even more nice of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.310
 really do it's a good start 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 the advantage that it really 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.340
 still go the enemies we'll see 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 not especially if we spy on sure it's 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.049
 so for the next you go you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.729
 block between the two pieces knows no 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 more what is called case you you 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.030
 block here and there it's going to be a whole 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.490
 little more complicated for only wrong 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.310
 but the result is really beautiful so 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.049
 in fact you will have to get up 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.640
 of the white band and be a little bit more 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.959
 to the left of the last black line at 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.459
 not if you see what I mean 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.019
 in any case put yourself as it is 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.430
 as I do now that you 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.930
 realize am here she is really beautiful 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.850
 antikabyle can hurt a lot 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.290
 you will see the route right away 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.569
 so he passes between them actually the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.459
 building and rock or doing a holding 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.610
 of smoke to enter the right eye 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.739
 the character is beautiful and we 're going 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.900
 attack on to you go hide yourself 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.460
 behind a tree 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.720
 Well here we do the dead 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.190
 what you want you want from 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.350
 recipes trees and you're going to have to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.370
 throw your thomas just to the left of 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.580
 the last run 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.750
 while not exceeding the building of 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.430
 life but again as success 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.960
 do not hesitate to raise your word for 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.360
 that they have a little further and for 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.120
 make a beautiful fall band 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.250
 this one was done by blizzard r and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.990
 here it ends the 2 ml match for 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.300
 teens who this time really failed 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.460
 to spend the days it becomes and this 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.470
 in any case I think it's 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.300
 besides the woman and so we 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.160
 confirm the proverb that says that 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.620
 sometimes it is better to hide that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 rock slider I hope these shots at 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 purpose we will have you more and you 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.290
 will succeed with regard to the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.550
 next map to reassure yourself stander 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.560
 I think it was planned on this 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.970
 map for tutors and cross does not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 really idea you can give me 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 in the comments ben I hope that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.530
 it will have pleased you so on this we get 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.450
 find for next videos hi 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.380
 to all these accident or bizarre themes 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.380
 Corsican who did not forget 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.330
 going 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.330
 the
