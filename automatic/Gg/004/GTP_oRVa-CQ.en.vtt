00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi welcome to culinary anarchy 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.919
 his long beard rarely be there 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.019
 to use products already prepared from 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.389
 groceries or genre so fashionable and 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.389
 prepare a croissant cake 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.990
 we already have a green growth framework 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.770
 here we do not note your talking about 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.369
 our board 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.900
 we will cut into nine pieces ego we do not 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.879
 will not run because I saw some 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.320
 not croissants but well and truly 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.269
 a cake with the pas because we're going 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 drop our pieces directly into 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.309
 our chips like this face 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.589
 per year to the need to grease note the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.030
 numbers because so big in 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.760
 his croissants him that will revive 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.000
 by cooking there is no chance that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.790
 it then sticks the mark for which 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.850
 we will pour 125 of cream 35% 1 6 to 25 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.739
 Millions of brown sugar mix stops 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 of a killer bros to get a handsome 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.520
 homogeneous mixture 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.869
 what I like most about ska is there 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.119
 it is well applied easy to achieve 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 it's sweet with the list of ingredients 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.150
 that we are sure that it will create 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 conversation made at coffee time on 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.440
 go to that everywhere on our door to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 believe all that remains to be done is 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.390
 to send it to the oven preheated to 350 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.100
 degrees fahrenheit for about 20 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 minutes or until the moment when the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 croissants gong is golden brown 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.690
 and here is a little dessert easy to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 realize that we can serve a nature 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.660
 with a fruit coulis or even a 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.270
 ice cream scoop 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.040
 sure thing we have to save with a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.040
 good east wind good appetite
