00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:05.440
 thank you start this great dream learning from the one that has already triumphed 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.100
 consider the Mexican band of the harriers their great masters and at the same time 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.570
 they receive full responsibility and they do it in the best way by touching 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.819
 the two bands together the eaglets and our angels of america 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 Daddy, we do not go with much sacrifice 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.950
 Mexican melodies that they played along the parade of the roses 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 they made the public 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.400
 and that is the commitment that they now have 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.610
 from america 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 to make the hearts of thousands of spectators vibrate 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.990

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.610

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 there are many here in the past year 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.010
 I say months the musical director of our angels of America 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.630
 is not as excited as any of the 220 members but more than 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 nothing 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.450
 delivered to the project to participate in the most viewed event in the entire world 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.479
 today here 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.250
 we the ticos 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.969
 we want missionaries 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.969
 who are we going to carry a banner a heart 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.929
 you have two 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.670
 d get to him he decides the roses and we as seconds 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.640
 to carry 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 that patota to the world sense in thesis here we are all united by the same 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.969
 heart 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.520
 and dressed in the same dress 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 and that to him here what many here will give him 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.550
 today with which people love them this year 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.360
 is the same with which our angels of America respond to the commitment of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.200
 maintain strong union ties between all Latin countries this 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200
 continent 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.509
 the instruments may be different 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.669
 the uniforms maybe also 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.669
 but the delivery of the boys 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.759
 in our American continent 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.139
 in this way it is established that for music there are no borders and when 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.929
 try our music 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:10.469
 the geographical lines completely disappear this year the band was 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.739
 The next one is the Costa Rica one, but both of them brandish the same flag. 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.739
 Latin American flag that unites all our countries and that makes us feel 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.829
 the same pride
