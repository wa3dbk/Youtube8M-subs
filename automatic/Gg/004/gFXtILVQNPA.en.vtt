00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.569
 and dracula movie style evenings 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.129
 is under the control of the will but 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.840
 that many times if the person entered 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.280
 in a hypnotic state and left 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.620
 totally alone the person who makes 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.420
 a common physiological sleep happens and 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.310
 current and wake up as I woke up from 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.490
 any dream Mr. ramón your question 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:26.529
 and then Mrs. Smith Mr. Rolon 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 good morning, greetings to all 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 friends of junks friends 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.790
 but we want to know what time put in 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.180
 a human being of an older person 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:50.500
 sleep because we have friends 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:52.989
 that there is a day two hours two hours and 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.190
 they go back to work again and what time 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.230
 is a human being to recover that or 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.550
 be the scientific evidence what 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.100
 indica is that there are some differences 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.020
 tremendous individual there is not a rule 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.300
 particular that can be used and said 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.720
 you need a minimum of seven hours 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.810
 of sleep 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.460
 that is not is not a reality of agreement 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.170
 to the investigations there are differences 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.970
 individual and the key does not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.979
 necessarily are the hours of sleep 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.289
 but the kind of problem that you have 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.259
 the other day of not being able to work 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.030
 it can be measured is not like eight hours and 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.619
 science all those hair plunges 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.530
 Myths are not measured if you sleep 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.310
 five hours and doing well is good for 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.350
 you and it is normal 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 other people return more others 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.369
 least we have a question you have 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.320
 a young question as well as not good 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.740
 laia and happy new year to all 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.190
 I am also from the village of reeds this 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.100
 I wanted to say that I suffer from it 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.619
 bad and I wake up in a total way 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.570
 sometimes most of the time sometimes 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.840
 sometimes for no reason that when I have 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.869
 reasons may more and more conducive to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.090
 I have taken this several 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.140
 sleeping pills but in none do they make me 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.530
 nothing except one that of natural action 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 I wanted to ask the psychiatrist if 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.709
 by chance there is a method for 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.000
 one can learn to sleep without having 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.140
 what to use sleeping pills 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.180
 or my mother's pill is that of the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.000
 mind although it actually works to 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.710
 times and others do not count angels but 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.490
 First you have to see the crimes because 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.740
 yes 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.020
 but one tells them when the beckham 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.610
 it lasts 12 months and with that I told you and the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.200
 sheep have to see them in their 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 imagination but also some 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.940
 people count sheep gives you result 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.420
 dr 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.270
 well, there it is, well, classic 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.460
 these methodologies to be able to sleep that 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.050
 I think that helps us count 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.060
 little sheep I could more difficult to follow 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.640
 up to count the horn 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.630
 wheel 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.450
 I return at the beginning the same thing for itself 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.910
 if there is an environmental circumstance that 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.410
 it prevents you from doing that, it's natural that 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.560
 there is place in a state of tension 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.440
 of anxiety you will not sleep because the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.440
 brain activity is still there to everything to 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.900
 all steam and does not allow us the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.050
 relaxation needed to start the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.420
 sleep process now if it does not obey 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.380
 no external cause and it is insomnia 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.510
 persist and permanent you have to find out 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.250
 the cause of that situation is a lady 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.660
 Mrs. vélez destroyed high that has a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.540
 recipe for insomnia 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.630
 Young Carmen if she can not sleep mix 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.400
 soda crackers with pineapple juice or if 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.830
 not if you do not like that 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.390
 Mix ginger with milk and well 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.460
 hot 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.410
 thank you very much I will not treat cause 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.530
 and we resume the discussion after the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.530
 messages 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.560
 I have many recommendations to sleep 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.690
 the riverside lady says it's important 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.350
 take into account the diet in insomnia 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.450
 you should take old remedies do not take 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.400
 pills in some cases we can not 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.840
 be so drastic lady Gonzalez of 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.540
 trujillo alto took off the insomnia 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.470
 eating lettuce from the country 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.660
 that's true I suffered insomnia from 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.610
 concerns he solved it 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.229
 I raised I wrote on paper the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.620
 concerns and then he turned to 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.810
 sleep 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.240
 gorgeous paper boots 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.860
 that you can recommend for babies 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.230
 months suffering from insomnia for 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.970
 nothing television take it to the pediatrician and 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.860
 that the pediatrician evaluates it 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.380
 fernandez sanjuán his question that already the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.060
 time he betrayed us he asks me well 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.700
 I want to know if the dream is 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.090
 if one gets after sleeping is no 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.180
 an internal position and I recover the dream 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.550
 what I lost if I stay the same doctor 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.830
 process that recovers the dream 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.810
 We can say yes and qualifying 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.060
 depending on the type of sleep that is already 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.110
 of private if the person is deprived of 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.090
 king there is a tendency to reproduce more 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.400
 amount of that dream be bounce or 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.169
 be that if you dream more of the next 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.620
 question why because when you go in a 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.510
 tram in a bus in a car in 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.919
 end do not sleep well one of the 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.630
 reasons may be that as we had 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.639
 said out of the air that is the movement 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.100
 rhythmic and monotony in the 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.930
 auto that can give the place to 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.990
 recommend that you can often 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.669
 use music that is classical music 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.740
 which is where there are no words that is 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.020
 more instrumental mostly music 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.750
 baroque period especially the long ones 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.280
 the sound of a droplet falling at 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.870
 better helps him sleep to me that 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.629
 help and if not the sound of the sea 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.550
 psychiatrist the best island sleeps but no 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.310
 he wants to live so he recommends them 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.759
 quickie the lady diaz of your high good 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.770
 sometimes there is a rejection of 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.020
 medication why take it but not 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.690
 it is necessarily nothing bad says also 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.400
 that for you the lady lÃ³pez of receipt 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.470
 sometimes without having started the consultation 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.470
 the doctor no longer dispenses prescribing 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.569
 bad pills made by the doctor you 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.979
 because he can not sleep sometimes not 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.840
 so we should tell him now what 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.330
 next the association of pensioners 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.669
 who skillfully don Manuel de la Rosa 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.530
 the big concern now is that the 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.509
 pensioners can not sleep since 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.150
 they are listening late to the press the 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:25.060
 of current actuarial cissé and thinking of 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.159
 know 2004 there will be no money to 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.750
 pay the pensioners what is the 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.490
 big problem why can not sleep 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.440
 and this is the problem of the association 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.020
 when, because of a government, it can not 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.930
 sleep is a classic remedy you would 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.729
 tomorrow vote against pollution 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.350
 our every day in 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.720
 controversial that you 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.770
 It's full of sun, but last night I 've 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.770
 unveiled this morning 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.990
