00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
like it but I had some time to think

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
like it but I had some time to think
about<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> plan<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.000> look<00:00:39.120> around<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.140> if

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
about and plan and look around to see if

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410 
about and plan and look around to see if
I<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.770> build<00:00:40.950> something<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.550> powerful<00:00:41.969> or

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420

more<00:00:42.450> powerful<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> same<00:00:43.620> amount<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
more powerful for the same amount of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
more powerful for the same amount of
money<00:00:44.129> while<00:00:44.730> still<00:00:45.059> being<00:00:45.210> portable<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
money while still being portable first I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.130 
money while still being portable first I
didn't<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.710> could<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.510> then<00:00:48.510> later<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
didn't think I could do it then later I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.529 
didn't think I could do it then later I
realized<00:00:49.680> after<00:00:49.980> having<00:00:50.520> time<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> wait<00:00:51.149> for

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
realized after having time to wait for

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.850 
gonna be doing a 4k editing so it's
going<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.510> super<00:03:02.810> important<00:03:03.260> if<00:03:03.650> you're

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
going to be super important if you're
