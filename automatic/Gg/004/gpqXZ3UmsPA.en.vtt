00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
SWAT man can I smile from here to here

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.930 
SWAT man can I smile from here to here
so<00:00:31.410> presumably<00:00:31.950> that<00:00:32.129> means<00:00:32.279> perfectly<00:00:32.910> I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so presumably that means perfectly I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
so presumably that means perfectly I
elation<00:00:33.449> yeah<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.980> he's<00:00:35.129> working<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
elation yeah so he's working on the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640 
elation yeah so he's working on the
premise<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.150> if<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> test<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.989> saw<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.350> twelve

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
premise of if the test we saw was twelve

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.740 
premise of if the test we saw was twelve
rounds<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.190> getting<00:00:38.430> 50<00:00:38.879> rounds<00:00:39.239> per<00:00:39.480> cup

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
rounds you're getting 50 rounds per cup

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
rounds you're getting 50 rounds per cup
if<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.410> 20<00:00:40.769> people<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.309> ground<00:00:41.550> 20

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
if I have 20 people on the ground 20

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
if I have 20 people on the ground 20
cops<00:00:42.150> on<00:00:42.390> ground<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.650> three<00:00:43.890> six

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
cops on ground I think I like three six

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
cops on ground I think I like three six
cars<00:00:45.440> say<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.620> supercar<00:00:47.370> plus<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.750> eight

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
cars say we supercar plus you know eight

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.079 
cars say we supercar plus you know eight
other<00:00:49.230> people<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.339> this<00:00:50.489> demonstrates

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
other people so really this demonstrates

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.869 
other people so really this demonstrates
to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> director<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.530> portion<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to the director the portion of this

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.689 
to the director the portion of this
scenario<00:00:54.269> that's<00:00:54.479> a<00:00:54.629> set<00:00:54.869> and<00:00:55.519> portion<00:00:56.519> that's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
scenario that's a set and portion that's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.240 
scenario that's a set and portion that's
a<00:00:56.820> real<00:00:58.460> location<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:01.250> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a real location this is actually the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.899 
a real location this is actually the
building<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> under<00:01:04.080> siege<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.589> now

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
building that is under siege right now

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.250 
building that is under siege right now
we<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.060> shoot<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> exterior<00:01:06.990> elements

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
we will shoot the exterior elements

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
we will shoot the exterior elements
which<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> road<00:01:08.939> arts<00:01:09.420> or

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
which are really from the road arts or

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.539 
which are really from the road arts or
the<00:01:09.600> front<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> building<00:01:10.369> all<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the front of the building all on

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.850 
the front of the building all on
location<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> block<00:01:13.290> away<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.710> have

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
location about a block away we have

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.670 
location about a block away we have
residential<00:01:14.460> areas<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.210> can't<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.720> blowing

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
residential areas so we can't go blowing

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
residential areas so we can't go blowing
things<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.720> sort<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> middle<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
things up sort of in the middle of the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
things up sort of in the middle of the
night<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.189> we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
night which is what we're going to do we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.930 
night which is what we're going to do we
couldn't<00:01:21.000> find<00:01:21.240> any<00:01:21.619> explosions<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.979> charges

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
couldn't find any explosions or charges

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.320 
couldn't find any explosions or charges
big<00:01:24.150> enough<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.390> Brian's<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> went<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
big enough for Brian's so I went to the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.460 
big enough for Brian's so I went to the
Australian<00:01:27.330> military

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Australian military

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.880 
Australian military
and<00:01:28.560> we've<00:01:29.370> actually<00:01:29.490> gotten<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.150> military

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
and we've actually gotten a military

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.460 
and we've actually gotten a military
yeah<00:01:31.890> yeah<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:33.120> name<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.360> Chris<00:01:33.540> Marion<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
yeah yeah my name is Chris Marion and I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.250 
yeah yeah my name is Chris Marion and I
was<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.830> pyro<00:01:35.130> bus<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.940> this<00:01:36.780> sequence

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
was the pyro bus for this this sequence

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.940 
was the pyro bus for this this sequence
a<00:01:38.420> team<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> about<00:01:39.690> six<00:01:40.080> or<00:01:40.230> seven<00:01:40.470> people<00:01:40.620> who

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
a team of about six or seven people who

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
a team of about six or seven people who
will<00:01:41.490> work<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.030> hard<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:42.600> well

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
will work very very hard and very well

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.830 
will work very very hard and very well
we<00:01:43.590> use<00:01:43.770> new<00:01:44.070> technology<00:01:44.760> on<00:01:44.910> this<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
we use new technology on this on this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.110 
we use new technology on this on this
sequence<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.710> programmable<00:01:47.550> detonators

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
sequence we as programmable detonators

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.420 
sequence we as programmable detonators
which<00:01:48.960> means<00:01:49.530> each<00:01:49.710> detonator<00:01:50.190> has<00:01:50.370> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
which means each detonator has a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490 
which means each detonator has a
identity<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.480> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.750> assign<00:01:51.990> at<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.260> time

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
identity and you can assign at this time

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
identity and you can assign at this time
or<00:01:53.280> intrinsically<00:01:53.820> safe<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.420> hasn't<00:01:54.720> been

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
or intrinsically safe it hasn't been

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
or intrinsically safe it hasn't been
done<00:01:55.020> before<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.250> worked<00:01:56.460> pretty<00:01:56.520> well

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
done before and it's worked pretty well

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.090 
done before and it's worked pretty well
and<00:01:57.570> we're<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.900> very<00:01:57.960> happy<00:01:58.260> which<00:01:58.800> cars

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and we're really very happy which cars

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.230 
and we're really very happy which cars
gonna<00:01:59.310> blow<00:01:59.460> up<00:02:04.550> yeah<00:02:05.550> why<00:02:05.760> not

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
gonna blow up yeah why not

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.750 
gonna blow up yeah why not
it's<00:02:06.660> gonna<00:02:06.870> be<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> very<00:02:07.200> very<00:02:07.920> highly<00:02:08.220> charged

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
it's gonna be a very very highly charged

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.510 
it's gonna be a very very highly charged
evening<00:02:09.230> and<00:02:10.230> I'm<00:02:10.470> looking<00:02:10.710> forward<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.010> it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.610 

we<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.570> do<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> little<00:02:18.930> bit<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.080> car<00:02:19.350> work

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
we have to do a little bit of car work

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.290 
we have to do a little bit of car work
here<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> got<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> Aussie<00:02:20.550> boy<00:02:20.700> sliding<00:02:21.210> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
here I got the Aussie boy sliding the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.700 
here I got the Aussie boy sliding the
cars<00:02:21.510> into<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> stop<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.230> front<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> bank
