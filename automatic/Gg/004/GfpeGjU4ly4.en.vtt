these<00:03:02.439> over<00:03:02.680> here<00:03:02.859> probably<00:03:03.579> just<00:03:03.909> make

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
these over here probably just make

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.920 
these over here probably just make
really<00:03:04.629> design<00:03:05.049> down<00:03:05.319> there<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:07.120> evil<00:03:07.720> lines

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
really design down there the evil lines

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.530 
really design down there the evil lines
on<00:03:08.109> this<00:03:08.260> or<00:03:08.440> gold<00:03:08.650> other<00:03:09.129> than<00:03:09.250> NZ<00:03:09.670> Sam<00:03:10.329> I'm
