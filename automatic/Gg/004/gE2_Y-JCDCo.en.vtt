in<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> thought<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> long<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
in here and I thought about it long and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
in here and I thought about it long and
hard<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.640> then<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.850> decided<00:01:00.180> against<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
hard but then I decided against it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
hard but then I decided against it
because<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.050> thought<00:01:01.199> had<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.070> what

windmill this is the windmill and a
water<00:02:38.340> wheel<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> thought<00:02:39.359> that'd<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:39.659> cool

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810

are the two older builds that we're
going<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.099> have<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.489> think<00:03:17.790> from<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:17.940> on

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
going to have but I think from now on

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000 
going to have but I think from now on
I'm<00:03:18.359> going<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.599> do<00:03:18.690> newer<00:03:19.019> builds<00:03:19.500> newer<00:03:19.739> style

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
I'm going to do newer builds newer style

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.379 
I'm going to do newer builds newer style
bills<00:03:20.220> because<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.609> kind<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.819> looks<00:03:20.970> yield

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
bills because this kind of looks yield

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.240

and<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.079> kind<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.379> looks<00:03:22.500> yield<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.129> I<00:03:23.160> think

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
and this kind of looks yield so I think

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.619 
and this kind of looks yield so I think
I'm<00:03:23.430> gonna<00:03:23.489> stay<00:03:23.730> away<00:03:23.879> from<00:03:23.940> he<00:03:24.239> old<00:03:24.389> them
