for<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.150> few<00:01:37.420> different<00:01:37.540> reasons<00:01:37.780> first<00:01:38.710> off<00:01:38.950> of

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
for a few different reasons first off of

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.820 
for a few different reasons first off of
course<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.610> has<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.760> built<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.690> or<00:01:40.990> built<00:01:41.530> on

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
course it has a built in or built on

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.950 
course it has a built in or built on
video<00:01:42.400> camera<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.330> will<00:01:43.600> allow<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.810> to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
video camera this will allow you to

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.280 
video camera this will allow you to
record<00:01:44.140> I'd<00:01:44.560> say<00:01:44.770> it's<00:01:44.920> between<00:01:45.130> 480<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.479> 720

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
record I'd say it's between 480 and 720

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.780 
record I'd say it's between 480 and 720
they<00:01:47.680> don't<00:01:47.860> really<00:01:48.040> have<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> specs<00:01:48.610> for

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
they don't really have the specs for

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.700 
they don't really have the specs for
that<00:01:49.000> but<00:01:49.210> I'll<00:01:49.659> show<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.080> video<00:01:50.350> here<00:01:50.680> and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
that but I'll show the video here and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.830 
that but I'll show the video here and
you<00:01:51.040> can<00:01:51.190> just<00:01:51.369> kind<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:51.940> guess<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.450> yourself

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
you can just kind of guess for yourself

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.380 
you can just kind of guess for yourself
this<00:01:53.350> will<00:01:53.530> take<00:01:53.710> both<00:01:53.950> video<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.729> pictures

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
this will take both video and pictures

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.060 
this will take both video and pictures
now<00:01:55.660> for<00:01:55.869> pictures<00:01:56.290> if<00:01:56.680> you're<00:01:56.800> gonna<00:01:56.890> be

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
now for pictures if you're gonna be

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.530 
now for pictures if you're gonna be
taking<00:01:57.369> pictures<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.030> you'll<00:01:58.270> kind<00:01:58.450> of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
taking pictures with this you'll kind of

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.480 
taking pictures with this you'll kind of
want<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.810> be<00:01:58.930> hovering<00:01:59.170> in<00:01:59.530> one<00:01:59.710> spot<00:02:00.040> because

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
want to be hovering in one spot because

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.680 
want to be hovering in one spot because
if<00:02:00.700> you're<00:02:00.820> flying<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.270> through<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.540> air

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
if you're flying this through the air

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.390 
if you're flying this through the air
and<00:02:01.869> just<00:02:01.990> firing<00:02:02.259> off<00:02:02.440> pictures<00:02:02.950> they're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
and just firing off pictures they're

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.450 
and just firing off pictures they're
probably<00:02:03.610> gonna<00:02:03.790> come<00:02:03.970> out<00:02:04.119> pretty<00:02:04.150> blurry

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
probably gonna come out pretty blurry

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.070 
probably gonna come out pretty blurry
not<00:02:06.460> only<00:02:06.640> does<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.940> camera<00:02:07.240> record<00:02:07.630> video

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
not only does the camera record video

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.740 
not only does the camera record video
and<00:02:08.410> pictures<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:08.950> also<00:02:09.640> record<00:02:10.149> sound<00:02:10.539> if

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
and pictures that also record sound if

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.479 
and pictures that also record sound if
you're<00:02:10.869> doing<00:02:11.110> video<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.010> that's<00:02:12.100> kind<00:02:12.370> of

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
you're doing video so that's kind of

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.490 
you're doing video so that's kind of
nice<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.209> have<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> option<00:02:13.630> all<00:02:14.320> you're

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
nice that you have the option all you're

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.110 
nice that you have the option all you're
gonna<00:02:14.620> hear<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> bunch<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.370> swarming<00:02:15.880> bees

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
gonna hear is a bunch of swarming bees

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.970 
gonna hear is a bunch of swarming bees
but<00:02:16.510> at<00:02:16.600> least<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.900> got<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.260> option<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.739> use

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
but at least you got that option to use

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.400 
but at least you got that option to use
the<00:02:18.190> sound<00:02:18.489> maybe<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> cool<00:02:19.810> crash

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.560 
the sound maybe if you have a cool crash
or<00:02:20.769> something<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.330> need<00:02:22.540> that

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.630 
or something and you just need that
sound<00:02:22.989> now<00:02:23.709> like<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.920> said<00:02:23.980> flight<00:02:24.310> time<00:02:24.489> for

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
sound now like I said flight time for

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.310 
sound now like I said flight time for
this<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.880> about<00:02:25.120> seven<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.600> nine<00:02:25.750> minutes<00:02:25.780> just

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
this is about seven to nine minutes just

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.620 
this is about seven to nine minutes just
depending<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:26.920> how<00:02:27.519> hard<00:02:27.760> you're<00:02:28.000> flying<00:02:28.300> if

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
depending on how hard you're flying if

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.090 
depending on how hard you're flying if
you're<00:02:28.840> doing<00:02:29.080> flips<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> things<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:30.040> that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
you're doing flips and things like that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.759 
you're doing flips and things like that
so<00:02:30.580> get<00:02:31.030> between<00:02:31.239> 7<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.690> 9<00:02:31.930> minutes<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.739> for

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
so get between 7 to 9 minutes now for

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.040 
so get between 7 to 9 minutes now for
charging<00:02:33.489> time<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.940> actual<00:02:34.300> battery<00:02:34.690> itself

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
charging time with actual battery itself

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.520 
charging time with actual battery itself
is<00:02:35.290> about<00:02:35.410> 40<00:02:35.890> minutes<00:02:36.220> now<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.970> m60<00:02:37.540> ar+<00:02:38.110> does

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
is about 40 minutes now the m60 ar+ does

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.670 
is about 40 minutes now the m60 ar+ does
have<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> range<00:02:39.100> between<00:02:39.400> 30<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.239> 50<00:02:40.989> meters<00:02:41.470> as

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
have a range between 30 and 50 meters as

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.789 
have a range between 30 and 50 meters as
between<00:02:42.220> 98<00:02:42.820> feet<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.299> 164<00:02:44.260> feet<00:02:44.320> which<00:02:44.769> is

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
between 98 feet and 164 feet which is

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.039 
between 98 feet and 164 feet which is
quite<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> ways<00:02:45.579> up<00:02:45.790> there<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> sky<00:02:46.660> and

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
quite a ways up there in the sky and

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.289 
quite a ways up there in the sky and
since<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.709> white<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.280> know<00:02:48.640> kind<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.000> blend

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
since it's white you know kind of blend

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.880 
since it's white you know kind of blend
in<00:02:49.480> with<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.750> clouds<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.290> stuff<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> think

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
in with the clouds and stuff so I think

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.580 
in with the clouds and stuff so I think
that's<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.190> good<00:02:51.400> height<00:02:51.700> for<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:52.150> quadcopter

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.010 

now<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.520> two<00:03:00.730> different<00:03:00.760> modes<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.660> here

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
now you have two different modes on here

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.790 
now you have two different modes on here
we<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.380> high<00:03:03.190> rate<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.910> low<00:03:04.150> rate

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
we have a high rate and a low rate

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.660 
we have a high rate and a low rate
alright<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:05.980> we'll<00:03:06.069> just<00:03:06.190> go<00:03:06.340> through<00:03:06.550> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
alright so we'll just go through the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.850 
alright so we'll just go through the
modes<00:03:06.880> real<00:03:07.209> quick<00:03:07.480> we<00:03:07.690> got<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.050> in<00:03:08.170> low<00:03:08.500> right

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
modes real quick we got it in low right

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:19.949 
modes real quick we got it in low right
now<00:03:08.890> go<00:03:09.489> ahead<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.790> switch<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.270> high<00:03:18.959> go

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
now go ahead and switch it to high go

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.330 
now go ahead and switch it to high go
ahead<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.230> go<00:03:20.319> back<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.680> forth<00:03:20.860> here<00:03:21.190> real

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
ahead and go back and forth here real

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.440 
ahead and go back and forth here real
quick<00:03:21.550> for<00:03:21.790> you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.760 

let's<00:03:31.450> go<00:03:31.570> ahead<00:03:31.660> put<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.350> back<00:03:32.500> into<00:03:32.830> low

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:48.090 

and<00:03:39.770> see<00:03:40.010> it's<00:03:41.230> much<00:03:42.230> slower<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.750> very<00:03:45.080> stable

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.800 

now<00:03:49.100> besides<00:03:49.459> those<00:03:49.640> two<00:03:49.700> different<00:03:50.180> modes<00:03:50.360> we

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
now besides those two different modes we

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.770 
now besides those two different modes we
also<00:03:51.110> have<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.770> headless<00:03:52.490> mode<00:03:52.760> headless<00:03:53.510> mode

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
also have a headless mode headless mode

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.600 
also have a headless mode headless mode
is<00:03:54.020> absolutely<00:03:54.590> awesome<00:03:54.830> especially<00:03:55.520> if

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
is absolutely awesome especially if

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.150 
is absolutely awesome especially if
you're<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.760> beginner<00:03:55.910> or<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:57.260> just<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:58.010> know

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
you're a beginner or you just you know

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.910 
you're a beginner or you just you know
you<00:03:58.459> want<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.760> safe<00:03:59.090> way<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:00.020> flying<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.890> can

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
you want a safe way of flying you can

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.640 
you want a safe way of flying you can
put<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.459> into<00:04:01.840> headless<00:04:02.840> mode<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.350> no

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
put this into headless mode and no

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.770 
put this into headless mode and no
matter<00:04:03.890> which<00:04:04.280> way<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.910> quadcopter<00:04:05.180> is

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
matter which way the quadcopter is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.710 
matter which way the quadcopter is
pointing<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:07.130> will<00:04:07.310> always<00:04:07.580> go<00:04:08.150> in<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> way

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
pointing it will always go in the way

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.390 
pointing it will always go in the way
that<00:04:08.930> you're<00:04:09.050> steering<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.680> which<00:04:09.860> is<00:04:10.069> really

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
that you're steering it which is really

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.420 
that you're steering it which is really
really<00:04:11.209> nice<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:12.680> put<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.100> headless

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
really nice to put it in the headless

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.979 
really nice to put it in the headless
mode<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:14.030> just<00:04:14.180> need<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.420> push<00:04:14.630> this<00:04:14.750> button

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
mode you just need to push this button

here push it inward and these lights
will<00:04:18.169> start<00:04:18.410> flashing

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
will start flashing

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.550 
will start flashing
I'll<00:04:19.130> show<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:20.049> let's<00:04:21.049> see<00:04:21.169> how<00:04:21.230> their<00:04:21.410> kind

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
I'll show you let's see how their kind

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.130 
I'll show you let's see how their kind

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
of flash like that now so now we'll just

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.230 
of flash like that now so now we'll just
go<00:04:24.440> ahead<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.890> toss<00:04:25.100> her<00:04:25.310> up<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:29.090> can

go ahead and toss her up and now you can

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.540 
go ahead and toss her up and now you can
see<00:04:30.070> whichever<00:04:31.070> way<00:04:32.230> I'm<00:04:33.230> pointing<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.890> let<00:04:34.400> me

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
and when I fly it this way it's still

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.490 
and when I fly it this way it's still
gonna<00:04:42.770> fly<00:04:42.979> this<00:04:43.040> way<00:04:43.660> which<00:04:44.660> is<00:04:44.870> really<00:04:45.260> great

this by pushing the left trigger and

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.830 
this by pushing the left trigger and
then<00:05:07.490> just<00:05:07.729> pushing<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.180> direction<00:05:08.600> if<00:05:08.690> you'd

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
then just pushing the direction if you'd

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.300 
then just pushing the direction if you'd
like<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.320> flip<00:05:09.560> you<00:05:09.800> can<00:05:09.950> flip<00:05:10.190> it

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
like it to flip you can flip it

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.060 
like it to flip you can flip it
frontwards<00:05:10.820> backwards<00:05:11.440> left-right<00:05:12.440> angle

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
frontwards backwards left-right angle

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.490 
frontwards backwards left-right angle
that<00:05:13.250> doesn't<00:05:13.580> matter<00:05:13.729> and<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.450> recovery<00:05:15.290> on

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
that doesn't matter and the recovery on

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.500 
that doesn't matter and the recovery on
this<00:05:15.740> thing<00:05:15.979> is<00:05:16.160> amazing<00:05:16.850> it<00:05:17.030> looks<00:05:17.270> like<00:05:17.479> a

really good now to take video on this on

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.200 
really good now to take video on this on
the<00:05:27.919> transmitter<00:05:28.460> you'll<00:05:28.760> need<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:29.000> go<00:05:29.150> to

the transmitter you'll need to go to

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.730 
the transmitter you'll need to go to
this<00:05:29.419> button<00:05:29.720> right<00:05:29.930> here<00:05:29.960> and<00:05:30.169> push<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.710> down
