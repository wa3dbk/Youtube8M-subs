 this scholarship 3 career status 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.840
 is that if it's a little difficult guys 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.319
 fact of not being and not having to then 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.340

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.630
 pitch and the conversions no longer play 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.820

 one Tuesday and the other Saturday 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.470
 more or less yes on Tuesday to the sea thought 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.810
 so you have a preserve so that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.760
 He has quoted from the time they vote 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.410
 well for the next challenge and good me 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.850
 I told them that if he wins he already killed if 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.760
 how a winner is uncertain and I think that 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.130
 enough is enough I do not feel good but 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.700
