00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.960
 Heyer / Germany open I've bought something and a protective film 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.099
 and for my iPod Touch 3g 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.789
 a so-called just in front of her 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.340
 which plays when the iPod outsiders Andersson come to us 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.560
 Files for the slightly darker become stress plans 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.140
 and then what indeed contained in these 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 Package can not say to blow 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.360
 Slide land is 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.520
 and a little towel to clean the display 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.460
 you really did that too 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.570
 two locations are distributed by the AMS 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.680
 the film and so it's still this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360
 Rainer extra movie bad 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.760
 Waltersdorf is similarly sad here 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 and also Chinese 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.260
 well there it is 5 EB chips tv enjoyment cdu-woman radiation is missing no 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.580
 I understand, of course, I'm brief about wearing no matter shaking 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.580
 Cancel shock and that's what counts Â» 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930
 tastier is not just on my iPod 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 so the whole thing is now on Issing took but of Shake one sees so 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.260
 The iPod percent of total reflects 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.820
 in fact, it has been earlier 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.920
 put the two 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 Ashcroft 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 the distribution channel mode and then played like that 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.660
 hiking on power 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.300
 Of course he does it if the cameras are not so low 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.020
 I did not reflect anything 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140
 get 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.350
 yes it is a bit darker but you can still 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.620
 to give the settings 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.070
 brightness 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.030
 and the glory 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.650
 to perform a bit 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.040
 i would be kids 12 yet 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.400
 under 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.530
 Spit Euro and Sales 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 the whole fun I had cost about ten euros at that time already 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.480
 but it was well worth it 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.700
 Manske Mortgage Day, too, you just always get Kamil Stoch on Austrian 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 ground 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 I thought so 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.779
 This time, thanks to her, many thanks for watching the war 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.969
 writes but also complains the delete trains has fallen and by 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.040
 Elimination of neighbors 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.779
 Of course not on the 9th 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.779
 80 percent yes around and 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.409
 That's it 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.110
 the urge
