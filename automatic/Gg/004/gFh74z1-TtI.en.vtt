00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello dear friends savannah and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.020
 marakasi you are watching a new rubric 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.540
 best tanks in nomination 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.730
 that is, I will show you those tanks 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.250
 who are the best in some area 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.760
 for example, booking accuracy 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 implements and so on nominations can be 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.359
 completely different and in 1 nomination for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 armor on the tenth level wins us 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 Fri-Sau T110 E3 So why do I think 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 This Fri-Sau is the best in booking among 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.750
 all cars of level 10 because e3 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 no serious vulnerabilities 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.910
 wherever opponents could easily punch 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.920
 There are of course weak points but there 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 not all punch and not always 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 for example, this is of course nld where most often 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.800
 and shoot opponents but he is pretty 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.649
 strong about e3 and even pt 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.199
 Sometimes they do not get there, especially if 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.899
 you can also wrap this monster 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.359
 punch in the tub but before that player on e3 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.180
 must return the enclosures and show you them 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.630
 but it happens very rarely mostly 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.080
 because of inexperience well this is if you went to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 rear 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 but the last weak point is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.520
 Of course that's the roof of the tower's 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 small pens do not confuse them with a huge 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.830
 commander's tower here it is his bump 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.220
 so-called and pierce her extremely 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.350
 hard by the way but you can punch the roof 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 but for this your tank must be either 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.320
 above 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.380
 or he himself must be high in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 The whole t110 e3 has incredible 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 strong forehead with which 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.720
 you can really drill thousands 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.380
 impenetrable damage from any opponent 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.430
 cutting and Vld allows generally creates 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.060
 miracles sometimes and drag fight I think that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.729
 e3 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 very interesting car but pumping up 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.360
 she is extremely difficult in the nomination best 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.030
 firepower beats waffentrager e100 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.110
 no other car in the game is capable 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.080
 inflict 3360 damage in 10 seconds 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.930
 no adversary will survive after this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.299
 this is a huge damage 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.540
 and I think waffles are the most dangerous 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.530
 PT-ACS in the game but at the same time the most 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 vulnerable 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.930
 and cardboard as you probably know 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.120
 waffentur e100 ponerfili like many 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.269
 Other Fri-Sau level 10 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.639
 but still this unit is oppressive and 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.280
 distribute everything in its path causes 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:37.609
 incredible damage to enemies and beats all 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.840
 records and this helps him accurate 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.879
 penetrating powerful gun which 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.439
 really does so much damage that 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.169
 no other tank 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.329
 it never dreamed but true as you 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:53.720
 surely know waffles all focus 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.060
 because she's cardboard huge everything 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.480
 want free homework and understand that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.329
 This is a very dangerous car . 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.159
 the wafer's tools are still cheaters up 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.169
 after nerf certainly became worse 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.510
 stabilization is now just not 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.549
 it will turn on the enemy immediately 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.650
 shoot and one hundred percent get there 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.959
 now have to come down a little there 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.879
 a half seconds plus everything is 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.030
 scatter 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:23.629
 029 is perfect accuracy and everything 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.970
 else there is an excellent break through 276 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.169
 and if this is not enough for you 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.650
 breaking through 352 gold in general 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:36.199
 characteristics are valid and so on 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.519
 nomination the fastest compact tank 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.319
 10 level battles won 25 tons as 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.840
 you probably know in our game 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.019
 small tanks have clear advantages 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.199
 they have the best masking them easier 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.419
 hide because the size is smaller and 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:56.150
 certainly more difficult for them to get a 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.729
 good speed gives generally great 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.009
 amount of benefits first you 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.949
 can take faster interesting positions 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:06.019
 you can catch there capture also 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.239
 speed allows you to spin slow 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.060
 opponents or just dodge 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.579
 shots and on this course plus this 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.859
 the Frenchman does not end well with him 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.919
 there are powerful tools with a loading drum 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.409
 on 5 shells and it allows him 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.520
 worn on the map 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.310
 shoot enemies 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.190
 shine even at the cost of his disguise and 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.620
 small in size and that's very all 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.379
 interesting and fun so i love 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.990
 bochata definitely play bass tello 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.090
 not very exciting and in many ways it 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.150
 because he has a great maximum 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.500
 speed of 65 kilometers per hour and 23 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.960
 kilometers per hour ago 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.780
 it allows us to move fast 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.490
 on the map and due to the small size we 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.190
 can not worry about that 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.680
 opponents with ease we will fall 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.039
 we can go to the rear of the enemy to shoot them 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.370
 at the expense of your drum and quickly change 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.949
 In general, the tank, I advise him very much 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.139
 good and on this the first part of this 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.360
 heading fits the end hope it to you 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.940
 liked do not forget to subscribe 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.580
 on the channel and put likes if 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.699
 most people will like this rubric 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.669
 then I will do the second part and by the way you 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.039
 can offer your options 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.139
 nominations on this all friends wish you 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.969
 all the best with you was 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.969
