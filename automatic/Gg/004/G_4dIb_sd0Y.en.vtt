reshoots and everything and then that

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.149 
reshoots and everything and then that
was<00:01:05.030> like<00:01:05.269> that's<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.439> won't<00:01:06.950> hit<00:01:07.130> us

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
publicity for part two I think but it's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.960 
publicity for part two I think but it's
definitely<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.450> start<00:01:11.689> of<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.939> know
