00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
that we had some challenges on were

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.220

those<00:01:23.320> three<00:01:24.100> windows<00:01:24.520> up<00:01:24.760> top<00:01:25.120> we<00:01:25.900> had<00:01:26.080> to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
those three windows up top we had to

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.110 
those three windows up top we had to
make<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.620> so<00:01:26.830> where<00:01:27.040> we<00:01:27.550> could<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:27.910> in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
make it so where we could get in

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.510 
make it so where we could get in
underneath<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.810> windows<00:01:29.380> but<00:01:29.650> yet<00:01:30.250> give

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
enough pitch to meet the code so we also

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.180 
enough pitch to meet the code so we also
had<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.060> work<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:34.480> with<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.110> elevation<00:01:36.010> and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
there that we had to work on getting

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.040 
there that we had to work on getting
around<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.460> tying<00:01:45.670> everything<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.810> went

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
around and tying everything in we went

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.750 
around and tying everything in we went
with<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.350> original<00:01:47.620> slab<00:01:48.160> instead<00:01:48.730> of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
with the original slab instead of

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.380 
with the original slab instead of
tearing<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.300> old<00:01:49.810> slab<00:01:50.140> out<00:01:50.410> and<00:01:51.330> pouring<00:01:52.330> a

tearing the old slab out and pouring a
new<00:01:52.570> slab<00:01:52.930> what<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:53.740> did<00:01:53.950> was<00:01:53.980> we<00:01:54.220> dug<00:01:54.670> up

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
new slab what we did was we dug up

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590 
new slab what we did was we dug up
underneath<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:57.220> existing<00:01:57.820> slab<00:01:57.970> we<00:01:58.300> pulled

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
underneath the existing slab we pulled

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.470 
underneath the existing slab we pulled
the<00:01:58.750> sod<00:01:58.960> back<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> two<00:02:00.520> by<00:02:00.730> two<00:02:00.760> foot<00:02:01.240> area

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
the sod back and a two by two foot area

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.270 
the sod back and a two by two foot area
where<00:02:01.990> each<00:02:02.230> of<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.560> load-bearing<00:02:02.920> post

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
where each of the load-bearing post

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.910 
where each of the load-bearing post
we're<00:02:03.580> at<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.970> dug<00:02:04.870> out<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.380> undermined

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
we're at and dug out and undermined

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.430 
we're at and dug out and undermined
underneath<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.550> slab<00:02:06.790> then<00:02:07.180> report<00:02:07.750> then

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
underneath the slab then report then

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.749 
underneath the slab then report then
called<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.100> an<00:02:09.190> inspection<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
called in for an inspection the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.820 
called in for an inspection the
inspector<00:02:10.300> came<00:02:10.479> out<00:02:10.720> checked<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.290> signed<00:02:11.590> off

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
inspector came out checked it signed off

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.100 
inspector came out checked it signed off
on<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.460> then<00:02:13.030> we<00:02:13.360> put<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.750> sod

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
on it and then we put the sod

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.200 
on it and then we put the sod
right<00:02:14.230> back<00:02:14.470> with<00:02:14.920> some<00:02:14.950> dirt<00:02:15.340> back<00:02:15.700> over<00:02:16.000> top

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
right back with some dirt back over top

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.060 
right back with some dirt back over top
so<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.870> can't<00:02:17.170> even<00:02:17.290> tell<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.800> were<00:02:17.890> ever

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
so you can't even tell that we were ever

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.580 
so you can't even tell that we were ever
there<00:02:18.310> instead<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.300> tearing<00:02:19.750> all<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
there instead of tearing all the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.700 
there instead of tearing all the
concrete<00:02:21.250> out<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.030> redoing<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.410> save

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
concrete out and redoing it so we save

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:32.830 
concrete out and redoing it so we save
some<00:02:23.920> money<00:02:23.980> there<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.520> customer<00:02:24.910> also

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.900
