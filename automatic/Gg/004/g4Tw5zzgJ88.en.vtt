 Attention Barbie headphones for a moment dtx 501 p 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.330
 we position them as headphones for 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.779
 use on the road while traveling 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.840
 a variety of reasons about which I am now 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 I'll tell you well, let's start with the configuration 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 have headphones come in such here 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 small cardboard box goes to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.770
 complete case and very solid look 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 the material that is it is sheathed with a cloth 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.680
 but the inserts there are some kind of solid I do not know 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.960
 cardboard there or 100 well as if in a bag 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.960
 Clearly the headphones will not be damaged. 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.260
 handle still there to carry them 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.600
 complete set are folding headphones dtx 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.110
 501 they go with a straight cord and with 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:09.060
 three and a half millimeter connector 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:11.369
 here is the first reason why they tell us 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.530
 seem to be more road 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.320
 than for home for example 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.439
 use this here in set in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 the delivery set is an adapter for 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:28.409
 aircraft audio output in in airplanes 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.280
 such double connector is often used 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 in the arms to listen to music or 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 movies broadcast when she monitors 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.530
 This is useful rayonchik perehodnichok 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.090
 Further headphones are another reason 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 why they are more expensive they occupy very 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 there is little space here if you take them 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.770
 the years just three centimeters of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.369
 thickness 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.930
 well, and so in terms of length 18 centimeters 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.149
 they add up then we have them in 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.189
 working position given in this way 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.700

 head that is not wide enough
