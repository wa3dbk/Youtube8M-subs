 you brought the coveted from the store 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760

 computer to play a couple of hours and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.830
 look at the calendar and now 10 years

00:00:45.540 --> 00:01:02.640
 our lives 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:01:05.190
 We think that your so too went to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 the end of 2002 like a bolt from the blue 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.140
 sky rang out they space rangers 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 before the release of the game no one even heard 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 she was not advertised on every corner 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 fans were counting seconds to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.410
 the long-awaited day of release probably exactly 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.970
 so those brave buyers are what they 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.550
 were afraid to spend money on 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.009
 unknown project incomprehensible concepts 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 tested at the first launch of the real 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.390
 shock because the disc with a nondescript picture and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.820
 stupid name written in 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.490
 the box was in the portal to the far 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 galaxy surrounding in itself with the head 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.930
 the other side of the monitor was waiting for us 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.909
 a huge world of dozens 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.979
 star systems filled with hundreds 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.840
 planets and space stations which 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.330
 generated randomly when 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.760
 starting a new game there is independence from 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.490
 players lived traded performed the task 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.350

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.220
 find a class to your taste 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.739
 the universe functioned according to its 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.519
 laws not paying attention to us we are to her 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.130
 weren't needed 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.850
 we for it was not an empty hole 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.220
 from a donut 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.260
 just do not be offended now in 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.300
 This had its advantages because we did not 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.460
 were 1 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.930
 giant gear cog in 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.310

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.990
 gold bracelet 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.700
 For example, carried away by some 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.620
 extraneous affairs could be 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.390
 miss the salvation of the world to others 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.460

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.460
 occupiers 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.690
 the highlight of the project were text quests 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.760
 old school 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.010
 interactive stories full of puzzles 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840
 and quite funny without evil humor 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 don't forget the nice sound track 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.760
 charming two-dimensional graphics are low 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.770
 system requirements and 5 endings and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.650
 it will immediately be clear why cosmic 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.300
 Rangers are so loved by the public later 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.160
 two years came the second part under 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.140
 name dominators who could 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.050
 break to the west and conquer quite a few 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.300
 hearts over the hill and in 2007 saw the light 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.400
 Collector's reprint of both games with 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.350
 all patches addons and heaps 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.950
 additional material so 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.720
 rangers 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.720
 and today is very much alive 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.510
 In May 2003, the pike appeared 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.090
 one sign game got then 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.280
 status of cult and legendary weiss city 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.500
 can not be called a breakthrough in contrast 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.110
 the very first part of the cat laid 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.599

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.150
 rulers the third dimension city of vice is not 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.550
 was as huge as san andreas 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.860
 And in one fist Niko Bellika perhaps 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.700
 more polygons than in all tommy 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.769
 versetti 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.650
 but this is all unimportant because many today 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.350
 Weiss City is considered the best episode 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.010
 saga about the great auto thieves for all her 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.169
 the story 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.389
 difficult to unambiguously answer the question in 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.940
 the secret of the incredible popularity of the game 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.070

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.419
 it used to be and then long though 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.639

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.250

 the right mood drives off fatigue and 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.510

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.580
 kill everyone who pleases 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.889
 it becomes even more pleasant weiss city 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.229

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.720
 if you try to conditionally break the story 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.910
 tactical turn-based strategy for the era 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.250

 fall somewhere under the table later 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.729
 years it is possible to recall only one minus 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:05.380
