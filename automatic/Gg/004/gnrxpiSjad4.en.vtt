00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.029
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.410
 video we will go to northampton 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.970
 discover the deception of michael and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.429
 see a little closer to hers 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
 find there so there you wonder 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.130
 maybe in the summer makes this video 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.870
 because it's more possible dallas 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.010
 north firm tons for a long time so 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840
 I tell you this video she was 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.129
 made today 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.480
 by the way, I brought the liberator back 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.040
 place there for proof 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.520
 so it's true that I could have also 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.379
 bring it back down to be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.719
 sure it defends a point 16 by 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.370
 example being a point May 15 like you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.320
 see on the mini map I already took 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.010
 a pegasus vehicle so the liberator 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.600
 and I can not bring back 2 more than that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.300
 would not have been convenient to walk to 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 northampton with the will drop for fairways 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.580
 from the cemetery to the lienne I needed 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.400
 of a vehicle that rolls so I have a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.630
 friend waiting for me there but I 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.310
 came back to the airport for you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.110
 show the path I took for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.130
 go there 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.710
 so there as you see the map l 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.880
 huge I have not searched in full for 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.530
 the video because it would have been 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.700
 a lot way too long so for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.100
 this time I only go to you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.750
 talk about michael and hers but 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.790
 after this video i will return well 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.650
 searched and if I discover other 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.240
 things I'm doing a video for you in 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.430
 speak 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 so there is also a problem of texture 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 that is, everything is fine 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.909
 visible 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.920
 but if we start to venture 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 anywhere you can fall into the void 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 and then you have to retype all the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.829
 way back to here so that's 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.100
 not necessarily practical 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.100
 after the ideal I know it would be coming 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.200
 here by helicopter to avoid 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.820
 precisely fallen into a black hole and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.560
 to be able to walk around 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.790
 but for this video there is no 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 need since I chose places 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.330
 quite targeted so I know they are 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590
 texture 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.900
 there is no problem on this one 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.010
 will not fall into the void so we come 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.330
 now in the city if you 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.090
 thanks you do not recognize yet 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.000
 it is normal it is night and seen from above 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.110
 it's not necessarily obvious there what 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 you see here it is the cemetery 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 so we landed right next to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.890
 the grave of michael 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.570
 so here we are on the grave of 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.970
 michael that you all know under the 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.340
 name of michael descent to except that here 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.020
 you will see that he has another name there 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.610
 my friend morning on the side with the 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.740
 liberator for us to see next 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.810
 hers so here on the grave is 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.460
 michael taoulet writing so that's the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.050
 michael's real name we know him 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.520
 with the name michael de santa but he has 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.170
 had to change people to make people believe 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.390
 that he was dead so to be able to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.300
 start his new life 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.010
 so we see below 1965 2004 so 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.510
 that that tells us two things first 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.040
 what it tells us is that michael 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.690
 was 39 when he made believe 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.450
 that he was dead and that he started his 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.220
 new life and the second thing that's 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.500
 that the prologue of gta 5 was therefore 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.180
 unfolded in 2004 what is a blink 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.520
 right at the exit of the game san 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.769
 andreas, who was also born in 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.600
 October 2004 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.070
 so there now we resume liberator 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.780
 and we'll go see her 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.280
 found under the ice so it's a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.050
 quite a long way to go 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.910
 so we'll have to speed up the 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.280
 video me perso I had missed 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.860
 become an orient of tons confess too 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.489
 that you missed you too watching 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.050
 it's still very pretty 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.790
 good to be here even though it has become a 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.769
 little apocalyptic since all this time 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.740
 as you see there is no vehicle there 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.080
 nothing 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.190
 after I also noticed something to 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.010
 about their talent firm but 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.530
 be careful there is a theory but 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.270
 it's heavy so 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.140
 so what I'm going to tell you here is 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:52.330
 my theory but it can be plausible 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.220
 so we will talk about it then as I do you 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.940
 have said many times in 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.440
 several videos 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.570
 rockstar gives us messages 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.130
 various through their easter egg 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.050
 so that is to say that every time we 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.350
 discover an easter egg there is always a 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.420
 message behind from rockstar 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.920
 remember for the bigfoot they we 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.140
 have shown that it is a disguised man 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.150
 so all that to tell us not to 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.190
 believe in this legend of big football and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.890
 to tell us that precisely the bigfoot 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.700
 does not exist in real 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.770
 remember also the UFOs so the 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.410
 eggs have UFOs we see well written 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.310
 have failed by above so that's for 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.110
 tell us all these stories 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.780
 around UFOs it's a machination 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.130
 invented by the fbi go there and they 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.950
 are just trying to make us believe 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.320
 things that do not exist in real life 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.730
 so short we know that rockstar denounces 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.960
 and we're going to talk about that 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.160
 again 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.590
 either they denounce or it's a 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.610
 coincidence I want to think that 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.680
 it may be possible 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.650
 so I'm talking about the theory the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.970
 initials of northampton cn there so the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.970
 same initials as new york ny also 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.050
 North Fenton is overgrown with snow 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.790
 strangely in recent years new 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.730
 york has suffered major storms of 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.890
 snow we've never seen before 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.450
 so how could rockstar be at 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.430
 current is what there is a message 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.540
 behind all this is that it's a 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.070
 simple coincidence 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.570
 knowing that rockstar does not let 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.120
 absolutely nothing random 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.720
 so it's up to you to tell me 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.210
 comment 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.470
 it is precisely a space to open the 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.020
 debate so here I think we need to open 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.050
 the debate on it so our firm 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.340
 ton m ny new york ny north fenton 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.710
 overgrown with snow 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.370
 the rockstar game was done lately 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.040
 years 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.780
 New York has suffered major storms 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.500
 snow in recent years what is this 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.470
 what do you think 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.100
 so there we find the famous aliens on 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.320
 finally gets there 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.270
 so what is he doing there in seen 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.810
 his position he does not seem to be 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.030
 quiet 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.410
 so what happened here perso 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.060
 I have no idea 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.389
 what I think is that since 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.550
 it's at the beginning of the game that we find 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.320
 precisely this alien it is to announce 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.090
 the color of what will happen after 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.900
 by showing us that there will be 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:09.139
 aliens to discover in the game so the 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.720
 famous aliens we'll see it's this 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.510
 movie aliens who are disguised who 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.320
 remove their disguises the 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.330
 flying saucers do things 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.560
 like that so what we can see is 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.690
 that he is very well drawn so that 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.740
 so it's a nice wink to the 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.620
 Following the game leave in comment your 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.789
 advice on the two things we talked about 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.139
 the alien michael after also talking about 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.760
 north firm stood on the theory that I 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.200
 have given you and we are going to leave each other 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.370
 on it and I tell you in the 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.370
 next ciao
