00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
 any perfect students of what was it 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.079
 that inspired to enter the gym to 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.320
 lift weights and follow the diet of the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.320
 supplementation 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 six years then 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100
 normal 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.340
 I wanted to lose a bit of weight 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610
 several of nobody 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.750
 the body 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440
 I change quite 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.440
 Quick 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.890
 we need the muscle you like, you like it 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.720
 can be strong and healthy and that the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.290
 people like 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.200
 ok now one thing you said bodybuilding no 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 you said female physique and you started as 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.430
 bodybuilders 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.430
 and now be 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.300
 it seems good 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.759
 and why I mean I see it as 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.909
 that women have more chances today in 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.909
 day 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.970
 what the woman is told I believe I do not 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.610
 Importance of sacrifice adjustment 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.760
 now he waits for me with a tourist 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.100
 to ricard to many things more loneliness like 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.250
 the recognition yes because actually 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.790
 It is quite a mention and the right hand 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.030
 to later not have the opportunity 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.030
 a lot of support 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.670
 now a question of what I had not 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.630

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 little of that relationship with her as I 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.250
