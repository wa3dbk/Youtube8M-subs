00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
jumps out out of a plane I'm assuming

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.870 
jumps out out of a plane I'm assuming
and<00:01:20.969> he<00:01:21.659> goes<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.429> can<00:01:23.579> see<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and he goes down and you can see that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
and he goes down and you can see that
the<00:01:23.969> whole<00:01:24.240> landscape<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.259> covered<00:01:25.649> with

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the whole landscape is just covered with

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.950 
the whole landscape is just covered with
water<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.520> mean<00:01:26.939> everything<00:01:27.359> is<00:01:27.479> covered<00:01:27.689> with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
water I mean everything is covered with

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
water I mean everything is covered with
water<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:29.159> some<00:01:29.429> parts<00:01:29.819> of<00:01:29.969> the<00:01:30.149> city

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
water there's some parts of the city

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.389 
water there's some parts of the city
where<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.049> seems<00:01:31.289> like<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.100> water

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
where the seems like the the water

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.840 
where the seems like the the water
hasn't<00:01:32.700> reached<00:01:34.159> hasn't<00:01:35.159> reached<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.429> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
hasn't reached hasn't reached that that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.249 
hasn't reached hasn't reached that that
level<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.359> city<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.899> think<00:01:36.929> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
level of the city and I think it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.169 
level of the city and I think it's
mainly<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.310> elevation<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.999> where

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
mainly because of the elevation of where

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.419 
mainly because of the elevation of where
that<00:01:39.299> particular<00:01:39.749> spot<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.679> know<00:01:40.859> it's

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
that particular spot is I know it's

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.230 
that particular spot is I know it's
close<00:01:41.819> towards<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.649> $400,000<00:01:43.649> house<00:01:44.240> where

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
close towards the $400,000 house where

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.499 
close towards the $400,000 house where
the<00:01:45.569> water<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.170> starting<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.679> kind<00:01:47.249> of<00:01:47.340> rise<00:01:47.609> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the water is starting to kind of rise so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.690 
the water is starting to kind of rise so
it<00:01:49.229> hasn't<00:01:49.380> covered<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.009> part<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> city

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it hasn't covered that part of the city

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.599 
it hasn't covered that part of the city
at<00:01:50.969> yet<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.929> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
at yet but I think it's like it's like a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.849 
at yet but I think it's like it's like a
this<00:01:54.389> reminds<00:01:54.689> me<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:54.959> of<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.289> movie<00:01:55.709> the

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
this reminds me like of that movie the

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.819 
this reminds me like of that movie the
2012<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.969> where<00:01:57.380> there's<00:01:58.380> gonna<00:01:58.499> be<00:01:58.679> like

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
2012 one where there's gonna be like

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.499 
2012 one where there's gonna be like

mod<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.859> I<00:02:07.889> did<00:02:08.190> fast-forward<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.000> video

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
mod now I did fast-forward this video

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.710 
mod now I did fast-forward this video
because<00:02:09.600> it's<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:12.360> video<00:02:12.569> was

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because it's actually like the video was

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.449 
because it's actually like the video was
actually<00:02:13.050> was<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.590> about<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:13.800> 9<00:02:14.040> minutes

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
actually was like about like 9 minutes

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.580 
actually was like about like 9 minutes
long<00:02:14.670> or<00:02:14.880> something<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.270> he<00:02:15.959> did<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.319> lot

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
long or something like that he did a lot
