00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 [Music] 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.430
 for nobody is a secret that in some 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.950
 from the corners of our homes we 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.040
 accumulates some humidity well in the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.420
 today the tip is supremely 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.340
 interesting and practical because we are going to 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.610
 learn how to make dehumidifiers 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.910
 homemade in a very easy way for that 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.910
 we need a white rice well 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.530
 a salt well 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 a soldering iron 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.560
 and a plastic mold with lid 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.600
 [Music] 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.210
 we proceed as follows 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.430
 we put to heat previously our 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.850
 soldering iron plug the mold 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.570
 and when it's hot, we start 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.200
 press on the lid 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.900
 making little rolls we are going to 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.390
 fill the lid of many many many 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.390
 little eyes 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:17.400
 this will only take a few minutes 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 [Music] 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.760
 this is practically ready 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.480
 we rest assuredly our 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.840
 soldering iron disconnected and how can 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.130
 account for the entire stage was covered 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.130
 of rolls 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.610
 what comes next is very easy 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 We will place inside the mold 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.030
 one a well the same measure we're going 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.030
 to have rice 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.929
 we're going to have salt that is to say we put 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.500
 a well of rice we are going to put a 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.740
 salt well 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.490
 and then we revolve it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.170
 that is very well mixed our 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.130
 ingredients 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.340
 [Applause] 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.910
 as you realize it is very easy 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.950
 it's totally effective I have them in 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.950
 I can recommend my house 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.870
 and when we realize that the 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.870
 mixture is completely uniform 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.239
 and we were very good that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.000
 is the site 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.140
 we cover the mold 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.300
 [Music] 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.730
 and we place it in the places where 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.310
 let's know that moisture is being trapped 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.980
 it can be in the kitchen cupboards 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.140
 can be in our closets or can 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.170
 be also in the apples where it 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.610
 it accumulates a lot of mold and moisture 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.610
 this will eventually sweat will go 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.380
 trapping what is formed with moisture 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.930
 that is a kind of mushroom and you what 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.750
 they can change every time they go to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.450
 check and see it totally moistened 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.459
 simply vacates the container 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.590
 does the mixing again and so 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.739
 we will have a homemade dehumidifier 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.630
 practical and very easy to do as well as 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.590
 these tricks you can find much more 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 in very feminine
