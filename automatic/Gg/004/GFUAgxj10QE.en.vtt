and I want to review my IWC world timer
this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.890> interesting<00:00:19.890> watch<00:00:21.020> that

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
this is a interesting watch that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.609 
this is a interesting watch that
contains<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.900> probably<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.170> considered<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
contains a probably can be considered a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.790 
contains a probably can be considered a
very<00:00:25.830> useful<00:00:26.310> complication<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
very useful complication in that it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.120 
very useful complication in that it
includes<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.970> time<00:00:30.439> for<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.980> postal<00:00:32.550> world<00:00:34.130> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
includes the time for a postal world the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.350 
includes the time for a postal world the
the<00:00:35.399> gist<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.380> as<00:00:37.380> follows<00:00:38.360> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the gist of it is is as follows the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
the gist of it is is as follows the
hands<00:00:39.750> show<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> time<00:00:40.760> in<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:42.090> local<00:00:43.670> home

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
hands show the time in your local home

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.729 
hands show the time in your local home
time<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:46.250> around<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> bezel<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:50.390> city<00:00:51.390> ring

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
time and around the bezel is a city ring

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.090 
time and around the bezel is a city ring
that<00:00:52.739> shows<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.640> 24<00:00:54.500> time<00:00:55.500> zones<00:00:55.530> at

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that shows the time in 24 time zones at

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.279 
that shows the time in 24 time zones at
the<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.840> does<00:00:58.050> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the same time and the way it does this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.609 
the same time and the way it does this
is<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.629> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> white<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> black

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
is that you can see this white and black

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
is that you can see this white and black
part<00:01:04.619> around<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.939> bezel<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:07.909> world<00:01:08.909> time

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
part around the bezel is the world time

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
part around the bezel is the world time
ring<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.189> turns<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:13.010> if<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
ring and it actually turns and if you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.980 
ring and it actually turns and if you
read<00:01:15.500> for<00:01:16.500> particular<00:01:16.770> city<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.360> number<00:01:18.750> next

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
read for particular city the number next

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.530 
read for particular city the number next
to<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> which<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> 24<00:01:20.400> hours<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.299> pretty

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to it which is in 24 hours you pretty

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.310 
to it which is in 24 hours you pretty
much<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.689> city<00:01:25.049> at

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
much get the time on for that city at

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.460 
much get the time on for that city at
that<00:01:25.560> particular<00:01:26.400> time<00:01:26.909> zone<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> works

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that particular time zone and it works

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.219 
that particular time zone and it works
very<00:01:28.710> nicely<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.150> shows<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.630> time<00:01:31.020> at

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
very nicely because it shows the time at

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.649 
very nicely because it shows the time at
any<00:01:31.470> point<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> shows<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> time<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.509> all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
any point and it shows the time in all

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.740 
any point and it shows the time in all
those<00:01:33.840> 24<00:01:34.320> time<00:01:35.100> zones<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> same<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.390> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
those 24 time zones at the same time so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
those 24 time zones at the same time so
you<00:01:36.840> never<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.970> don't<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you never have to you don't have to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.840 
you never have to you don't have to
change<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.549> always

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
change it at all the time will always

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.350 
change it at all the time will always
show<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.790> set<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.299> little

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
show so you do have to set it a little

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.190 
show so you do have to set it a little
bit<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.290> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> play<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
bit and kind of play with it so I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.760 
bit and kind of play with it so I
unscrewed<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.600> crown<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.290> an<00:01:52.409> automatic

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
unscrewed the crown it's an automatic

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
unscrewed the crown it's an automatic
watch<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.490> has<00:01:53.939> takes<00:01:54.210> something<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.570> 42

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
watch it has takes something like 42

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
watch it has takes something like 42
hours<00:01:55.290> power<00:01:56.250> reserve<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:59.640> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> work

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
hours power reserve you kind of work

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.319 
hours power reserve you kind of work
with<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.630> by<00:02:00.950> pulling<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.219> crown<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
with it by pulling the crown in the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
with it by pulling the crown in the
first<00:02:03.630> position<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.299> setting<00:02:06.500> your<00:02:07.500> local

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
first position and setting your local

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.580 
first position and setting your local
time<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.090> see<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.750> hours<00:02:10.170> jump

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
time and you can see that the hours jump

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.400 
time and you can see that the hours jump
so<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.330> fairly<00:02:12.599> easy

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so it's it's fairly easy

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
so it's it's fairly easy
as<00:02:13.620> you're<00:02:13.770> traveling<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.490> change<00:02:15.270> your<00:02:15.540> local

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
as you're traveling to change your local

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.440 
as you're traveling to change your local
time<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.500> what's<00:02:17.130> interesting<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.940> hours

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
time and what's interesting is the hours

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.750 
time and what's interesting is the hours
as<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:19.260> jump<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.890> actually<00:02:20.250> will<00:02:20.400> change

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
as they jump they actually will change

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
as they jump they actually will change
the<00:02:20.970> date<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.780> look<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> date<00:02:22.290> here

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the date if you look at the date here

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
the date if you look at the date here
once<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:23.490> past<00:02:24.200> 12<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.560> will<00:02:25.860> change<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.370> date

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
once I'm past 12 it will change the date

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.930 
once I'm past 12 it will change the date
and<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.660> date<00:02:28.200> change<00:02:28.560> backward<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.640> forward

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and the date change backward and forward

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.890 
and the date change backward and forward
as<00:02:30.030> well

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
as well

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650 
as well
so<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.440> go<00:02:31.710> backward<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.970> date<00:02:33.210> changes

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
so if you go backward the date changes

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.140 
so if you go backward the date changes
again<00:02:34.430> now<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.030> notice<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:37.400> city<00:02:38.400> ring<00:02:38.640> or

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
again now if you notice the city ring or

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.540 
again now if you notice the city ring or
the<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.720> should<00:02:40.110> say<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.320> hours<00:02:40.830> around<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the I should say the hours around the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.820 
the I should say the hours around the
city<00:02:41.730> wearing<00:02:42.000> never<00:02:42.540> changes<00:02:43.020> as<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.320> as<00:02:43.590> I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
city wearing never changes as I as I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.080 
city wearing never changes as I as I
used<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.880> crown<00:02:45.120> here<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.510> position<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.200> which

used a crown here in position one which

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.750 
used a crown here in position one which

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
for instance you travel from us to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.840 
for instance you travel from us to
Australia<00:02:56.790> or<00:02:57.300> back<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.770> US<00:02:59.070> then<00:02:59.550> your

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
Australia or back to the US then your

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.280 
Australia or back to the US then your
date<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.330> change<00:03:00.360> as<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:02.250> you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
date will change as you do this now you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.950 
date will change as you do this now you
would<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.320> already<00:03:04.890> had<00:03:05.310> set<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.850> time<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
would have already had set the time the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.320 
would have already had set the time the
our<00:03:08.390> city<00:03:09.390> ring<00:03:09.690> prior<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:11.040> doing<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.580> so

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
our city ring prior to doing this so

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.650 
our city ring prior to doing this so
that<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.620> particular<00:03:14.100> local<00:03:14.490> city<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.450> time

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that in a particular local city the time

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.980 
that in a particular local city the time
is<00:03:15.780> correct<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.260> I'm<00:03:16.830> in<00:03:17.070> West<00:03:17.820> close<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.720> Los

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
is correct so I'm in West close so Los

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.840 
is correct so I'm in West close so Los
Angeles<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.000> right<00:03:21.000> now<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.840> around<00:03:22.850> 9:40

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
Angeles and right now it's around 9:40

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.980 
Angeles and right now it's around 9:40
a.m.<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.740> can<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:27.180> nine<00:03:27.450> is

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
a.m. and you can see that the nine is

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.920 
a.m. and you can see that the nine is
near<00:03:29.900> Los<00:03:30.900> Angeles<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:32.190> let's<00:03:32.459> say<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:32.930> that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
near Los Angeles but let's say if that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.900 
near Los Angeles but let's say if that
time<00:03:34.140> was<00:03:34.350> incorrect<00:03:34.830> then<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.520> way<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.670> would

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
time was incorrect then the way I would

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.990 
time was incorrect then the way I would
change<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.390> by<00:03:36.420> pulling<00:03:37.140> on<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.700> crown

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
change it is by pulling on the crown

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.160 
change it is by pulling on the crown
again<00:03:39.390> at<00:03:39.870> last<00:03:40.410> position<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:41.190> turning<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.270> and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
again at last position in turning it and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.440 
again at last position in turning it and
as<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.440> can<00:03:43.560> see<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.220> turn<00:03:44.420> backward<00:03:45.420> or

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
as you can see as I turn backward or

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.500 
as you can see as I turn backward or
forward<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:46.560> city<00:03:46.830> ring<00:03:47.130> will<00:03:47.430> move<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.120> let's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
forward the city ring will move so let's

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.990 
forward the city ring will move so let's
move<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.170> exactly<00:03:49.620> nine<00:03:49.800> forty<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.430> you

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
move it to exactly nine forty and you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
move it to exactly nine forty and you
can<00:03:51.150> see<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:52.290> Los<00:03:52.830> Angeles<00:03:53.280> now<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.640> set<00:03:54.020> to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
can see that Los Angeles now is set to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.930 
can see that Los Angeles now is set to
nine<00:03:55.200> forty<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:57.980> just<00:03:58.980> need<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.310> press<00:03:59.730> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
nine forty and I just need to press it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.970 
nine forty and I just need to press it
now<00:04:00.239> everything<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.780> set<00:04:00.930> correctly<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.860> of

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
now everything is set correctly and of

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.620 
now everything is set correctly and of
course<00:04:02.220> as<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.700> would<00:04:02.820> expect<00:04:02.940> since<00:04:03.360> it's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
course as you would expect since it's

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.310 
course as you would expect since it's
9:40<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.010> Los<00:04:05.160> Angeles<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.790> New<00:04:05.940> York<00:04:06.320> you

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
9:40 here in Los Angeles in New York you

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.290 
9:40 here in Los Angeles in New York you
can<00:04:07.500> see<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.520> getting<00:04:08.640> close<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.270> being

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
can see that it's getting close to being

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.990 
can see that it's getting close to being
1:00<00:04:10.290> p.m.<00:04:10.860> so<00:04:11.760> 12:40<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:14.100> then<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.459> London

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
1:00 p.m. so 12:40 and then in London

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.810 
1:00 p.m. so 12:40 and then in London
it's<00:04:16.489> getting<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.910> be<00:04:18.140> 18<00:04:19.340> hours<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.549> 40

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
it's getting to be 18 hours and 40

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.890 
it's getting to be 18 hours and 40
minutes

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.629 

another<00:04:24.010> interesting<00:04:25.010> thing<00:04:25.040> about<00:04:25.250> this

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
another interesting thing about this

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.780 
another interesting thing about this
watch<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:30.310> everything<00:04:31.310> as<00:04:31.610> I

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
watch is that it everything as I

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.850 
watch is that it everything as I
mentioned<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.240> done<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> crown<00:04:33.260> so

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
mentioned is done to the crown so

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.110 
mentioned is done to the crown so
there's<00:04:34.790> no<00:04:35.000> pushers<00:04:35.480> at<00:04:35.810> all<00:04:36.850> nothing<00:04:37.850> else

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
there's no pushers at all nothing else

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.360 
there's no pushers at all nothing else
and<00:04:39.639> for<00:04:40.639> some<00:04:40.910> cities<00:04:41.330> such<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.590> London<00:04:42.889> New

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and for some cities such as London New

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.610 
and for some cities such as London New
York<00:04:43.700> Los<00:04:44.300> Angeles<00:04:44.330> renomii<00:04:47.470> there<00:04:48.470> is

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
York Los Angeles renomii there is

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.500 
York Los Angeles renomii there is
something<00:04:49.130> called<00:04:49.280> daylight<00:04:49.700> saving<00:04:50.060> time<00:04:50.090> so

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
something called daylight saving time so

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.159 
something called daylight saving time so
I<00:04:51.460> think<00:04:52.460> twice<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:53.090> year<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:56.510> fall<00:04:56.780> and

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
I think twice a year in the fall and

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.310 
I think twice a year in the fall and
also<00:04:57.350> in<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.620> spring<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:59.540> hours<00:04:59.900> jump

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
also in the spring the hours jump

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.409 
also in the spring the hours jump
forward<00:05:01.150> once<00:05:02.150> or<00:05:02.479> backward<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:04.150> this<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.330> be

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
forward once or backward and this can be

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.030 
forward once or backward and this can be
a<00:05:05.450> real<00:05:05.630> problem<00:05:05.870> because<00:05:06.110> how<00:05:06.650> do<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:06.800> know

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
a real problem because how do you know

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.940 
a real problem because how do you know
the<00:05:07.250> time<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:09.020> know<00:05:09.139> with<00:05:09.290> a<00:05:09.350> world<00:05:09.590> time<00:05:09.770> like

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
the time you know with a world time like

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.040 
the time you know with a world time like
this<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.340> know<00:05:11.180> you<00:05:11.240> have<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.570> change<00:05:11.870> it

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
this you know you have to change it

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.420 
this you know you have to change it
every<00:05:12.169> time<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:12.820> what<00:05:13.850> IWC<00:05:14.330> did<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.200> have<00:05:15.740> if

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
every time so what IWC did is to have if

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.240 
every time so what IWC did is to have if
you<00:05:17.030> can<00:05:17.210> notice<00:05:17.540> like<00:05:17.720> say<00:05:18.139> next<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.530> Santiago

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
you can notice like say next to Santiago

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.330 
you can notice like say next to Santiago
de<00:05:20.150> Chile<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.740> little<00:05:22.300> dot<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:24.169> goes<00:05:24.860> forward

de Chile a little dot that goes forward

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.080 
de Chile a little dot that goes forward
from<00:05:25.700> the<00:05:25.820> city<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:27.250> what<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.430> does<00:05:28.640> is<00:05:28.880> it

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
from the city and what that does is it

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.880 
from the city and what that does is it
tells<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:29.660> where<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.169> should<00:05:30.200> be<00:05:30.470> reading

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
tells you where you should be reading

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.430 
tells you where you should be reading
the<00:05:31.070> time<00:05:31.520> when<00:05:32.419> daylight<00:05:32.900> saving<00:05:33.229> times

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
the time when daylight saving times

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.350 
the time when daylight saving times
interaction<00:05:34.100> so<00:05:34.669> right<00:05:34.880> now<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.090> light

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
interaction so right now the light

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.520 
interaction so right now the light
saving<00:05:35.660> times<00:05:35.870> is<00:05:36.080> not<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:39.110> know<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.350> time

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
saving times is not so you know the time

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.790 
saving times is not so you know the time
in<00:05:39.740> London<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:41.410> 18<00:05:42.410> hours<00:05:42.770> in<00:05:43.100> Paris<00:05:43.550> it's<00:05:43.850> 19

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
in London is 18 hours in Paris it's 19

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.090 
in London is 18 hours in Paris it's 19
but<00:05:45.800> when<00:05:47.020> daylight<00:05:48.020> saving<00:05:48.380> times<00:05:48.620> would<00:05:48.919> be

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
but when daylight saving times would be

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.320 
but when daylight saving times would be
in<00:05:49.400> effect<00:05:50.919> you<00:05:51.919> would<00:05:52.100> have<00:05:52.220> to<00:05:52.400> just<00:05:52.610> read

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
in effect you would have to just read

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.409 
in effect you would have to just read
the<00:05:53.510> time<00:05:53.720> from<00:05:54.050> London<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.710> be<00:05:54.860> 19<00:05:55.520> all<00:05:56.090> the

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
the time from London to be 19 all the

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.020 
the time from London to be 19 all the
time<00:05:56.660> in<00:05:56.900> Denver<00:05:57.139> say<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:58.520> be<00:05:58.669> one<00:05:58.880> hour

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
time in Denver say to be one hour

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.480 
time in Denver say to be one hour
further<00:05:59.600> instead<00:06:00.229> of<00:06:00.320> 11<00:06:00.560> it<00:06:00.830> would<00:06:00.950> be<00:06:01.039> 12

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
further instead of 11 it would be 12

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.850 
further instead of 11 it would be 12
so<00:06:02.500> essentially<00:06:03.500> you<00:06:04.130> form<00:06:04.639> the<00:06:04.789> dial<00:06:05.060> can

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
so essentially you form the dial can

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:14.190 
so essentially you form the dial can
read<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:08.510> DST<00:06:08.870> time<00:06:10.270> very<00:06:11.270> very<00:06:11.450> useful<00:06:11.600> lunch

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.350 

very<00:06:15.200> useful<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.889> guess<00:06:16.160> and<00:06:16.910> I<00:06:16.970> should<00:06:17.180> say

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
very useful I guess and I should say

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.390 
very useful I guess and I should say
also<00:06:17.389> to<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:17.870> dow<00:06:18.020> and<00:06:18.680> you<00:06:18.770> can<00:06:18.919> see<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.220> way

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
also to the dow and you can see the way

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.909 
also to the dow and you can see the way
it's<00:06:19.580> configured<00:06:20.090> it's<00:06:20.600> very<00:06:20.840> much<00:06:21.080> like<00:06:21.710> in

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
it's configured it's very much like in

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.450 
it's configured it's very much like in
the<00:06:22.070> IWC<00:06:23.080> pilot<00:06:24.080> style<00:06:25.720> it's<00:06:26.720> a<00:06:27.250> it<00:06:28.250> has<00:06:28.430> the

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
the IWC pilot style it's a it has the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.880 
the IWC pilot style it's a it has the
same<00:06:28.850> kind<00:06:29.210> of<00:06:29.270> design<00:06:29.840> language<00:06:30.470> that<00:06:30.500> the

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
same kind of design language that the

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.119 
same kind of design language that the
big<00:06:31.039> palate<00:06:31.460> has<00:06:31.640> or<00:06:31.970> the

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
big palate has or the

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.019 
big palate has or the
Mack<00:06:32.279> 17<00:06:33.149> that<00:06:33.449> IWC<00:06:33.989> does<00:06:34.169> will<00:06:35.039> you<00:06:35.069> watch<00:06:35.729> for

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
Mack 17 that IWC does will you watch for

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.559 
Mack 17 that IWC does will you watch for
2012<00:06:37.069> in<00:06:38.069> terms<00:06:38.279> of<00:06:38.520> the<00:06:38.999> styling<00:06:39.449> is

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
2012 in terms of the styling is

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.320 
2012 in terms of the styling is
completely<00:06:39.989> different<00:06:40.909> it's<00:06:41.909> a<00:06:41.969> big<00:06:42.149> watch

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
completely different it's a big watch

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.679 
completely different it's a big watch
it's<00:06:42.809> 45<00:06:43.199> millimeters<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.209> love<00:06:45.209> to<00:06:45.389> log<00:06:45.539> I

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 
it's 45 millimeters and love to log I

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:47.629 
it's 45 millimeters and love to log I
think<00:06:45.899> it's<00:06:45.989> 55<00:06:46.409> which<00:06:46.860> makes<00:06:47.099> it<00:06:47.249> you<00:06:47.610> know

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
think it's 55 which makes it you know

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.609 
think it's 55 which makes it you know
sorry<00:06:48.029> neither<00:06:48.300> date<00:06:48.589> my<00:06:49.589> wrist<00:06:51.439> which<00:06:52.439> is

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
seven and a quarter it kind of fits

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.159 
seven and a quarter it kind of fits
nicely<00:06:56.309> I<00:06:56.819> like<00:06:57.089> to<00:06:57.209> wear<00:06:57.330> my<00:06:57.509> watch<00:06:57.689> is<00:06:57.959> very

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
nicely I like to wear my watch is very

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.719 
nicely I like to wear my watch is very
tight<00:06:59.179> so<00:07:00.319> took<00:07:01.319> a<00:07:01.499> while<00:07:01.619> for<00:07:01.649> it<00:07:02.009> to<00:07:02.069> fit<00:07:02.519> me

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
tight so took a while for it to fit me

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.509 
tight so took a while for it to fit me
well<00:07:02.969> because<00:07:03.769> certainly<00:07:04.769> the<00:07:04.919> alligator<00:07:05.339> is

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:05.519 
well because certainly the alligator is

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:09.199 
well because certainly the alligator is
top<00:07:06.059> class<00:07:06.240> and<00:07:06.629> very<00:07:07.439> hard<00:07:07.769> but<00:07:08.669> once<00:07:08.879> I<00:07:09.059> got

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:09.209 
top class and very hard but once I got

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.499 
top class and very hard but once I got
it<00:07:09.360> fitted<00:07:10.399> and<00:07:11.399> you<00:07:11.669> know<00:07:11.789> it<00:07:11.909> kind<00:07:12.149> of<00:07:12.179> works

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
it fitted and you know it kind of works

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.919 
it fitted and you know it kind of works
quite<00:07:12.929> nicely<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:14.490> bulk<00:07:14.699> oil<00:07:14.879> is<00:07:14.999> also<00:07:15.209> quite

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:15.929 
quite nicely the bulk oil is also quite

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:19.969 
quite nicely the bulk oil is also quite
nice<00:07:17.419> it's<00:07:18.419> a<00:07:18.449> very<00:07:18.629> nice<00:07:18.809> watch<00:07:19.050> I<00:07:19.409> wish<00:07:19.830> it

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
nice it's a very nice watch I wish it

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.909 
nice it's a very nice watch I wish it
was<00:07:20.159> a<00:07:20.189> little<00:07:20.519> bit<00:07:20.669> more<00:07:20.909> comfortable

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 
was a little bit more comfortable

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.739 
was a little bit more comfortable
probably<00:07:22.919> a<00:07:22.949> little<00:07:23.219> bit<00:07:23.429> smaller<00:07:23.849> but

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:24.749 
probably a little bit smaller but

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:30.319 
probably a little bit smaller but
overall<00:07:25.409> feels<00:07:25.949> very<00:07:26.309> solid<00:07:26.959> you<00:07:28.219> know<00:07:29.329> quite

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:30.329 
overall feels very solid you know quite

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:31.879 
overall feels very solid you know quite
useful<00:07:30.689> complication<00:07:31.229> that<00:07:31.259> I<00:07:31.469> use<00:07:31.619> a<00:07:31.649> lot

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:31.889 
useful complication that I use a lot

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.819 
useful complication that I use a lot
because<00:07:32.159> I<00:07:32.429> have<00:07:32.749> work<00:07:33.749> with<00:07:33.779> a<00:07:33.959> world<00:07:34.259> wide

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:34.829 
because I have work with a world wide

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.029 
because I have work with a world wide
team<00:07:35.129> and<00:07:35.429> it<00:07:36.240> tends<00:07:36.479> to<00:07:36.629> be<00:07:36.779> good<00:07:37.619> to<00:07:37.800> know<00:07:37.919> at

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 
team and it tends to be good to know at

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:40.269 
team and it tends to be good to know at
what<00:07:38.069> time<00:07:38.219> it<00:07:38.579> is<00:07:38.610> it's<00:07:39.059> in<00:07:39.209> Beijing<00:07:39.659> and<00:07:39.990> in

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:40.279 
what time it is it's in Beijing and in

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:44.419 
what time it is it's in Beijing and in
Tokyo<00:07:41.279> as<00:07:41.519> well<00:07:41.550> as<00:07:41.909> in<00:07:42.719> the<00:07:42.959> East<00:07:43.229> Coast<00:07:43.499> so<00:07:44.339> it

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:44.429 
Tokyo as well as in the East Coast so it

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:47.959 
Tokyo as well as in the East Coast so it
makes<00:07:44.610> it<00:07:44.759> quite<00:07:44.849> useful<00:07:45.649> anyways<00:07:46.649> um<00:07:46.919> I<00:07:47.309> have

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:47.969 
makes it quite useful anyways um I have

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:50.480 
makes it quite useful anyways um I have
a<00:07:47.999> full<00:07:48.479> review<00:07:48.629> of<00:07:48.929> this<00:07:49.110> watch<00:07:49.379> on<00:07:49.709> able<00:07:50.339> to

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490
