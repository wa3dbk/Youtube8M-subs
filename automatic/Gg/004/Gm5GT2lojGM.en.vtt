00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.420 
one there do that to every single one
one<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:43.080> one<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:45.050> whoops<00:02:46.250> might<00:02:47.250> want<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
one there one there whoops might want to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.830 
one there one there whoops might want to
fill<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.790> grass<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.480> don't<00:02:48.690> ruin

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
fill that with grass so you don't ruin

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.010 
fill that with grass so you don't ruin
this<00:02:49.020> sign<00:02:50.270> then<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.420> sort<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.720> put<00:02:51.840> one

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
this sign then you sort and put one

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.040 
this sign then you sort and put one
there<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.310> looks<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.570> sort<00:02:55.020> of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
there so it looks like that it sort of

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.000 
there so it looks like that it sort of
looks<00:02:55.200> like<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.350> soccer<00:02:55.770> pyramid<00:02:57.200> other<00:02:58.200> we're
