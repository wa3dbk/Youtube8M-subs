off because I blew him up just like I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.910 
off because I blew him up just like I
blew<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.310> his<00:01:08.460> hair<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.380> they<00:01:10.380> didn't<00:01:10.619> want<00:01:10.799> to

blew up his hair and they didn't want to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.120 
blew up his hair and they didn't want to
stay<00:01:11.400> curled<00:01:11.850> over<00:01:12.210> his<00:01:12.689> eye<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> only

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
way I can figure to do that was to glue

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
way I can figure to do that was to glue
them<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.890> place<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.610> blue<00:01:18.119> nothing

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
them in place and I don't blue nothing

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
them in place and I don't blue nothing
in<00:01:18.750> place<00:01:18.930> especially<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.009> keynesian

in place especially if I'm a keynesian

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.109 
in place especially if I'm a keynesian
in<00:01:20.790> public<00:01:21.270> places<00:01:22.369> it'd<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.580> great<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
in public places it'd be great for a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
in public places it'd be great for a
balloon<00:01:24.900> decoration<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> table

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
round black jump in there I thought

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.610 
round black jump in there I thought
about<00:02:47.640> putting<00:02:47.819> these<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.840> inside<00:02:49.290> but

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
about putting these on the inside but

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.280 
about putting these on the inside but
these<00:02:49.950> actually<00:02:50.370> help<00:02:51.000> hold<00:02:51.360> his<00:02:51.750> head<00:02:52.110> in

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
these actually help hold his head in

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.370 
these actually help hold his head in
place<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:53.220> spots<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.660> left<00:02:54.930> them<00:02:55.110> on<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
place in spots so I left them on the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.309 
place in spots so I left them on the
outside<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.640> could<00:02:56.970> roll<00:02:57.299> them<00:02:57.420> inside<00:02:57.989> you

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
outside you could roll them inside you

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.330 
outside you could roll them inside you
actually<00:02:59.209> putting<00:03:00.209> my<00:03:00.450> bottom<00:03:01.340> Doublemint

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
actually putting my bottom Doublemint

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.300 
actually putting my bottom Doublemint

really<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.440> how<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:26.010> your<00:03:26.220> design

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.210 

I've<00:03:29.790> also<00:03:30.060> tried<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:31.109> his<00:03:31.290> nose<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:32.040> I

actually bridge on feet if that doesn't

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.640 
actually bridge on feet if that doesn't
work<00:03:37.859> quite<00:03:38.250> as<00:03:38.370> well<00:03:39.109> then<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.290> look<00:03:40.500> for

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
work quite as well then you look for

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.900 
work quite as well then you look for
something<00:03:40.829> you<00:03:41.130> dress<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.209> down<00:03:43.670> but<00:03:44.670> that's
