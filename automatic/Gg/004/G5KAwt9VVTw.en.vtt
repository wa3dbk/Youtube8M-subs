00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.089 
happened last year I'm not exaggerating
I<00:02:46.930> saw<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:47.989> couple<00:02:48.170> different<00:02:48.500> times<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.829> the

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
I saw the couple different times is the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.979 
I saw the couple different times is the
opening<00:02:49.430> suitable<00:02:49.819> number<00:02:50.090> from<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.540> movie

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
opening suitable number from that movie

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.809 
opening suitable number from that movie
too<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.470> there's<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> couple<00:02:51.799> recent<00:02:52.400> films<00:02:52.730> you

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
too so there's a couple recent films you

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.460 
too so there's a couple recent films you
can<00:02:52.879> see<00:02:53.090> then<00:02:53.239> -<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.629> that<00:02:53.959> was<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.110> Disney

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
can see then - and that was a Disney

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.050 
can see then - and that was a Disney
film<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.980> occasionally<00:02:55.459> people<00:02:55.640> other<00:02:55.879> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
film so occasionally people other the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.910 
film so occasionally people other the
corner<00:02:56.390> brothers<00:02:56.659> humor<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.079> out<00:02:57.200> area

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.690 

if<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.400> out<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.640> back<00:03:00.940> like<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:03.130> storefront

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
if it's out the back like the storefront

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.400 
if it's out the back like the storefront
basically<00:03:04.270> you're<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.780> enough<00:03:05.080> room<00:03:05.290> in

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
basically you're just enough room in

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.949 
basically you're just enough room in
there<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> storefront<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.630> that's<00:03:07.810> all

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
there to do a storefront and that's all

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:08.280 
there to do a storefront and that's all
there<00:03:08.110> is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
there is

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.710 
there is
so<00:03:08.950> that's<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.220> facade<00:03:09.370> for<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.150> false<00:03:10.450> front

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
so that's a facade for a false front

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.380 
so that's a facade for a false front
they<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.650> these<00:03:11.890> big<00:03:12.340> buildings<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.000> all<00:03:13.240> of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
these buildings pretty much don't have
