00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.980
 here is marseille and today i show 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.099
 you the best class of black ops 2 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630
 As you can see I'm just level here 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.160
 52 and I hope to have one here too 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.049
 a little hard experience i believe 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.179
 I am at playtime 13 hours 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.250
 and yes I have the weekend already good 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.869
 That's why I wanted to give you mine 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.850
 to imagine the best class 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.590
 with it is the violent jam 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.880
 hello could happen under 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.640
 maybe even wanted to say 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.640
 what to say in the class like the location for 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.190
 Well then I'll start with the class 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.870
 And I have myself here for the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.950
 mp 7 decided which one has I believe 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 at the very beginning 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 that's why it's cool to be equal with it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.980
 can start playing 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 then I have on the mp 7 magazine 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 Enhancements and laser like I like their reader 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.550
 ira is just cool when you go out 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.969
 to shoot the hip one still has one 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 a little more precision and that works 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.730
 all a bit faster if you are 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.020
 not have to target angles for each 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.640
 then I have two extra 1 doing this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 You can do that by going down here 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.850
 left free-game charts extra 14 sets 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 then you can add one for each extra 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.020
 you could take a second take instead 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 also a third essay on the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.770
 primary weapon or on the secondary 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 weapons or somehow down here 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.689
 tactic danger zone I know now 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.950
 not what it is so i want four 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.500
 That's why I have here 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.180
 bulletproof vest and on each 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.100
 case lightweight balance is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 really cool if you are really blatant 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.229
 I would recommend you to wash 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 Light weight with increasingly bullet itself 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 You can take it with you if you improve 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.310
 Do not play on too small cards 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 you also take extra two hardliners 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.950
 is flick hÃ¤ndel yes I always find it 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.930
 cool if you are a bit fast 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 plays when you throw too fast 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.369
 Weimar can throw grenades quickly 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.460
 and otherwise use all things fast 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.469
 can and can quickly change weapon 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.240
 Extra 3 is technician is pretty cool 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.189
 if you play with stocks then you can 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.459
 you can change the stocks you can from 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.429
 hardliner pro from black ops i believe 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.340
 anything 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.290
 and at mw3 I do not think so 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.129
 so what or gem 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.349
 Do you know that with black ops 2 you could 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.909
 in black ops 1 you could with hard 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.639
 one pro to change 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:33.040
 then I have here primarily grenade c4 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:36.359
 while c4 already with jam what do you say 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.579
 the level 40 to you do not christ it 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:43.930
 but you have to level it up and we have to 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.069
 Anyway, I had good 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.500
 I have another space available 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.419
 a blitzgranate taken 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.579
 now I have tactics but 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.470
 I do not necessarily need that now 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.150
 and you can actually choose 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.530
 schott and always gets me pretty 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.359
 expensive shocked 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 that is not necessary 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.469
 would that goes not checkout 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.989
 so upset yes that is definitely 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.060
 the best class i will give you now 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.870
 after I get here almost 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.700
 I am the first prestige and I hope you 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.239
 can start something soon 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.269
 I get the mp 7 in gold too 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.280
 still need 13 headshots thanks the 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.409
 gold and see you next time 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.409
 and subscribe to my skin
