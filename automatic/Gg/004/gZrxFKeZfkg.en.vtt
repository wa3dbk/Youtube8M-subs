00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
um yeah there's that another thing is my

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.570 
um yeah there's that another thing is my
skin<00:06:44.210> um<00:06:45.210> a<00:06:45.650> guy<00:06:46.650> made<00:06:46.919> it<00:06:46.950> for<00:06:47.250> me<00:06:47.370> and

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
skin um a guy made it for me and

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.920 
skin um a guy made it for me and
apparently<00:06:48.530> it<00:06:49.530> looks<00:06:50.250> pretty<00:06:51.120> similar<00:06:51.780> to

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
apparently it looks pretty similar to

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.540 
apparently it looks pretty similar to
some<00:06:52.140> other<00:06:52.260> person's<00:06:52.710> I<00:06:52.830> think<00:06:53.280> his<00:06:53.370> name<00:06:53.520> was

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
some other person's I think his name was

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.150 
some other person's I think his name was
like<00:06:53.760> a<00:06:53.789> red<00:06:54.000> solstice<00:06:54.300> or<00:06:54.690> something<00:06:55.020> so<00:06:55.770> if

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
like a red solstice or something so if

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.130 
like a red solstice or something so if
you<00:06:56.340> see<00:06:56.580> him<00:06:56.669> any<00:06:56.880> as<00:06:57.060> like<00:06:57.539> a<00:06:57.570> similar<00:06:57.930> skin

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
you see him any as like a similar skin

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.210 
you see him any as like a similar skin
him<00:06:58.229> you<00:06:58.320> don't<00:06:58.380> give<00:06:58.560> him<00:06:58.620> hate<00:06:58.800> or<00:06:58.830> anything

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
him you don't give him hate or anything

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.440 
him you don't give him hate or anything
it's<00:06:59.370> just<00:06:59.430> because<00:06:59.789> somebody<00:07:00.120> made<00:07:00.240> him<00:07:00.419> a

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
it's just because somebody made him a

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.659 
it's just because somebody made him a
skin<00:07:00.720> and<00:07:00.930> the<00:07:01.620> person<00:07:01.860> that<00:07:01.919> made<00:07:02.070> my<00:07:02.190> skin<00:07:02.250> I

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
skin and the person that made my skin I

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:03.680 
skin and the person that made my skin I
don't<00:07:02.910> know<00:07:03.000> what<00:07:03.090> like<00:07:03.270> what<00:07:03.419> happened<00:07:03.660> with

don't know what like what happened with

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.029 
don't know what like what happened with
that<00:07:03.780> like<00:07:04.110> it<00:07:04.229> looks<00:07:04.380> like<00:07:04.530> really<00:07:04.710> similar

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
that like it looks like really similar

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.170 
that like it looks like really similar
so<00:07:05.310> I<00:07:05.340> don't<00:07:05.520> know<00:07:05.610> if<00:07:05.700> like<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:05.940> guy<00:07:06.030> that

made mine like copied it or something

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.500 
made mine like copied it or something
because<00:07:08.100> he<00:07:08.310> had<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.430> skin<00:07:08.700> first<00:07:08.910> but<00:07:09.180> I<00:07:09.210> i

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
because he had the skin first but I i

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.750 
because he had the skin first but I i

already have art for it and stuff so we

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.630 
already have art for it and stuff so we
decided<00:07:12.090> that<00:07:12.180> we're<00:07:12.360> both<00:07:12.450> going<00:07:12.690> to<00:07:12.720> keep<00:07:12.870> it

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
decided that we're both going to keep it

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.790 
decided that we're both going to keep it
so<00:07:14.640> yeah<00:07:15.240> if<00:07:15.419> you<00:07:15.539> see<00:07:15.750> him<00:07:15.810> if<00:07:16.410> you<00:07:16.530> go<00:07:16.650> to<00:07:16.680> his

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
so yeah if you see him if you go to his

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.190 
so yeah if you see him if you go to his
channel<00:07:16.860> or<00:07:17.160> whatever<00:07:17.570> and<00:07:18.570> like<00:07:18.630> he<00:07:19.080> has<00:07:19.169> a

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
channel or whatever and like he has a

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.170 
channel or whatever and like he has a
similar<00:07:19.560> skin<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:19.919> me<00:07:20.039> just<00:07:20.910> don't<00:07:21.000> give<00:07:21.150> a

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
similar skin to me just don't give a

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.820 
similar skin to me just don't give a
hate<00:07:21.390> or<00:07:21.510> anything<00:07:21.870> we're<00:07:22.410> both<00:07:22.560> gonna<00:07:22.740> have

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
hate or anything we're both gonna have

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.740 
hate or anything we're both gonna have
the<00:07:23.039> skin<00:07:23.250> I<00:07:23.340> guess<00:07:23.520> you<00:07:24.240> know<00:07:24.390> they<00:07:24.539> look

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
the skin I guess you know they look

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.420 
the skin I guess you know they look
pretty<00:07:24.990> similar<00:07:25.320> it's<00:07:25.860> kind<00:07:26.099> of<00:07:26.159> weird<00:07:26.370> though

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
pretty similar it's kind of weird though

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.620 
pretty similar it's kind of weird though
because<00:07:26.729> the<00:07:26.849> guy<00:07:26.940> said<00:07:27.180> that<00:07:27.210> he<00:07:27.330> made<00:07:27.539> it

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
because the guy said that he made it

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.180 
because the guy said that he made it
from<00:07:27.750> scratch<00:07:27.810> but<00:07:28.260> then<00:07:28.440> it<00:07:28.560> looks

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
from scratch but then it looks

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.970 
from scratch but then it looks
pretty<00:07:29.340> identical<00:07:29.520> to<00:07:30.180> his<00:07:30.960> and<00:07:31.500> he<00:07:31.800> got<00:07:31.920> that

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:31.980 
pretty identical to his and he got that

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.530 
pretty identical to his and he got that
two<00:07:32.340> weeks<00:07:32.520> before<00:07:32.670> mine<00:07:33.060> so<00:07:33.270> I<00:07:33.300> don't<00:07:33.480> know

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
two weeks before mine so I don't know

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.020 
two weeks before mine so I don't know
what<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:33.780> heck<00:07:33.900> is<00:07:33.930> up<00:07:34.140> with<00:07:34.200> that<00:07:34.320> so<00:07:35.030> yeah

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
what the heck is up with that so yeah

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.280 
what the heck is up with that so yeah
just<00:07:36.300> don't<00:07:36.390> give<00:07:36.540> him<00:07:36.600> hate<00:07:36.780> or<00:07:36.810> anything<00:07:37.170> if
