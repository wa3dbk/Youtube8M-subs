00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
going to talk about the transition game

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.109 
going to talk about the transition game
a<00:00:19.199> common<00:00:19.680> thing<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.609> people

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
a common thing that I see is people

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.150 
a common thing that I see is people
hitting<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> ball<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.320> getting<00:00:22.560> set<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
hitting the ball and getting set and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
hitting the ball and getting set and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
stopping and actually one of the master

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.779 
stopping and actually one of the master
keys<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.680> taking<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:26.160> tennis<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
keys to taking your tennis and your

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.189 
keys to taking your tennis and your

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
transition game to the next level is

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.439 
transition game to the next level is
moving<00:00:28.710> through<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> shot<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.970> I'm<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
moving through the shot so I'm going to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
moving through the shot so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.109> wrong<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.130> then

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
demonstrate the wrong way to do it then

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
demonstrate the wrong way to do it then
I'm<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> demonstrate<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> correct<00:00:33.780> way

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
I'm going to demonstrate the correct way

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
I'm going to demonstrate the correct way
and<00:00:34.469> we're<00:00:34.770> gonna<00:00:34.860> build<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.880> we're

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and we're gonna build on that we're

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
and we're gonna build on that we're
gonna<00:00:36.149> start<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.690> easy<00:00:36.930> progression

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
gonna start with an easy progression

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.650 
gonna start with an easy progression
with<00:00:37.920> ball<00:00:38.160> tossing<00:00:38.700> then<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.360> gonna<00:00:39.450> move

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
with ball tossing then we're gonna move

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
with ball tossing then we're gonna move
on<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.230> where<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> ball<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> being<00:00:41.100> fed<00:00:41.520> then

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
on to where the ball is being fed then

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.610 
on to where the ball is being fed then
I'm<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.390> ahead<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> move<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.140> trusty

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I'm gonna go ahead and move my trusty

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
I'm gonna go ahead and move my trusty
cone<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> my<00:00:44.670> trusty<00:00:45.120> thermos<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
cone and my trusty thermos which is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
cone and my trusty thermos which is
serving<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> cone<00:00:46.800> today<00:00:47.160> back<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
serving as a cone today back to the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
serving as a cone today back to the
baseline<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:50.190> more

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
baseline so that it's a there's more

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
baseline so that it's a there's more
distance<00:00:50.879> being<00:00:51.090> covered<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.960> watch<00:00:52.350> these

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
distance being covered so watch these

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
distance being covered so watch these
progressions<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> notice

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
progressions and we're going to notice

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
progressions and we're going to notice
how<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.289> improve<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.010> instantly

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
taking choppy steps very inefficient not

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
taking choppy steps very inefficient not
the<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> pros<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.680> doing<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.369> I'm

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
spot afterwards especially in this case

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.219 
spot afterwards especially in this case
I'm<00:01:29.790> hitting<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> ball<00:01:30.180> cross-court<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
run so I've got to get to the other side

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
run so I've got to get to the other side
of<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.540> center<00:01:33.990> stripe<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.799> cover<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> down

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
of that center stripe to cover the down

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
of that center stripe to cover the down
the<00:01:35.400> line<00:01:35.549> pass<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> next<00:01:36.570> shot<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the line pass on the next shot it's a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.749 
the line pass on the next shot it's a
great<00:01:37.439> drill<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.520> around

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
great drill you can do to go around

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
great drill you can do to go around
cones<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.360> somebody<00:01:39.720> toss<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> ball<00:01:40.350> have

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
cones have somebody toss the ball have

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
cones have somebody toss the ball have
somebody<00:01:40.829> feed<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> ball<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.150> work

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
somebody feed the ball and you can work

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:57.020 
somebody feed the ball and you can work
on<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.659> transition<00:01:43.229> game

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.610 

so<00:01:58.030> again<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.330> notice<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.780> balance<00:01:59.200> notice

so again you notice the balance notice

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.620 
so again you notice the balance notice
the<00:01:59.740> bigger<00:01:59.920> strides<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.640> ball<00:02:00.880> notice

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
the bigger strides to the ball notice
