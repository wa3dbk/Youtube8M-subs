00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.750
 for you 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:18.160
 now 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:20.760
 I already have my face shattered by more than 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 you stuck 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.130
 wait with the ham 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 I do not go out with turbo 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:45.260
 and it is already well - worn 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.260
 Water is the last 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.230
 funny always 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 how 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.520
 if you fail a little 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.680
 you have to brake too much 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.340
 if it goes like this 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.369
 the ramp 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.350
 it's the point 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.570
 that is all 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.110
 so I can not 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.540
 control 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.970
 Beware of fault drums not 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.800
 failure 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.800
 now it's gone a little 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.750
 Car 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.420

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.610

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.940

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.570
 let's go let's go 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:51.080
 if they do not have my level and no pignol 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.080
 finish this to open stadiums perfection 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.920
 if you have to learn 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.920
