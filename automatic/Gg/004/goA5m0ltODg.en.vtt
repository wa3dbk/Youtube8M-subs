let's<00:00:37.699> take<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.940> look<00:00:38.239> at<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.719> image<00:00:39.020> this<00:00:39.949> is

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
let's take a look at this image this is

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.549 
let's take a look at this image this is
an<00:00:40.219> editorial<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.449> shot<00:00:41.719> recently<00:00:42.289> and<00:00:42.469> it

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
an editorial that I shot recently and it

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.410 
an editorial that I shot recently and it
was<00:00:42.680> meant<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:42.949> feel<00:00:43.190> like<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:43.609> out<00:00:44.120> of<00:00:44.329> a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
was meant to feel like it's out of a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.090 
was meant to feel like it's out of a
different<00:00:44.600> time<00:00:45.079> it's<00:00:45.469> out<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.770> different

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
different time it's out of a different

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.360 
different time it's out of a different
age<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.570> perhaps<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:48.469> thought<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:49.010> adding

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
age and so perhaps I thought that adding

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.610 
age and so perhaps I thought that adding
a<00:00:49.460> texture<00:00:49.969> maybe<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.780> bit<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.350> grunge

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
a texture maybe a bit of a grunge

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.500 
a texture maybe a bit of a grunge
texture<00:00:52.039> will<00:00:52.460> be<00:00:52.579> perfect<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.090> make<00:00:53.329> this

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
texture will be perfect to make this

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.450 
texture will be perfect to make this
photo<00:00:53.750> feel<00:00:54.079> like<00:00:54.289> it<00:00:54.559> was<00:00:54.859> an<00:00:54.949> old<00:00:55.129> photograph

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
photo feel like it was an old photograph

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.790 
photo feel like it was an old photograph
and<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.870> can<00:00:57.199> I<00:00:57.379> mean

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
and you can I mean

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.229 
and you can I mean
don't<00:00:58.039> think<00:00:58.309> that<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.550> could<00:00:58.699> only<00:00:58.940> have<00:00:59.090> to

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
don't think that you could only have to

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.479 
don't think that you could only have to
have<00:00:59.329> grunge<00:00:59.600> textures<00:01:00.079> some<00:01:00.980> textures<00:01:01.370> that

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
have grunge textures some textures that

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.090 
have grunge textures some textures that
I've<00:01:01.579> taken<00:01:01.789> pictures<00:01:02.059> of<00:01:02.300> are<00:01:03.100> out-of-focus

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
I've taken pictures of are out-of-focus

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.610 
I've taken pictures of are out-of-focus
lights<00:01:05.030> which<00:01:05.690> I<00:01:05.810> can<00:01:05.960> then<00:01:06.080> overlay<00:01:06.440> on<00:01:06.590> a

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
lights which I can then overlay on a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.400 
lights which I can then overlay on a
photo<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.100> fake<00:01:07.520> lens<00:01:07.850> flare<00:01:08.210> I'll<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.140> take

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
photo to fake lens flare I'll also take

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.350 
photo to fake lens flare I'll also take
pictures<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.920> canvas<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.700> then<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:11.210> can

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
pictures of canvas and then I can

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.120 
pictures of canvas and then I can
overlay<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:11.870> on<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> photo<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.560> look<00:01:12.740> like<00:01:12.980> it

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
overlay that on a photo to look like it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.770 
overlay that on a photo to look like it
was<00:01:13.220> printed<00:01:13.640> on<00:01:13.820> canvas<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:14.540> you're<00:01:14.660> not

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
was printed on canvas so you're not

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.330 
was printed on canvas so you're not
limited<00:01:15.230> to<00:01:15.260> grunge<00:01:15.620> but<00:01:15.890> that's<00:01:16.040> what<00:01:16.250> I'm

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
limited to grunge but that's what I'm

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.920

I'm<00:01:20.930> going<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.290> open<00:01:21.470> up<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.890> texture<00:01:22.370> and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
I'm going to open up that texture and

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.080 
I'm going to open up that texture and
then<00:01:24.260> using<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.680> move<00:01:24.890> tool<00:01:24.920> if<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:25.550> hold<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.000 
the most powerful tools in Photoshop and
if<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.690> aren't<00:01:45.050> familiar<00:01:45.290> with<00:01:45.650> them<00:01:45.830> I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
if you aren't familiar with them I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.650 
if you aren't familiar with them I
definitely<00:01:46.460> recommend<00:01:46.730> diving<00:01:47.360> deeper

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
definitely recommend diving deeper

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.870 
definitely recommend diving deeper
learning<00:01:48.050> more<00:01:48.170> about<00:01:48.500> them<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.010> where<00:01:49.760> you

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
learning more about them and where you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.610 
learning more about them and where you
can<00:01:50.030> see<00:01:50.210> one<00:01:50.480> set<00:01:50.690> of<00:01:50.810> blend<00:01:51.020> modes<00:01:51.230> is<00:01:51.410> over

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
can see one set of blend modes is over

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.350 
can see one set of blend modes is over
here<00:01:51.950> above<00:01:52.280> your<00:01:52.460> layers<00:01:52.670> pallet<00:01:53.120> where<00:01:53.300> it

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
here above your layers pallet where it

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.720 
here above your layers pallet where it
says<00:01:53.540> normal<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.590> have<00:01:54.710> all<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.550> these

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
says normal you have all of these

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.090 
says normal you have all of these
different<00:01:56.120> options<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.050> what<00:01:57.500> they<00:01:57.650> do<00:01:57.710> is

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
different options and what they do is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.280 
different options and what they do is
they<00:01:58.280> change<00:01:58.310> how<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:58.940> layer<00:01:59.330> interacts<00:02:00.020> with

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
they change how a layer interacts with

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.590 
they change how a layer interacts with
the<00:02:00.380> layer<00:02:00.620> below<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:02.180> what<00:02:02.390> does<00:02:02.570> that

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the layer below it so what does that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.090 
the layer below it so what does that
mean<00:02:03.020> let<00:02:03.230> me<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:03.470> cycle<00:02:03.860> through<00:02:03.890> a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
mean let me just cycle through a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.070 
mean let me just cycle through a
different<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.700> couple<00:02:04.970> different<00:02:05.420> examples<00:02:05.900> so

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
different a couple different examples so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.320 
different a couple different examples so
if<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.260> change<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.770> texture<00:02:07.280> layer<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.730> if

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
if I change this texture layer and if

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.240 
if I change this texture layer and if
you<00:02:08.420> look<00:02:08.629> if<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.259> turn<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.619> off<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.069> have<00:02:10.099> the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
you look if I turn it off you have the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.190 
you look if I turn it off you have the
original<00:02:10.340> photo<00:02:10.789> underneath<00:02:11.209> ok<00:02:11.870> let<00:02:11.959> me<00:02:12.050> turn

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
original photo underneath ok let me turn

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.690 
original photo underneath ok let me turn
on<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.440> texture<00:02:12.859> layer

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
on that texture layer

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.740 
on that texture layer
if<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.480> change<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> darken<00:02:16.000> what<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.150> does<00:02:17.390> is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
if I change it to darken what it does is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.820 
if I change it to darken what it does is
the<00:02:18.590> texture<00:02:19.099> will<00:02:19.250> only<00:02:19.550> be<00:02:20.060> visible<00:02:20.830> where

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the texture will only be visible where

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.990 
the texture will only be visible where
the<00:02:22.040> top<00:02:22.340> photo<00:02:22.849> was<00:02:23.390> darker<00:02:23.959> than<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.500> bottom

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the top photo was darker than the bottom

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.180 
the top photo was darker than the bottom
so<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> top<00:02:26.420> photo<00:02:26.780> was<00:02:27.380> darker<00:02:27.890> than<00:02:28.069> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
so the top photo was darker than the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.280 
so the top photo was darker than the
bottom<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.970> arms<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:29.989> face

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
bottom in the arms and in the face

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.890 
bottom in the arms and in the face
because<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.770> face<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.040> very<00:02:31.340> light<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:32.780> will

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
because the face is very light can will

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.590 
because the face is very light can will
let's<00:02:33.080> switch<00:02:33.350> how<00:02:33.500> about<00:02:33.650> light<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
let's switch how about light in the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.990 
let's switch how about light in the
photo<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.110> texture<00:02:36.709> will<00:02:36.890> show<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.280> wherever

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
photo the texture will show up wherever

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.570 
photo the texture will show up wherever
that<00:02:38.360> texture<00:02:38.780> was<00:02:38.959> lighter<00:02:39.290> than<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.370> photo

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
that texture was lighter than the photo

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.300 
that texture was lighter than the photo
beneath<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.410> can<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:42.860> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
beneath it and so you can see the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.520 
beneath it and so you can see the
texture<00:02:43.610> shows<00:02:43.910> up<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.780> background<00:02:45.290> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
texture shows up in the background and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.199 
texture shows up in the background and
the<00:02:45.590> darkness<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.160> her<00:02:46.280> hat<00:02:46.580> wherever<00:02:46.970> that

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
the darkness of her hat wherever that

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.290 
the darkness of her hat wherever that
base<00:02:47.630> photo<00:02:47.989> was<00:02:48.410> darker<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.610> there's<00:02:50.150> all

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
base photo was darker and there's all

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.520 
base photo was darker and there's all
these<00:02:50.450> different<00:02:50.510> things<00:02:50.810> some<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.230> them<00:02:51.410> play

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
these different things some of them play

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.949 
these different things some of them play
with<00:02:51.590> contrast<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.489> overlay<00:02:52.910> soft<00:02:53.720> light

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
with contrast it's overlay soft light

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.509 
with contrast it's overlay soft light
hard<00:02:54.230> light<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:54.950> gonna<00:02:55.069> tell<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
hard light so I'm gonna tell you the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.270 
hard light so I'm gonna tell you the
ones<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.940> recommend<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.569> try

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
ones that I recommend that you try

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960 
ones that I recommend that you try
typically<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.790> want<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.209> try<00:02:59.450> multiply

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
typically you want to try multiply

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.250 
typically you want to try multiply
overlay<00:03:01.970> or<00:03:02.090> soft<00:03:02.360> light<00:03:02.540> first<00:03:02.780> those<00:03:03.019> those

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
overlay or soft light first those those

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.110 
overlay or soft light first those those
tend<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.830> first<00:03:04.069> ones<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.519> try<00:03:04.850> but

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
tend to be the first ones that I try but

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240 
tend to be the first ones that I try but
definitely<00:03:05.840> try<00:03:06.019> out<00:03:06.049> darken<00:03:06.560> definitely<00:03:07.010> try

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
definitely try out darken definitely try

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.259 
definitely try out darken definitely try
out<00:03:07.280> light<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.549> they<00:03:07.760> all<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> different

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
out light and they all have a different

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.360 
out light and they all have a different
effect<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.989> it's<00:03:09.080> going<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.290> depend<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:10.010> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
effect and it's going to depend on the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.009 
effect and it's going to depend on the
bottom<00:03:10.700> photograph<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.690> course<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
bottom photograph and of course on the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.920 
bottom photograph and of course on the
texture<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.440> you've<00:03:12.650> selected<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:14.510> for<00:03:14.810> this

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
texture that you've selected so for this

texture that you've selected so for this
particular<00:03:15.200> image<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.069> like<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.790> grunge

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
particular image I do like that grunge

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.199 
particular image I do like that grunge
look<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:17.989> get<00:03:18.350> when<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.739> apply<00:03:19.220> soft<00:03:19.880> light

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
look that I get when I apply soft light

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.870 
look that I get when I apply soft light
as<00:03:20.480> my<00:03:20.540> blend<00:03:21.260> mode<00:03:21.410> but<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> problem<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.370> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
as my blend mode but the problem is the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.449 
as my blend mode but the problem is the
color<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.510> messing<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.079> up<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.799> don't<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.400> don't

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
color is messing it up I don't I don't

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.400 
color is messing it up I don't I don't
want<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.730> color<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.090> show<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.720> that's<00:03:27.200> what

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
want the color to show and that's what

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.660 
want the color to show and that's what
happens<00:03:27.739> when<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:27.950> play<00:03:28.130> with<00:03:28.160> these

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
happens when you play with these

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.910 
happens when you play with these
particular<00:03:28.940> blend<00:03:29.450> modes<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.500> one<00:03:30.680> thing<00:03:30.890> that

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
particular blend modes so one thing that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.620 
particular blend modes so one thing that
I<00:03:31.040> could<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.850> could<00:03:31.910> go<00:03:32.120> up<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.480> go<00:03:32.570> to

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
I could do is I could go up and go to

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.590 
I could do is I could go up and go to
image<00:03:33.430> adjustments<00:03:34.430> desaturate<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:35.540> is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
image adjustments desaturate and is

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.150 
image adjustments desaturate and is
going<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.780> pull<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.290> color<00:03:36.560> out<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:37.040> that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
going to pull the color out of that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.190 
going to pull the color out of that
particular<00:03:37.640> layer<00:03:37.850> now<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.720> going<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.049> be

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
particular layer now that is going to be

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.580 
particular layer now that is going to be
much<00:03:39.890> more<00:03:40.190> pleasing<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.670> my<00:03:41.000> eye<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:42.440> there's

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
much more pleasing to my eye but there's

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.500 
much more pleasing to my eye but there's
a<00:03:42.680> couple<00:03:42.859> other<00:03:43.160> things<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.609> I<00:03:43.730> don't<00:03:44.060> quite

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
a couple other things that I don't quite

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.110 
a couple other things that I don't quite
like<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.410> don't<00:03:45.739> exactly<00:03:46.220> like<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.670> texture<00:03:47.090> on

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
like I don't exactly like the texture on

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.780 
like I don't exactly like the texture on
her<00:03:47.329> arms<00:03:47.780> or<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.049> her<00:03:48.230> face<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:49.340> what's<00:03:49.519> great

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
her arms or on her face but what's great

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.720 
her arms or on her face but what's great
is<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.269> can<00:03:50.510> use<00:03:50.660> layer<00:03:51.019> masks<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.579> the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
is I can use layer masks so on the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.699 
is I can use layer masks so on the
layers<00:03:52.940> palette<00:03:53.180> on<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.450> bottom<00:03:54.049> there's<00:03:54.650> a

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
layers palette on the bottom there's a

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.530 
layers palette on the bottom there's a
rectangle<00:03:55.250> with<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.400> circle<00:03:55.820> on<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> when<00:03:56.420> I'm

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
rectangle with a circle on it when I'm

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.849 
rectangle with a circle on it when I'm
selected<00:03:57.019> on<00:03:57.109> my<00:03:57.230> texture<00:03:57.560> I'm<00:03:57.650> going<00:03:57.769> to

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
selected on my texture I'm going to

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.710 
selected on my texture I'm going to
click<00:03:58.069> on<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.400> icon<00:03:58.609> that<00:03:59.000> says<00:03:59.180> add<00:03:59.420> layer

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
click on that icon that says add layer

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.840 
click on that icon that says add layer
mask<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.260> what<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.530> does<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.890> adds<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.310> mask<00:04:01.579> to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
mask and what it does is adds a mask to

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.259 
mask and what it does is adds a mask to
that<00:04:02.000> photograph<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.590> white<00:04:04.269> wherever

that photograph and it is white wherever
you<00:04:05.569> see<00:04:05.870> white<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.890> texture<00:04:07.430> next<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.819> it<00:04:07.880> is

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
you see white the texture next to it is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.539 
you see white the texture next to it is
visible<00:04:08.450> which<00:04:09.019> we<00:04:09.440> can<00:04:09.620> see<00:04:09.769> here<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:10.220> added

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
visible which we can see here it added

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.000 
visible which we can see here it added
that<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.880> didn't<00:04:11.090> change<00:04:11.120> anything<00:04:11.829> but<00:04:12.829> now

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
that it didn't change anything but now

if<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.310> grab<00:04:13.639> a<00:04:13.850> black<00:04:14.209> brush<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.139> I<00:04:15.769> paint<00:04:16.100> on

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
if I grab a black brush and I paint on

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
that mask wherever I paint black it's

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.630 
that mask wherever I paint black it's
going<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.510> hide<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:21.049> texture<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.370> what<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.520> can

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
going to hide that texture so what I can

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.240 
going to hide that texture so what I can
do<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:23.900> slowly<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.530> can<00:04:24.650> pick<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:24.800> low<00:04:25.010> flow

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
do is I can slowly I can pick a low flow

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.080 
do is I can slowly I can pick a low flow
or<00:04:25.490> low<00:04:25.640> pass

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
if you're not familiar with that and I

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.700 
if you're not familiar with that and I
can<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:28.669> start<00:04:28.880> painting<00:04:29.270> wherever<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.350> paint

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
can just start painting wherever I paint

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.240 
can just start painting wherever I paint
black<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:32.000> hides<00:04:32.540> that<00:04:32.930> texture<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.040> can

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
black it hides that texture so I can

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.580 
black it hides that texture so I can
hide<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.700> texture<00:04:35.120> off<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.389> her<00:04:35.510> face<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.110> off

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
hide the texture off of her face and off

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.320 
hide the texture off of her face and off
of<00:04:36.800> her<00:04:36.919> arms<00:04:37.250> or<00:04:37.430> maybe<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.700> don't<00:04:37.790> want<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.150> on

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
of her arms or maybe I don't want to on

of her arms or maybe I don't want to on
her<00:04:38.540> hair<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.680> now<00:04:39.830> look<00:04:40.070> at<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.280> before<00:04:40.430> and

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
her hair so now look at the before and

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.940 
her hair so now look at the before and
after<00:04:40.820> I've<00:04:41.510> added<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:42.020> grunge<00:04:42.350> look<00:04:42.470> but

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
after I've added that grunge look but

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.470 
after I've added that grunge look but
I've<00:04:43.070> still<00:04:43.280> kept<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.669> integrity<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:44.240> the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
I've still kept the integrity of the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.260 
I've still kept the integrity of the
purity<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.020> her<00:04:45.350> skin<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.520> there<00:04:46.669> is<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.820> quick

overview of some of the ways that you
might<00:04:49.040> use<00:04:49.070> texture<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.700> add<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.850> little<00:04:50.180> bit<00:04:50.389> of

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
might use texture to add a little bit of

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.720 
might use texture to add a little bit of
visual<00:04:50.900> interest<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.470> your<00:04:51.590> photos<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.520> don't
