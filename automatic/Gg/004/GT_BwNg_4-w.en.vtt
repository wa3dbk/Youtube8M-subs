00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
probably the weaker one even though I

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.800 
probably the weaker one even though I
consider<00:01:37.760> myself<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:38.120> good<00:01:38.150> female<00:01:38.390> play<00:01:38.630> but

consider myself a good female play but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.090 
consider myself a good female play but
enough<00:01:39.080> about<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.380> let's<00:01:39.770> go<00:01:39.890> ahead<00:01:39.920> and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
enough about that let's go ahead and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.710 
enough about that let's go ahead and
right<00:01:40.340> into<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.670> rule<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.240> throughout<00:01:41.570> the

right into the rule so throughout the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
in the comments to put as my um fato

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.490 
in the comments to put as my um fato
player<00:02:41.640> upgrades<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.350> what<00:02:43.470> i

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
player upgrades it's if you get what i

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.680 
player upgrades it's if you get what i
mean<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.740> basically<00:02:44.640> all<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.850> my<00:02:45.150> silver<00:02:45.480> cars

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
mean so basically all of my silver cars

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.280 
mean so basically all of my silver cars
will<00:02:45.840> eventually<00:02:46.380> become<00:02:46.530> gold<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:48.570> forms<00:02:49.110> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
will eventually become gold in forms and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.560 
will eventually become gold in forms and
possibly<00:02:49.740> even<00:02:49.830> higher<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.700> hopefully<00:02:51.390> we<00:02:51.480> had

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
possibly even higher so hopefully we had

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.390 
possibly even higher so hopefully we had
a<00:02:51.600> lot<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.780> coins<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.010> first

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
a lot of coins in the in the first

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.010 
a lot of coins in the in the first

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
couple of games so we can start off with

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.830 
couple of games so we can start off with
a<00:02:55.050> with<00:02:55.320> with<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.220> bank<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.720> than
