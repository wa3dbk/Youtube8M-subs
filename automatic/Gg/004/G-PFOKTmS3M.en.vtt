00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
on and I think it's a really effective

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.729 
on and I think it's a really effective
way<00:03:43.180> for<00:03:44.099> athletes<00:03:45.099> and<00:03:45.310> people<00:03:45.609> in<00:03:45.730> sports<00:03:46.090> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
way for athletes and people in sports to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.490 
way for athletes and people in sports to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
control the message twittering during

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.620 
control the message twittering during
games<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.579> at<00:03:51.669> halftime<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.359> things<00:03:52.480> like

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
games and at halftime and things like

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.000 
games and at halftime and things like
that<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.200> know<00:03:53.230> leagues<00:03:53.500> are<00:03:53.680> starting<00:03:53.950> to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
that it you know leagues are starting to

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.800 
that it you know leagues are starting to
come<00:03:54.160> around<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.609> come<00:03:55.060> down<00:03:55.269> on<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:55.750> I

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
come around and come down on that and I

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.270 
come around and come down on that and I
think<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.139> that<00:03:56.230> was<00:03:56.380> sort<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.620> novel<00:03:57.099> and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
think that that was sort of novel and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.009 
think that that was sort of novel and
and<00:03:57.459> cute<00:03:58.060> at<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.359> beginning<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
and cute at the beginning but that

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.330 
and cute at the beginning but that
that's<00:03:59.319> something<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.889> we're<00:04:00.130> probably

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
that's something that we're probably

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.240 
that's something that we're probably
gonna<00:04:00.609> see<00:04:00.880> go<00:04:01.060> away<00:04:01.389> how<00:04:02.260> do<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.410> see<00:04:02.590> your

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
gonna see go away how do you see your

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.039 
gonna see go away how do you see your
SportsCenter<00:04:03.849> evolving<00:04:04.419> it's<00:04:04.629> been<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> year

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
SportsCenter evolving it's been a year

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.990 
SportsCenter evolving it's been a year
how<00:04:05.230> do<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.440> see<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.769> maybe<00:04:05.980> for<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.310> next<00:04:06.609> 12

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
how do you see it maybe for the next 12

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.729 
how do you see it maybe for the next 12
months<00:04:07.060> or<00:04:07.389> is<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.690> really<00:04:07.989> tough<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.590> tell

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
months or is it really tough to tell

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.409 
months or is it really tough to tell
with<00:04:08.950> technology<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:09.879> mean<00:04:10.150> we<00:04:10.209> talked

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
with technology and I mean we talked

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.629 
with technology and I mean we talked
again<00:04:10.629> about<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.959> virtual<00:04:11.440> reality<00:04:11.639> right

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
again about that virtual reality right

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.580 
again about that virtual reality right
it's<00:04:12.849> always<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:13.810> always<00:04:14.049> changing

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
it's always it's it's always changing

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.960 
it's always it's it's always changing
it'll<00:04:14.769> continue<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.220> change<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.849> I<00:04:15.940> think

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
it'll continue to change and I think

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.819 
it'll continue to change and I think
that<00:04:16.329> technology<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.199> know<00:04:17.289> whether<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.680> be

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
that technology you know whether it be

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.170 
that technology you know whether it be
you<00:04:18.010> know<00:04:18.099> what<00:04:18.250> we're<00:04:18.370> able<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.669> do<00:04:18.820> with<00:04:19.000> our

those around or you know or some other
new<00:04:24.910> kind<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.210> technology<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.780> mean<00:04:25.900> our<00:04:26.229> Sports

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560

a<00:04:28.719> lot<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.020> things<00:04:29.110> are<00:04:29.440> done<00:04:29.620> even<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.130> know

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:30.219 
a lot of things are done even you know

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.530 
a lot of things are done even you know
down

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
down

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.300 
down
our<00:04:30.600> camera<00:04:31.050> shots<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.500> how<00:04:31.560> we<00:04:31.620> are<00:04:31.800> moving

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
all over the studio I think the attitude

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
to see us more and I think we will more

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.020 
to see us more and I think we will more
go<00:04:58.830> after<00:04:59.100> newsmakers

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
go after newsmakers

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.690 
go after newsmakers
so<00:05:00.180> rather<00:05:00.570> than<00:05:00.720> maybe<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:02.340> know<00:05:02.430> if

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
so rather than maybe you know if

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.790 
so rather than maybe you know if
something<00:05:03.090> happens<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:04.080> night<00:05:04.230> before<00:05:04.440> you

something happens the night before you
know<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.010> honest<00:05:05.310> it's<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.520> turbo<00:05:05.700> play<00:05:06.000> maybe

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
know the honest it's a turbo play maybe

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.370 
know the honest it's a turbo play maybe
it's<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.660> know<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.870> guy<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.020> was<00:05:07.200> in<00:05:07.320> the
