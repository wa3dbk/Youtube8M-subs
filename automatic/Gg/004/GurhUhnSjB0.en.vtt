00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
we'd talk about difficult bunker

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.360 
we'd talk about difficult bunker
conditions<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.870> I've<00:00:10.530> got<00:00:10.710> an<00:00:10.830> example<00:00:11.190> here

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
conditions and I've got an example here

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.009 
conditions and I've got an example here
where<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.849> don't<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.210> much<00:00:12.360> sand<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.900> this

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
where we don't have much sand in this

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.839 
where we don't have much sand in this
bunker<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.590> very<00:00:13.799> hard<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.670> that

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
bunker it's very hard how do I know that

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.300 
bunker it's very hard how do I know that
an<00:00:15.780> easy<00:00:15.960> way<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> tell<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:16.770> there's<00:00:16.980> not<00:00:17.100> much

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
an easy way to tell if there's not much

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.580 
an easy way to tell if there's not much
sand<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> bunker<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.020> dig<00:00:19.230> your<00:00:19.380> feet

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
sand in the bunker is to dig your feet

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.410 
sand in the bunker is to dig your feet
in<00:00:19.800> when<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.070> get<00:00:20.160> set<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.029> your<00:00:21.180> feet

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
in when you get set up and if your feet

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.750 
in when you get set up and if your feet
don't<00:00:21.720> dig<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:22.890> then<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
don't dig in at all then you know that

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.500 
don't dig in at all then you know that
the<00:00:23.850> bunker<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.449> very<00:00:25.460> full<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> very<00:00:27.180> firm

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the bunker is very full of very firm

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.500 
the bunker is very full of very firm
sand<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> we've<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> situation<00:00:30.240> here

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
sand so we've got that situation here

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.870 
sand so we've got that situation here
and<00:00:30.890> we<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.160> sure<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.759> don't

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and we want to make sure that we don't

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180 
and we want to make sure that we don't
use<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> club<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> has<00:00:33.780> bounced<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.860> sand

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
use a club that has bounced your sand

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.889 
use a club that has bounced your sand
wedge<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.700> bounced<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> good

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
wedge has bounced so this is a good

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
wedge has bounced so this is a good
opportunity<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> use<00:00:38.250> something

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
opportunity for you to use something

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
opportunity for you to use something
other<00:00:38.790> than<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.210> sand<00:00:39.480> wedge<00:00:39.829> particularly

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
other than your sand wedge particularly

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.340 
other than your sand wedge particularly
a<00:00:41.190> lob<00:00:41.730> wedge<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> pitching<00:00:42.960> wedge<00:00:42.989> would

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
a lob wedge or a pitching wedge would

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
a lob wedge or a pitching wedge would
work<00:00:43.530> well<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> situation<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.390> other

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
work well in this situation the other

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.819 
work well in this situation the other
thing<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> want<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.559> eliminate

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
thing that you want to do to eliminate

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.770 
thing that you want to do to eliminate
any<00:00:47.219> bounce<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> make<00:00:48.120> sure<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.570> lead

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
any bounce is to make sure that the lead

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.400 
any bounce is to make sure that the lead
edge<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.230> club<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.430> its<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:50.670> down<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
edge of your club is on its way down and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.150 
edge of your club is on its way down and
strikes<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> sand<00:00:53.039> before<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.670> ball<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
strikes the sand before the ball and you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
strikes the sand before the ball and you
want<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> make<00:00:56.489> sure<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.329> steep

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
want to make sure that it's a very steep

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
want to make sure that it's a very steep
swing<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.620> digs<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> sand<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
swing so that it digs into the sand a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
swing so that it digs into the sand a
small<00:00:59.969> amount<00:01:00.270> i'm<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> set<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
small amount i'm going to set up and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.789 
small amount i'm going to set up and
give<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.800> example<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:03.739> i'm<00:01:04.739> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
give you an example of that i'm not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.170 
give you an example of that i'm not
going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> follow<00:01:05.369> through<00:01:05.700> very<00:01:05.970> much

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
going to follow through very much

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
going to follow through very much
because<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.110> motion<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
because more of my motion is going to be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.350 
because more of my motion is going to be
digging<00:01:08.280> into<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360 

and<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.050> helps<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.410> ball<00:01:19.590> come<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.040> nice

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
and that helps the ball come out nice

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.030 
and that helps the ball come out nice
and<00:01:20.430> high<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.120> also<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.320> other<00:01:22.410> trick<00:01:22.740> there

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and high and also the other trick there

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
and high and also the other trick there
is<00:01:23.250> most<00:01:24.120> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> time<00:01:24.360> you'll<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.810> faced<00:01:25.170> with

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
is most of the time you'll be faced with

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
is most of the time you'll be faced with
a<00:01:25.440> bunker<00:01:25.770> shot<00:01:25.980> in<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.250> you'll<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.550> trying

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a bunker shot in which you'll be trying

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.290 
a bunker shot in which you'll be trying
to<00:01:26.940> open<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.300> club<00:01:27.630> face<00:01:27.870> and<00:01:28.490> swing<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.520> an

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
to open your club face and swing with an

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.270 
to open your club face and swing with an
outside<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.960> end<00:01:31.110> swing<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.680> lots<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.010> bounce

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
outside to end swing with lots of bounce

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
outside to end swing with lots of bounce
in<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:32.700> case<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.870> wouldn't<00:01:34.140> work<00:01:34.230> so<00:01:34.290> well

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
in that case that wouldn't work so well

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.070 
in that case that wouldn't work so well
without<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> sands<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
without a lot of sands so when you're in

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.480 
without a lot of sands so when you're in
a<00:01:37.170> situation<00:01:37.410> where<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> ground<00:01:38.190> is<00:01:38.400> very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a situation where the ground is very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700 
a situation where the ground is very
firm<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.050> sure<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.560> all

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
firm you want to make sure you take all

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
firm you want to make sure you take all
the<00:01:40.890> bounce<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.550> your<00:01:41.670> shot<00:01:42.110> by<00:01:43.110> setting

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the bounce out of your shot by setting

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
the bounce out of your shot by setting
up<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.040> lead<00:01:44.310> edge<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.760> club<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
up so that the lead edge of the club is
