first getting it off and then playing
with<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> mechanism<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:26.460> right

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
with the mechanism here there all right

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
with the mechanism here there all right
so<00:00:26.820> here's<00:00:27.060> our<00:00:27.210> glovebox<00:00:27.920> now<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.039> going

bolts out we're going to go ahead and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
bolts out we're going to go ahead and
reach<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> glovebox<00:00:53.780> should

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
reach down here on the glovebox should

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.869 
reach down here on the glovebox should
come<00:00:55.020> out<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.309> held<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.670> by<00:00:56.820> the

come out and look just be held on by the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.270 
come out and look just be held on by the
latch<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.600> we're<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> reach<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.039> like

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
latch then we're going to reach up like

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
latch then we're going to reach up like
this<00:00:59.579> it's<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.690> difficult

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this it's going to be really difficult

latch feel around for a black plastic

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
latch feel around for a black plastic
piece<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.500> push<00:01:10.799> down<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:22.189> yeah<00:01:23.189> push<00:01:23.460> it

here and what it looks like is that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.100 
here and what it looks like is that
right<00:01:43.380> inside<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.659> goes<00:01:45.869> down

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
right inside here when this goes down

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
right inside here when this goes down
right<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.369> both

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
right there you can see that this both

right there you can see that this both
actually<00:01:51.210> stay<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.720> there's<00:01:51.930> supposed<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
actually stay there there's supposed to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.550 
actually stay there there's supposed to
be<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.439> latch<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.420> little<00:01:54.420> plastic<00:01:54.869> piece<00:01:55.259> so

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
be a latch a little plastic piece so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.630 
be a latch a little plastic piece so
that<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.159> lift<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> latch<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
that when you lift up on the latch it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.999 
that when you lift up on the latch it
pushes<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.790> down<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.810> looks<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.320> right<00:02:01.740> in

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
pushes this down but looks like right in

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
pushes this down but looks like right in
there<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:02.759> thing<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.090> keeps<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
there that little thing that keeps it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.690 
there that little thing that keeps it
down<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:04.560> pushes<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
down and then pushes it down when the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.779 
down and then pushes it down when the
latch<00:02:05.850> opens<00:02:06.299> has<00:02:07.049> broken<00:02:07.409> off<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.429> we're

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
latch opens has broken off so now we're

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.750 
latch opens has broken off so now we're
just<00:02:09.170> pulling<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> latch<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.580> not

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
just pulling on the latch and it's not

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
just pulling on the latch and it's not
doing<00:02:12.120> anything

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
doing anything
