 Internet providers and the rest of 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 companies that operate in the network should 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.450
 access the data of each user to

 arguing that the legislation

 anonymous returned to the attack and in this 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.080
 opportunity it was the web of the 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.180
 Department of Justice of the USA 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.400
 filtering about 1.7 gigabytes of

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.480
 a series of emails 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.490
 inmates plus the entire database of the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.420
 statement justifying his action 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.280
 adding that the data was put to 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.710
 available to the public so that they 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.780
 evaluate their content is not clear 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.480
 still if there is something interesting in the

 set of e-mails and other data 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.900
 the torrents close this month of 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.340
 June there was an attack on the part of the us 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.470
 they managed to close all the torrents 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.810
 download for a while the downloads 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.090
 through torrents did not work all the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.660
 what downloads at that moment was 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.490
 the discharge at 10% to 99% no longer 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.410
 it would work more until the teachers 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.320
 of the downloads go back up the 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.720

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.660
 they were available again 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.280
 until not approved in europe the

 majority the international agreement against

 your doubts about the effectiveness of

 Euro parliamentary committees have 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.610
 recommended to reject the agreement and that 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.350
 the European Commission has resorted to 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.360
 court of justice of the eu 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.550
