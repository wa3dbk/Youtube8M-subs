00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
difference in size as you can see that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.730 
difference in size as you can see that
this<00:01:42.060> one's<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.450> bigger<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> brighter<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
this one's a lot bigger and brighter and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
this one's a lot bigger and brighter and
it's<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.040> pretty<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.460> shiny<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.060> sparkly

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's really pretty and shiny and sparkly

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
it's really pretty and shiny and sparkly

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and they're actually really comfortable

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
and they're actually really comfortable
and<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.049> might<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.290> gotten<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> little

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and I think I might have gotten a little

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.429 
and I think I might have gotten a little
debris<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> my<00:01:50.909> eye<00:01:51.479> they're<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.259> pretty

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
debris in my eye they're really pretty

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.219 
debris in my eye they're really pretty
uncomfortable<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> wear<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.930> up

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
uncomfortable you can wear them for up

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.399 
uncomfortable you can wear them for up
to<00:01:56.070> about<00:01:56.340> eight<00:01:56.610> hours<00:01:57.079> some<00:01:58.079> people<00:01:58.110> say

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
to about eight hours some people say

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.420 
to about eight hours some people say
they're<00:01:58.560> dangerous<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.009> things<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.369> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
they're dangerous and things like that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 
they're dangerous and things like that

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.699 
natural and people look at your eyes and
they<00:03:40.970> think<00:03:41.360> there's<00:03:41.810> something<00:03:41.900> going<00:03:42.380> on

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
they think there's something going on

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.559 
they think there's something going on
with<00:03:42.769> those<00:03:43.190> eyes<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.850> something<00:03:44.150> about<00:03:44.269> those

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
with those eyes or something about those

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.120 
with those eyes or something about those
eyes<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:44.989> really<00:03:45.350> can't<00:03:45.620> figure<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.040> out

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
eyes and I really can't figure it out

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.790 
eyes and I really can't figure it out
now<00:03:46.940> if<00:03:47.180> they're<00:03:47.390> kind<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.720> brown<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.620> then

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
now if they're kind of brown and then

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.170 
now if they're kind of brown and then
they<00:03:48.890> see<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.130> color<00:03:49.310> then<00:03:49.730> they<00:03:49.819> figure<00:03:50.120> out

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
they see the color then they figure out

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.449 
they see the color then they figure out
that<00:03:50.330> you<00:03:50.450> have<00:03:50.569> on<00:03:50.690> contacts<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.860> um<00:03:52.250> I

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
that you have on contacts but um I

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.070 
that you have on contacts but um I
actually<00:03:52.640> think<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.150> really<00:03:53.390> prefer<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.720> black

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
actually think I really prefer the black

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.750 
actually think I really prefer the black
ones<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.680> brown<00:03:54.890> ones<00:03:55.069> are<00:03:55.190> very<00:03:55.250> very

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
ones but the brown ones are very very

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.330 
ones but the brown ones are very very
