 that the president saints wants to deny the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 public is weakened the rifirrafe that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.699
 through your account on twitter that the 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.560
 Governor of La Guajira Juan Francisco

 check news guajira plus the two 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 pump cylinders would aim 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.670
 houses of the governor and the mayor said 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 statement sparked criticism of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 different sectors and even the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.820
 President Juan Manuel Santos referred 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 yesterday Friday to the statements given 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 by the former president and denied the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.300
 attack to gÃ³mez arguing that uribe 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.170
 wants to poison the peace process this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.089
 morning 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.370
 and I have to say it with the name 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.939
 own because he was the one who answered the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.590
 president uribe in what yes he had to 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.790
 if there had been an attack 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.130
 against the governor of the guajira 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.049
 the head of state used the agreement 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.020
 for prosperity for the first time 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.939
 give him publicly-uribe was in that 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.920
 moment when he asked the governor of 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.310
 the guajira that denied said 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.950
 denunciations rescue two pimpinas of 45 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.720
 pounds that had shrapnel and lass like 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.420
 you said the detonated 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.620
 control me controllably in that 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.380
 I was in the municipality 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.300
 from maicao I have not been evacuated the funny thing 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.400
 is that while publicly endorsing 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.410
 to saints denying the attack in several 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.720
 local broadcasters ended up giving it the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.390
 uribe reason confirming that if there was 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.730
 bombings all life is not investigated 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.090
 Really 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.140
 the situation the alliances those that are 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.180
 dangerous because 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.670
 The fact is that it has not yet been 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.250
 determined who was the author 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.450
 intellectual of the attack today the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.460
 former president uribe and the president 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.460
 saints ratified their position
