00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
reason I did that the only reason I did

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040 
reason I did that the only reason I did
that<00:02:43.709> because<00:02:44.540> Canon<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> only<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:45.989> that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
that because Canon is the only one that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.750 
that because Canon is the only one that
puts<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:47.930> felt<00:02:48.930> type<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.620> material<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
puts this felt type of material on the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.790 
puts this felt type of material on the
inside<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.330> catch<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:52.020> know<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.260> catches<00:02:52.530> that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
inside to catch you know it catches that

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.060 
inside to catch you know it catches that
light<00:02:53.070> really<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.470> any<00:02:55.470> stray<00:02:55.890> light

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
light really good so any stray light

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.830
