the final stages to keep everything
together<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.489> take<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> lighted<00:01:03.239> finish

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
together and take the lighted finish

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.679 
together and take the lighted finish
gotcha<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> stage<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> pasadena<00:01:06.270> is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
gotcha is the stage in the pasadena is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.149 
gotcha is the stage in the pasadena is
that<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.290> climbing<00:01:07.740> than<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> river

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that a lot more climbing than the river

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
that a lot more climbing than the river
was<00:01:08.280> keyboard<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:09.119> certainly<00:01:09.510> certainly

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
was keyboard well certainly certainly

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
was keyboard well certainly certainly
they<00:01:10.530> changed<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.580> haven't<00:01:11.790> seen

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
they changed it up a bit I haven't seen

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.280 
they changed it up a bit I haven't seen
the<00:01:12.119> circuit<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.900> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> comment

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the circuit so I don't want to comment

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.780 
the circuit so I don't want to comment
on<00:01:13.590> yeah<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> circuits

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
on yeah I don't know if the circuits

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
on yeah I don't know if the circuits
gonna<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.180> hard<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> didn't<00:01:16.350> see

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
gonna be really hard or not I didn't see

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.310 
gonna be really hard or not I didn't see
the<00:01:16.530> profile<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.009> course<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.580> profiles

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
the profile of course but profiles

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.510 
the profile of course but profiles
sometimes<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> profiles<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
sometimes you see a profiles got a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
sometimes you see a profiles got a
little<00:01:20.610> bump<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.930> realize

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
little bump like this and you realize

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
little bump like this and you realize
there's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> wall<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:24.330> times

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
there's a wall like that but other times

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.929 
there's a wall like that but other times
it's<00:01:24.750> reversed<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.430> pretty<00:01:26.729> hard<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it's reversed so it's pretty hard to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's reversed so it's pretty hard to
tell<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> profile<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.259> without

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
tell from the profile but without

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
tell from the profile but without
hearing<00:01:29.430> anything<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.939> looks<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
hearing anything it looks like it's a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.359 
hearing anything it looks like it's a
pretty<00:01:30.600> hard<00:01:30.869> stage<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> big

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
pretty hard stage if you go up the big

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.710 
pretty hard stage if you go up the big
climb<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.759> getting<00:01:32.909> drop<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> then

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
climb you're getting drop down and then

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.120 
climb you're getting drop down and then
and<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> circuits

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and you're going to have the circuits

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
and you're going to have the circuits
with<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> fine<00:01:35.729> line<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> may<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.509> pretty

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
with a fine line so that may be pretty

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
with a fine line so that may be pretty
exciting<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.290> might<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.439> some<00:01:37.829> action<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
exciting there might be some action that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.280 
exciting there might be some action that
could<00:01:39.150> affect<00:01:39.450> something<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.259> that

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
year so we're talking about six years

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.120 
year so we're talking about six years
now<00:04:13.780> yeah<00:04:15.299> they<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.570> tell<00:04:17.350> us<00:04:17.500> what<00:04:17.680> benefits

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
now yeah they can tell us what benefits

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.920 
now yeah they can tell us what benefits
you<00:04:18.250> see<00:04:18.519> when<00:04:18.760> you're<00:04:18.880> taking<00:04:19.000> oxygen<00:04:19.630> versus

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
you see when you're taking oxygen versus

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.879 
you see when you're taking oxygen versus
not<00:04:20.079> taking<00:04:20.410> out<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.680> do<00:04:20.799> um<00:04:22.229> well<00:04:23.229> if<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.800> know

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
not taking out to do um well if you know

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.279 
not taking out to do um well if you know
I've<00:04:24.010> always<00:04:24.099> taken<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:25.030> it's<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:26.110> kind

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
I've always taken it so it's it's kind

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.500 
I've always taken it so it's it's kind
of<00:04:26.320> hard<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.880> distinguish<00:04:27.880> between<00:04:28.120> taking

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
of hard to distinguish between taking

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.089 
of hard to distinguish between taking
and<00:04:28.780> not<00:04:28.810> but<00:04:29.260> there's<00:04:29.410> certainly<00:04:29.740> been<00:04:29.830> times

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
and not but there's certainly been times

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.820 
and not but there's certainly been times
when<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.310> haven't<00:04:30.729> and<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:31.169> sort<00:04:32.169> of<00:04:32.260> always<00:04:32.440> kind

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
when I haven't and I sort of always kind

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.409 
when I haven't and I sort of always kind
of<00:04:32.919> for<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> important<00:04:33.849> races<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.389> know

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
of for the important races you know

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.680 
of for the important races you know
started<00:04:35.260> taking<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:36.280> few<00:04:36.849> months<00:04:37.000> out<00:04:37.270> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
started taking it a few months out and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.659 
started taking it a few months out and
through<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.289> race<00:04:38.470> obviously<00:04:39.099> so<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.430> kind<00:04:39.639> of

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.960 
through the race obviously so it kind of
coincides<00:04:40.210> with<00:04:40.330> my<00:04:40.510> form<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:42.520> know<00:04:42.639> it's

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
coincides with my form but you know it's

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.779 
coincides with my form but you know it's
always<00:04:43.150> been<00:04:43.479> reliable<00:04:44.380> for<00:04:44.860> me<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.250> feel

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.810 
always been reliable for me and I feel
like<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.150> allows<00:04:46.479> me<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.889> recover<00:04:48.490> day

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
like it allows me to to recover day

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.839 
like it allows me to to recover day
after<00:04:48.970> day<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.510> handle<00:04:49.930> more<00:04:50.050> stress

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
after day and handle more stress

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.670 
after day and handle more stress

in<00:05:00.909> formula<00:05:01.300> well<00:05:02.199> you<00:05:02.349> know<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.560> see<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:03.130> know

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
in formula well you know to see you know

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.510 
in formula well you know to see you know
you<00:05:03.280> take<00:05:03.520> less<00:05:03.789> dosage<00:05:04.270> that's<00:05:04.659> always<00:05:04.840> nice

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
you take less dosage that's always nice

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.310 
you take less dosage that's always nice
not<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.699> take<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.120> loading<00:05:07.659> phase<00:05:07.690> right

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
not to take to the loading phase right

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.879 
not to take to the loading phase right
but<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:10.590> think<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:12.550> know<00:05:12.699> I<00:05:12.970> think<00:05:13.659> it's

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
but I think that you know I think it's

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.649 
but I think that you know I think it's
as<00:05:14.889> good<00:05:15.220> as<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.580> original<00:05:15.610> oxygen<00:05:16.419> are

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
as good as the original oxygen are

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.500 
as good as the original oxygen are
probably<00:05:16.960> better<00:05:17.289> if<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.560> don't<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.360> know

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
probably better if you don't and I know

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.000 
probably better if you don't and I know
you've<00:05:19.690> been<00:05:19.720> taking<00:05:20.139> pre<00:05:20.380> race<00:05:20.530> now<00:05:20.770> for

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
you've been taking pre race now for

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.860 
you've been taking pre race now for
quite<00:05:21.159> a<00:05:21.220> while<00:05:21.400> are<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.360> planning<00:05:22.539> on<00:05:22.720> using

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
quite a while are you planning on using

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.719 
quite a while are you planning on using
pre<00:05:23.229> race<00:05:23.380> for<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.740> time<00:05:23.950> trial<00:05:24.190> in<00:05:24.310> Solvang

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
pre race for the time trial in Solvang

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.420 
pre race for the time trial in Solvang
and<00:05:25.000> right<00:05:25.409> yeah<00:05:26.409> not<00:05:26.860> actually<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.370> don't

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
and right yeah not actually I don't

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.310 
and right yeah not actually I don't
drink<00:05:27.639> coffee

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
drink coffee

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.010 
drink coffee
never<00:05:28.560> really<00:05:28.860> got<00:05:29.070> into<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.640> then<00:05:29.880> I<00:05:30.150> kind

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
never really got into it and then I kind

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.620 
never really got into it and then I kind
of<00:05:31.080> found<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.710> was<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.830> benefit<00:05:32.340> because

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
of found that it was a benefit because

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.900 
of found that it was a benefit because
at<00:05:33.630> times<00:05:33.870> if<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.260> do<00:05:34.320> take<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> pre-race<00:05:35.700> for

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
at times if I do take a pre-race for

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.180 
at times if I do take a pre-race for
example<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.420> really<00:05:36.810> feel<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.230> is<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.650> huge<00:05:37.950> boost

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
example I really feel it is a huge boost

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.060 
example I really feel it is a huge boost
and<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:39.570> find<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.260> know<00:05:40.380> even<00:05:40.530> half<00:05:40.950> a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
and I find that you know even half a

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.370 
and I find that you know even half a
scoop<00:05:41.280> is<00:05:41.430> enough<00:05:41.700> for<00:05:41.730> me<00:05:41.990> so<00:05:42.990> yeah<00:05:43.350> I

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
scoop is enough for me so yeah I

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.650 
scoop is enough for me so yeah I
definitely<00:05:43.500> feel<00:05:44.040> like<00:05:44.220> yeah<00:05:44.550> yeah<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.600> I

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
definitely feel like yeah yeah and I

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.730 
definitely feel like yeah yeah and I
think<00:05:45.720> it<00:05:45.960> lasts<00:05:46.230> for<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.410> while<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.710> know

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
think it lasts for a while you know

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.040 
think it lasts for a while you know
taking<00:05:47.730> it<00:05:47.910> in<00:05:47.970> training<00:05:48.330> done<00:05:48.600> out<00:05:48.750> for<00:05:48.930> five

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
taking it in training done out for five

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.040 
taking it in training done out for five
hours<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.470> just<00:05:49.650> felt<00:05:50.340> like<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.810> was<00:05:51.810> flying

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
hours and just felt like I was flying

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.440 
hours and just felt like I was flying
for<00:05:52.380> five<00:05:52.560> hours<00:05:52.590> right<00:05:53.100> it<00:05:53.280> was<00:05:53.370> long<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.820> you

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
for five hours right it was long and you

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.320 
for five hours right it was long and you
use<00:05:54.600> it<00:05:54.630> at<00:05:54.840> any<00:05:55.020> road<00:05:55.320> races<00:05:55.970> you<00:05:56.970> just<00:05:57.180> stick

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
use it at any road races you just stick

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.690 
use it at any road races you just stick
with<00:05:57.480> contrails<00:05:58.020> ah<00:05:59.000> it<00:06:00.000> depends<00:06:00.390> I<00:06:00.540> you<00:06:01.230> know

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
with contrails ah it depends I you know

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.370 
with contrails ah it depends I you know
I've<00:06:02.700> been<00:06:03.000> trying<00:06:03.390> for<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:03.990> many<00:06:04.320> years

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
I've been trying for that many years

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.290 
I've been trying for that many years
obviously<00:06:05.070> starting<00:06:05.580> with<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.850> tour<00:06:06.030> last

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
obviously starting with the tour last

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.660 
obviously starting with the tour last
year<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.750> just<00:06:06.930> picking<00:06:07.890> the<00:06:08.010> time<00:06:08.250> trials

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
year and just picking the time trials

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.640 
year and just picking the time trials
because<00:06:08.850> I<00:06:09.480> didn't<00:06:10.050> have<00:06:10.170> that<00:06:10.290> much<00:06:10.440> time

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
because I didn't have that much time

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.320 
because I didn't have that much time
experiment<00:06:11.250> around<00:06:11.310> but<00:06:11.910> like<00:06:12.000> I<00:06:12.120> said<00:06:12.180> a

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
experiment around but like I said a

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.170 
experiment around but like I said a
training<00:06:12.780> I<00:06:12.840> tried<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.260> I<00:06:13.640> didn't<00:06:14.640> feel<00:06:14.850> like<00:06:14.910> I

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
training I tried it I didn't feel like I

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.750 
training I tried it I didn't feel like I
came<00:06:16.080> off<00:06:16.260> of<00:06:16.290> it<00:06:16.560> after<00:06:16.860> three<00:06:17.040> hours<00:06:17.130> and

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
came off of it after three hours and

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.910 
came off of it after three hours and
after<00:06:18.300> five<00:06:18.630> hours<00:06:18.660> is<00:06:19.050> still<00:06:19.290> felt<00:06:19.650> like<00:06:19.800> I

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
after five hours is still felt like I

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.600 
after five hours is still felt like I
was<00:06:20.040> going<00:06:20.250> so<00:06:20.700> i<00:06:21.290> think<00:06:22.290> it's<00:06:22.500> a<00:06:22.740> different

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
was going so i think it's a different

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.600 
was going so i think it's a different
viable<00:06:24.000> for<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.270> long<00:06:24.420> rotors<00:06:24.890> and<00:06:25.890> plans<00:06:26.400> for

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
viable for a long rotors and plans for

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.230 
viable for a long rotors and plans for
tomorrow<00:06:28.070> we<00:06:29.070> have<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.220> pay<00:06:29.490> attention<00:06:30.030> and

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
tomorrow we have to pay attention and

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.860 
tomorrow we have to pay attention and
really<00:06:31.080> be<00:06:31.200> concentrated<00:06:32.010> and<00:06:32.490> not<00:06:33.450> let<00:06:33.720> the

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
really be concentrated and not let the

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.990 
really be concentrated and not let the
race<00:06:33.990> get<00:06:34.200> away<00:06:34.380> from<00:06:34.440> us<00:06:34.740> and<00:06:34.980> then<00:06:35.160> we'll

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
race get away from us and then we'll

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.730 
race get away from us and then we'll
just<00:06:36.090> have<00:06:36.270> to<00:06:36.450> see<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:36.630> don't<00:06:36.990> think<00:06:37.260> that<00:06:37.320> I

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
just have to see I don't think that I

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.010 
just have to see I don't think that I
can<00:06:38.490> necessarily<00:06:39.000> force<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:39.810> situation

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
can necessarily force the situation

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.110 
can necessarily force the situation
because<00:06:40.830> it's<00:06:41.100> a<00:06:41.190> long<00:06:41.370> ways<00:06:41.580> from<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:41.850> top<00:06:42.090> of

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
because it's a long ways from the top of

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.080 
because it's a long ways from the top of

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
see our room to finish so if it works

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.180

out<00:06:45.270> it<00:06:45.330> works<00:06:45.450> out<00:06:45.750> but<00:06:46.020> can't<00:06:46.680> really<00:06:46.980> force

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
out it works out but can't really force

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.750 
out it works out but can't really force
it<00:06:48.200> you<00:06:49.200> know<00:06:49.620> that<00:06:49.770> time<00:06:49.980> trout<00:06:50.280> probably
