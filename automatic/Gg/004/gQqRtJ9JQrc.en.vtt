right<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> wall<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.990> wanted<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.410> your

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
right to a wall if you wanted to your

right to a wall if you wanted to your
backgrounds<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.279> always<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> same

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
backgrounds are always going at the same

height<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:33.480> whatever<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:33.870> matter<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
height or whatever doesn't matter you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.380

can<00:00:34.800> hook<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> wall<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> background

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
can hook them to a wall to a background

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.229 
can hook them to a wall to a background
stand<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.530> prefer<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> use<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> magnet<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
stand I prefer to use a magnet to a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
stand I prefer to use a magnet to a
magnet<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.140> stronger<00:00:40.379> than

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
magnet because it's a lot stronger than

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.889 
magnet because it's a lot stronger than
just<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> magnet<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.309> metal<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.510> double

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
just a magnet on metal it's got double

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
just a magnet on metal it's got double
double<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> attraction<00:00:43.920> power<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
double the attraction power and then I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660 
double the attraction power and then I
did<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.809> tape<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:47.129> non-slip

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
did take some of this tape it's non-slip

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.400 
did take some of this tape it's non-slip
tape<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.180> goes<00:00:48.300> underneath<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> rug

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
tape that goes underneath of like a rug

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
tape that goes underneath of like a rug
so<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.980> side<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.399> adhesive<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.000> other

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
so one side is an adhesive the other

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
so one side is an adhesive the other
side's<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.600> rubbery<00:00:51.989> surface<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
side's just like rubbery surface so I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.439 
side's just like rubbery surface so I
put<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> sticky<00:00:53.579> side<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.030> there

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
put the sticky side on there

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
put the sticky side on there
so<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.500> slippery<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
so that it's not slippery so the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
so that it's not slippery so the
background<00:00:56.489> wouldn't<00:00:56.879> slip<00:00:57.059> through<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
background wouldn't slip through and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
background wouldn't slip through and
then<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> magnets<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
then I just use a magnets and the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
then I just use a magnets and the
magnets<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:03.799> they're<00:01:04.799> called

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
magnets that I use they're called

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.130 
magnets that I use they're called
ceramic<00:01:05.489> magnets<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.060> super<00:01:06.450> strong<00:01:06.720> by<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
ceramic magnets are super strong by the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.390 
ceramic magnets are super strong by the
two<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.830> actually<00:01:08.130> put<00:01:08.280> them<00:01:08.340> like

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
two of them I can actually put them like

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800 
two of them I can actually put them like
through<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.790> hand<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> it'll<00:01:09.450> hold<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
through my hand and it'll hold it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
through my hand and it'll hold it
together<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.890> these<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.189> Lowe's<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.760> like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
together I get these at Lowe's it's like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
together I get these at Lowe's it's like
two<00:01:12.060> dollars<00:01:12.210> or<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
two dollars or something like that for a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.609 
two dollars or something like that for a
couple<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> package<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.350> type

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
couple of them in a package but the type

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.960 
couple of them in a package but the type
of<00:01:16.650> material<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.759> almost<00:01:17.850> like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of material that it is it's almost like

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.510 
of material that it is it's almost like
a<00:01:18.090> graphite<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.259> sort<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> write<00:01:20.310> on

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
a graphite and it can sort of write on

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.800 
a graphite and it can sort of write on
your<00:01:20.640> background<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
your background a little bit so I just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
your background a little bit so I just
take<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> piece<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.470> shirt<00:01:22.619> tape<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:23.009> duct

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
take like a piece of shirt tape or duct

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.460 
take like a piece of shirt tape or duct
tape<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.610> whatever<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.290> wrap<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
tape or whatever and then just wrap that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.499 
tape or whatever and then just wrap that
as<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.310> protective<00:01:26.850> coating<00:01:27.060> around<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
as a protective coating around the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170 
as a protective coating around the
magnet<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.430> wrap<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
magnet so I just wrap it up like that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
magnet so I just wrap it up like that
it's<00:01:30.780> got<00:01:30.930> some<00:01:31.079> little<00:01:31.350> present<00:01:31.680> looking

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's got some little present looking

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's got some little present looking
thing<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:35.369> doesn't<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.850> pretty<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
thing it doesn't have to be pretty it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
thing it doesn't have to be pretty it
doesn't<00:01:36.509> matter<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.229> protecting<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
doesn't matter I'm just protecting it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.020 
doesn't matter I'm just protecting it
from<00:01:38.630> marking<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.880> would

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
from marking on there and then I would

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.160 
from marking on there and then I would
just<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> felt<00:01:43.049> my

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
just use that so then when I felt my

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.499 
just use that so then when I felt my
background<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.680> pulled<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> magnet<00:01:44.220> off

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
background I just pulled the magnet off

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.520 
background I just pulled the magnet off
you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.630> stick<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> background<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.380> and

throw magnet on it and they're really
strong<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.079> pull<00:01:49.259> tight<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.930> can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
strong you can pull tight on it you can

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.240 
strong you can pull tight on it you can
throw<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.229> couple<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.560> Honor<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.920> want<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> I

one<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> middle<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.689> have

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
one in the middle but you don't have

one in the middle but you don't have
that<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.710> each<00:01:58.799> end

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that you could just do one on each end

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.260 
that you could just do one on each end
this<00:01:59.340> type<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> magnet<00:02:00.000> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this type of magnet is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
this type of magnet is
be<00:02:00.359> strong<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> great<00:02:01.590> way<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.130> mount

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
be strong so that's a great way to mount

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.880 
be strong so that's a great way to mount
that<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> roller<00:02:04.259> system<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.859> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that I have that on a roller system so I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.940 
that I have that on a roller system so I
can<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.429> know<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.299> button

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.500 

raise<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:15.739> got<00:02:16.739> into<00:02:16.920> different<00:02:17.510> different

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
raise I got into different different

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
raise I got into different different
widths<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.840> there<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.019> actually<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.440> four<00:02:19.709> of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
widths on there I actually have four of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.890 
widths on there I actually have four of
them<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.370> bar<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.629> can<00:02:21.810> do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
them on that one bar so that I can do

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.630 
them on that one bar so that I can do
all<00:02:22.019> my<00:02:22.170> different<00:02:22.349> sizes<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.310> then

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
all my different sizes on there and then

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.619 
all my different sizes on there and then
the<00:02:23.730> height<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.060> adjust<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> can

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
the height I can adjust but you can

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.390 
the height I can adjust but you can
mount<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.080> said<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.410> existing<00:02:26.160> wall

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
mount it like I said to a existing wall

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.380 
mount it like I said to a existing wall
a<00:02:27.560> little<00:02:28.560> closer<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.209> really

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
a little closer on that so it's really

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.259 
a little closer on that so it's really
easy

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
easy

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.339

there's no tape sticking it's not sticky

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.870 
there's no tape sticking it's not sticky
at<00:03:56.510> all<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.890> basically<00:03:58.250> I'm<00:03:58.490> making<00:03:58.520> just

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880

at all and so basically I'm making just
a<00:03:58.970> little<00:03:59.180> -<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.660> little<00:03:59.810> sleeve<00:04:00.290> then<00:04:00.560> put<00:04:01.040> on

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
a little - a little sleeve then put on

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.130 
a little - a little sleeve then put on
there<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.270> then<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.840> get<00:04:03.020> the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
there and then just you get the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.630 
there and then just you get the
background<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.590> make<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.980> size<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.610> needs

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
background you make it the size it needs

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.160 
background you make it the size it needs
to<00:04:05.000> be<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.480> then<00:04:06.140> just<00:04:06.170> take<00:04:06.620> your<00:04:06.770> napkin

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
to be and then just take your napkin

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.620 
to be and then just take your napkin
background<00:04:09.190> if<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.220> just<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.910> size<00:04:11.150> I'm<00:04:11.390> just

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
background if you just the size I'm just

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.390 
background if you just the size I'm just
spinning<00:04:11.810> around<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.260> snug<00:04:12.740> up<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.070> there<00:04:13.250> and

spinning around and snug up on there and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.710 
spinning around and snug up on there and
then<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:13.820> way<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.270> just<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.510> know<00:04:14.540> you

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
then that way you can just you know you

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.930 
then that way you can just you know you

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
together and you can store it nice I

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.930 
together and you can store it nice I
have<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.980> image<00:04:19.220> on<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.430> outside<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:19.910> can

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
have the image on the outside so I can

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.270 
have the image on the outside so I can
see<00:04:20.239> what<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.510> is<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.140> then<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.650> just<00:04:21.830> I<00:04:22.040> store

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
see what it is and then I just I store

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.920 
see what it is and then I just I store
them<00:04:22.460> vertically<00:04:23.470> cinema

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:41.409 

I<00:04:37.690> also<00:04:38.690> store<00:04:39.050> my<00:04:39.290> smaller<00:04:40.270> textile<00:04:41.270> these

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
I also store my smaller textile these

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.570 
I also store my smaller textile these
are<00:04:41.510> all<00:04:41.600> textile<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.050> I'm<00:04:42.199> doing<00:04:42.320> that<00:04:42.470> with

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
are all textile that I'm doing that with

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.710 
are all textile that I'm doing that with
same<00:04:43.580> thing<00:04:43.760> I've<00:04:43.880> made<00:04:44.090> it's<00:04:44.300> just<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.479> smaller

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
same thing I've made it's just a smaller

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.129 
same thing I've made it's just a smaller
version<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:46.160> these<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.430> cut<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:47.139> skinny

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
version of it and these I cut the skinny

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.080 
version of it and these I cut the skinny
way<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:48.740> it's<00:04:48.919> a<00:04:51.669> it<00:04:52.669> was<00:04:52.790> eight<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.060> half

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
way so it's a it was eight and a half

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.520 
way so it's a it was eight and a half
some<00:04:53.330> smaller<00:04:53.600> it's<00:04:53.930> not<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.199> eleven

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
some smaller it's not the eleven

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.260 
some smaller it's not the eleven
eight-and-a-half<00:04:55.430> then<00:04:55.699> doubled<00:04:56.030> over<00:04:56.240> in

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
eight-and-a-half then doubled over in

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.400 
eight-and-a-half then doubled over in
its<00:04:56.389> overlap<00:04:56.810> about<00:04:56.930> an<00:04:57.080> inch<00:04:57.260> that's

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
its overlap about an inch that's

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.010 
its overlap about an inch that's
probably<00:04:57.830> about<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.630> whole<00:04:59.630> overall

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
probably about a whole overall

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.540 
probably about a whole overall
circumference<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.919> than<00:05:01.039> like<00:05:01.190> seven

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
circumference on it than like seven

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.770 
circumference on it than like seven
inches<00:05:01.760> something<00:05:02.030> like<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.600> then<00:05:02.720> I

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
inches something like that and then I

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.379 
inches something like that and then I
just<00:05:02.900> roll<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.169> background<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.710> up

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
just roll the background it up

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.370 
just roll the background it up
it's<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.570> textile<00:05:05.990> thing<00:05:06.139> I<00:05:06.169> worry<00:05:06.350> about

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
it's the textile thing I worry about

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.170 
it's the textile thing I worry about
losing<00:05:06.650> in<00:05:06.860> shape<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.400> then<00:05:07.820> just<00:05:07.970> grab<00:05:08.150> a

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
losing in shape and then just grab a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.210 
losing in shape and then just grab a
building<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.660> small<00:05:08.960> like<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.169> put<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:09.979> ring

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
building a small like that put the ring

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.770 
building a small like that put the ring
on<00:05:10.370> it<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.699> it's<00:05:10.820> a<00:05:10.910> little<00:05:11.030> big<00:05:11.300> but<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:11.660> goes

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
on it and it's a little big but it goes

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.779 
on it and it's a little big but it goes
they'll<00:05:12.380> tighten<00:05:12.710> up<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:12.919> there<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.639> then

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
they'll tighten up on there and then

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.090 
they'll tighten up on there and then
that<00:05:13.910> way<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.090> can<00:05:14.270> store<00:05:14.479> my<00:05:14.630> textiles<00:05:15.260> the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
that way I can store my textiles the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.590 
that way I can store my textiles the
same<00:05:16.340> way<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.760> use<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.180> put<00:05:17.330> it<00:05:17.419> in<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
same way I use I just put it in the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.210 
same way I use I just put it in the
middle<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.050> then<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.350> still<00:05:18.560> storm<00:05:18.800> Berkeley

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
middle and then I still storm Berkeley

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.219 
middle and then I still storm Berkeley
so<00:05:19.699> it's<00:05:20.030> easier<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.419> do<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.750> pick<00:05:20.930> up<00:05:20.960> less

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
so it's easier to do that pick up less

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.860 
so it's easier to do that pick up less
space<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.860> do<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:22.880> with<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.090> image<00:05:23.240> side<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:23.780> the

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
space I do it with the image side to the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.689 
space I do it with the image side to the
outside<00:05:24.229> so<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.560> can<00:05:24.620> see<00:05:24.949> what<00:05:25.100> it<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.220> quickly

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
outside so I can see what it is quickly

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:35.500 
outside so I can see what it is quickly
and<00:05:25.940> grab<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:33.729> we're<00:05:34.729> gonna<00:05:34.880> muck<00:05:35.090> was<00:05:35.210> really

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
and grab it we're gonna muck was really

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.260 
and grab it we're gonna muck was really
easy<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:36.260> just<00:05:37.130> roll<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:37.700> out<00:05:37.789> across<00:05:37.880> the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
easy to I just roll it out across the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.140 
easy to I just roll it out across the
floor<00:05:41.979> time<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.070> put<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.580> come<00:05:43.789> back<00:05:43.970> here

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
floor time to put and come back here

00:05:44.150 --> 00:06:16.320 
floor time to put and come back here
again

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.970 

well<00:06:17.330> it's<00:06:17.480> not<00:06:19.450> how<00:06:20.450> you<00:06:20.510> want<00:06:20.750> to<00:06:20.780> do<00:06:20.930> it<00:06:21.080> if

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
well it's not how you want to do it if

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.760 
well it's not how you want to do it if
you<00:06:22.190> wanted<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.580> throw<00:06:22.790> another<00:06:23.030> one<00:06:23.120> in<00:06:23.270> there

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
you wanted to throw another one in there

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.840 
you wanted to throw another one in there
towards<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.830> middle<00:06:25.100> army<00:06:25.400> want<00:06:25.550> to<00:06:25.610> do<00:06:25.700> it

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
towards the middle army want to do it

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.180 
towards the middle army want to do it
you<00:06:26.600> don't<00:06:26.720> need<00:06:26.840> it<00:06:26.960> though

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.410 

and<00:06:31.190> this<00:06:31.430> is<00:06:31.520> why<00:06:31.610> I<00:06:31.670> like<00:06:31.850> going<00:06:32.030> on<00:06:32.300> the

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
and this is why I like going on the

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:52.900 
and this is why I like going on the
roller<00:06:32.570> I<00:06:41.710> can<00:06:42.710> bring<00:06:42.920> it<00:06:43.070> up<00:06:43.100> by<00:06:43.160> side<00:06:51.760> if<00:06:52.760> you

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
roller I can bring it up by side if you

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.430 
roller I can bring it up by side if you
had<00:06:53.060> a<00:06:53.090> cricket<00:06:53.510> or<00:06:53.600> something<00:06:53.930> you<00:06:54.110> just<00:06:54.230> pull
