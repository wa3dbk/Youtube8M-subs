okay<00:00:01.469> what<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:01.800> doing<00:00:02.190> here<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.460> we're

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay what we're doing here is we're

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.400 
okay what we're doing here is we're
going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.090> measure<00:00:03.589> the<00:00:04.640> length<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
going to measure the length of the

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.580 
going to measure the length of the
lifters<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.649> not<00:00:08.519> from<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.570> roller<00:00:10.050> tip<00:00:10.380> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
lifters and not from the roller tip to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490 
lifters and not from the roller tip to
the<00:00:10.679> body<00:00:10.889> itself<00:00:11.840> we<00:00:12.840> want<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.110> measure<00:00:13.259> it

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the body itself we want to measure it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.970 
the body itself we want to measure it
from<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> roller<00:00:14.070> tip<00:00:14.839> to<00:00:15.839> down<00:00:16.260> into<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> cup

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
from the roller tip to down into the cup

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090 
from the roller tip to down into the cup
now<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.609> cannot<00:00:18.270> measure<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> end<00:00:19.770> here

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
now you cannot measure to the end here

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.120 
now you cannot measure to the end here
and<00:00:20.939> where<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.480> measure<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and where can you measure on like the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
and where can you measure on like the
face<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> cup<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.570> you'll<00:00:25.439> notice

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
face of the cup because if you'll notice

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.779 
face of the cup because if you'll notice
on<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.580> ls2<00:00:27.119> lifter<00:00:28.279> where<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.369> leads<00:00:29.550> down

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
on the ls2 lifter where it leads down

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.389 
on the ls2 lifter where it leads down
into<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> cup<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:30.929> beveled<00:00:31.500> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
into the cup it's actually beveled so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
into the cup it's actually beveled so
there's<00:00:32.880> no<00:00:33.030> way<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> good<00:00:33.660> accurate

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
there's no way to get a good accurate

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
there's no way to get a good accurate
measurement<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> method<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
measurement there so the method of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.319 
measurement there so the method of
measurement<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.719> I'm<00:00:36.899> using<00:00:37.110> involves<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
measurement that I'm using involves a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
measurement that I'm using involves a
comp<00:00:39.329> cams<00:00:39.890> push<00:00:40.890> rod<00:00:41.129> link<00:00:41.460> checker<00:00:41.760> that's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
comp cams push rod link checker that's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.750 
comp cams push rod link checker that's
been<00:00:42.329> disassembled<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> piece<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
been disassembled I just have a piece of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580 
been disassembled I just have a piece of
plastic<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.480> end<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.960> shimmed

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
plastic on the end there that's shimmed

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.229 
plastic on the end there that's shimmed
with<00:00:46.770> rubber<00:00:47.010> bands<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.489> help<00:00:47.670> hold<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
with rubber bands to help hold it in

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
with rubber bands to help hold it in
place<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.350> accurate

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
place so we can get a good accurate

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.360 
place so we can get a good accurate
measurement<00:00:50.430> every<00:00:50.579> time<00:00:52.219> we're<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
measurement every time we're going to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
measurement every time we're going to
start<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.600> ls2<00:00:55.050> lifters<00:00:55.469> go

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
start out with a the ls2 lifters go

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.170 
start out with a the ls2 lifters go
ahead<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.850> measure<00:00:57.030> we've<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.629> two<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.199> each

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
ahead and measure we've got two of each

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.930 
ahead and measure we've got two of each
with<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> help<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.809> lovely<00:01:00.890> assistant

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
with the help of my lovely assistant

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.570 
with the help of my lovely assistant
we're<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:04.010> take<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> left<00:01:05.309> arm<00:01:05.430> we're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we're going to take the left arm we're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.039 
we're going to take the left arm we're
going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.180> roller<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
going to put it with a roller to the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
going to put it with a roller to the
side<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> good<00:01:09.180> accurate

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
side so that I can get a good accurate

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740 
side so that I can get a good accurate
measurement<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:11.030> my<00:01:12.030> assistant<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
measurement on that and my assistant is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.609 
measurement on that and my assistant is
going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.350> hold<00:01:14.119> just<00:01:15.119> hold<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.810> length

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
going to hold just hold the length

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.160 
going to hold just hold the length
checker<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> end<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> cup<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
checker down the end of the cup and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
checker down the end of the cup and
that's<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> good

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that's it just that I can get a good

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.109 
that's it just that I can get a good
measurement<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.470> we're<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> measure

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
measurement on it we're going to measure

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
measurement on it we're going to measure
measure<00:01:24.119> each<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.479> three<00:01:24.990> times<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
measure each one three times just to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670 
measure each one three times just to
make<00:01:25.860> sure<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:28.350> doing<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
make sure that that we're doing it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
make sure that that we're doing it
accurately<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> consistent

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
accurately and we get a consistent

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590 
accurately and we get a consistent
reading<00:01:31.130> okay<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> looks<00:01:32.400> good<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> I'm

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
reading okay that looks good and I'm

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.990 
reading okay that looks good and I'm
going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.820> close<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.150> we'll<00:01:36.390> call<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
going to close this and we'll call that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.510 
going to close this and we'll call that
0.93<00:01:39.000> mm-hmm<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.619> won't<00:01:40.799> measure<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.310> same

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
0.93 mm-hmm we won't measure that same

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.380 
0.93 mm-hmm we won't measure that same
one<00:01:41.700> again<00:01:43.820> we'll<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> over<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> little

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
one again we'll move it over a little

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
one again we'll move it over a little
bit<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.290> way<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.430> go

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
bit that way there we go

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.889 
bit that way there we go
make<00:01:48.030> sure<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
make sure that we can see the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.310 
make sure that we can see the
measurement

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.260 

make<00:01:55.890> sure<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.160> hold<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.430> into<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.120> cup<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
make sure and hold it into the cup I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.600 
make sure and hold it into the cup I
thought<00:02:00.270> move<00:02:02.480> 0.93<00:02:03.950> do<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.040> again

point nine three we'll move on to the
first<00:02:43.220> ls7<00:02:44.000> liquor

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.780 

we<00:02:53.440> get<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.769> reading<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.159> 0.98

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.370 

Oh<00:03:00.879> point<00:03:01.450> nine<00:03:01.659> eight

and I bump the camera and a little
crooked<00:03:25.090> there<00:03:25.380> okay<00:03:26.380> perfect

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
crooked there okay perfect

point nine eight thank you
point<00:03:34.290> nine<00:03:34.470> eight

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.000 

point<00:03:39.670> nine<00:03:39.849> eight<00:03:39.879> I<00:03:40.510> think<00:03:41.349> we<00:03:41.620> can<00:03:41.769> conclude

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
point nine eight I think we can conclude

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.449 
point nine eight I think we can conclude
that<00:03:42.340> if<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.209> take<00:03:43.590> 0.98<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.120> subtract<00:03:47.459> 0.99

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
that if we take 0.98 and subtract 0.99

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.759 
that if we take 0.98 and subtract 0.99
three<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.540> would<00:03:49.689> we<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.319> we<00:03:50.439> would<00:03:50.590> get<00:03:50.709> a

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
three that would we that we would get a

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.369 
three that would we that we would get a
point<00:03:52.260> zero<00:03:53.260> five<00:03:54.719> difference<00:03:55.719> between<00:03:56.230> the

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
point zero five difference between the

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.750 
point zero five difference between the
LS<00:03:56.590> 2<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.010> LS<00:03:57.219> seven<00:03:57.569> thank<00:03:58.569> you
