a<00:04:01.430> split<00:04:01.760> decision<00:04:01.970> um<00:04:03.370> personally<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:05.030> know

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
a split decision um personally you know

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.089 
a split decision um personally you know
I<00:04:05.180> thought<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.959> could<00:04:06.019> either<00:04:06.410> been<00:04:06.739> a

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
I thought that it could either been a

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.740 
I thought that it could either been a
draw<00:04:08.060> or<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:09.019> could<00:04:09.230> been<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:10.420> decision<00:04:11.420> for

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
draw or it could been a decision for

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.140 
draw or it could been a decision for
Williams<00:04:12.200> my<00:04:13.069> car<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.610> decision<00:04:13.940> for

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
Williams my car is a decision for

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.990 
Williams my car is a decision for
Williams<00:04:14.720> but<00:04:15.380> it<00:04:15.500> could<00:04:15.739> be<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.950> drop<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.910> know

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
Williams but it could be a drop you know

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.659 
Williams but it could be a drop you know
that's<00:04:17.180> just<00:04:17.299> how<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.510> look<00:04:17.840> at<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.079> um<00:04:18.829> just

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
that's just how I look at it um just

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.219 
that's just how I look at it um just
faith<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.209> pretty<00:04:20.600> much<00:04:20.660> based<00:04:21.019> on

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
faith and pretty much based on

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.310 
faith and pretty much based on
countering<00:04:21.799> but<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.630> know<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.750> see<00:04:24.110> that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
countering but you know I see that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.620 
countering but you know I see that
leaves<00:04:24.560> only<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:26.000> know<00:04:26.090> was<00:04:26.240> starting<00:04:26.540> to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.390

little<00:05:12.080> bit<00:05:12.289> more<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.800> later<00:05:13.700> rounds<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.510> think

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
little bit more and later rounds I think

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.600 
little bit more and later rounds I think
in<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.440> later<00:05:15.740> rounds<00:05:15.770> Williams<00:05:16.400> would<00:05:16.580> have

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
in the later rounds Williams would have

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.120 
in the later rounds Williams would have
taken<00:05:16.970> advantage<00:05:17.570> of<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.780> but<00:05:18.530> overall<00:05:18.919> this

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
taken advantage of that but overall this

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.170 
taken advantage of that but overall this
warrants<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:19.700> rematch<00:05:20.150> um<00:05:21.580> this<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:22.789> my<00:05:22.820> opinion

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
warrants a rematch um this is my opinion

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.629 
warrants a rematch um this is my opinion
I<00:05:23.360> think<00:05:23.389> it<00:05:23.690> warrants<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.139> rematch<00:05:24.639> every

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
I think it warrants a rematch every

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.610 
I think it warrants a rematch every
everybody's<00:05:26.570> going<00:05:26.750> one<00:05:26.900> seemed<00:05:27.169> to<00:05:27.200> rematch

everybody's going one seemed to rematch
this<00:05:27.919> so<00:05:28.160> not<00:05:29.090> only<00:05:29.270> does<00:05:29.840> is<00:05:30.110> postponed<00:05:31.099> a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
this so not only does is postponed a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.430 
this so not only does is postponed a

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.490 
you know something that that I do
believe<00:05:46.350> though<00:05:46.740> is<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.070> think<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.600> Karma

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
believe though is I think that the Karma

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.170 
believe though is I think that the Karma
Cintron<00:05:49.980> being<00:05:50.250> carried<00:05:50.610> out<00:05:50.820> on<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:51.120> stretcher

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
if his injuries are serious and I think

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.410 
if his injuries are serious and I think
it's<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.350> little<00:05:55.530> too<00:05:55.680> much<00:05:56.810> you<00:05:57.810> know<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:59.420> at

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
it's a little too much you know and at

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.080 
it's a little too much you know and at
the<00:06:00.720> same<00:06:00.900> time<00:06:01.250> taking<00:06:02.250> consideration<00:06:02.550> that

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
the same time taking consideration that

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.850 
the same time taking consideration that
this<00:06:03.210> was<00:06:03.480> around<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:04.080> William<00:06:04.410> started<00:06:04.800> to

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
this was around that William started to

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.790 
this was around that William started to
really<00:06:05.040> pour<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.580> on<00:06:05.760> and<00:06:06.350> I<00:06:07.350> think<00:06:07.380> he<00:06:07.680> was

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
really pour it on and I think he was

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.120 
really pour it on and I think he was
starting<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.220> find<00:06:08.970> his<00:06:09.150> rhythm<00:06:09.390> and<00:06:09.690> find

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
starting to find his rhythm and find

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.680 
starting to find his rhythm and find
knowing<00:06:11.130> his<00:06:11.250> punches<00:06:11.640> we<00:06:11.790> were<00:06:12.270> starting<00:06:12.570> to

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
knowing his punches we were starting to

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.230 
knowing his punches we were starting to
you<00:06:13.110> know<00:06:13.170> fine<00:06:13.530> Cintron<00:06:14.130> from<00:06:14.400> from<00:06:15.090> all

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
you know fine Cintron from from all

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.190 
you know fine Cintron from from all
different<00:06:15.570> angles<00:06:16.130> but<00:06:17.130> overall<00:06:17.670> I<00:06:18.200> can't

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
different angles but overall I can't

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.720 
different angles but overall I can't
tell<00:06:19.380> you<00:06:19.470> whether<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.800> was<00:06:19.890> a<00:06:19.920> good<00:06:20.160> fight<00:06:20.400> not

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
tell you whether it was a good fight not

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.580 
tell you whether it was a good fight not
because<00:06:21.120> it<00:06:21.390> wasn't<00:06:21.750> necessarily<00:06:22.170> a<00:06:22.320> full

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
because it wasn't necessarily a full

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.510 
because it wasn't necessarily a full
complete<00:06:22.920> fight<00:06:23.340> there's<00:06:24.060> no<00:06:24.180> knockout<00:06:24.750> um

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
complete fight there's no knockout um

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.290 
complete fight there's no knockout um
and<00:06:26.520> if<00:06:27.210> I<00:06:27.360> just<00:06:27.660> wasn't<00:06:27.870> too<00:06:28.650> long<00:06:29.300> wasn't

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
and if I just wasn't too long wasn't

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.670 
and if I just wasn't too long wasn't
long<00:06:30.420> enough<00:06:30.660> to<00:06:30.810> determine<00:06:31.080> what<00:06:31.410> kind<00:06:31.650> of

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
long enough to determine what kind of

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.130 
long enough to determine what kind of
fight<00:06:31.920> we've<00:06:32.310> been<00:06:32.670> but<00:06:33.450> it<00:06:33.630> was<00:06:33.750> having<00:06:34.080> the

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
fight we've been but it was having the

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.250 
fight we've been but it was having the
makings<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:34.680> be<00:06:34.860> a<00:06:34.890> really<00:06:35.640> good<00:06:35.970> fight<00:06:36.300> as<00:06:36.570> it

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
makings to be a really good fight as it

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.710 
makings to be a really good fight as it
was<00:06:37.350> going<00:06:37.530> on<00:06:37.830> but<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:38.640> have<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:38.970> Williams<00:06:39.420> I
