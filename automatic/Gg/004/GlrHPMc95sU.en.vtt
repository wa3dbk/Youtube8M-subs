just remove these two bolts takes a
little<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.350> longer<00:01:59.060> but<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.330> much

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
little bit longer but it's just much

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:10.520 
little bit longer but it's just much
easier<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.289> filter<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.190> out
