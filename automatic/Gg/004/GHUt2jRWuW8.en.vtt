00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello how about we guys are in a video 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.790
 more of jacket being furniture today 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.720
 I bring you a tutorial on how to have 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.790
 minecraft 1.7 point 2 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.860
 with point xxi as we have it here 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.140
 so that it is not so annoying to have the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.410
 classic or hard- knit executable 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.290
 nothing like that and good today 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.700
 I bring you this this launcher is not going 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:32.470
 to do is download it 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.900
 here is download it from sorry 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.900
 good from here from this link 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.970
 Excuse me a moment 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.359
 we are going to go to this link that I am going to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.269
 leave in the description obviously good 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.269
 is this the only thing we are going to do is 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.940
 the only thing we do is what 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.630
 next we're going to open it and we're going to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630
 extract here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.340
 if they want they can delete it or they can 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.240
 save I will erase it because 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.240
 lie 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.550
 I'm going to keep it the only thing they're going to 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.080
 to do is as simple as that they will 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.270
 open 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 you are going to double click obviously or what 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 they will give options to execute as 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 administrator 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.180
 I'm going to ask permission to install 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.159
 they say yes and it's as easy as 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.320
 they're just going to have to put next 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.330
 next next select the language next 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.369
 next install and it's all only them 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.009
 ask I think I think 2 next and a 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.740
 install I 'm going to leave you an ex point 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.570
 identical to this one and a little boy to this one 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 all we 're going to do is open it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.260
 it is not expected to load a moment 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.520
 I do not know why that happened but good 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.440
 it is lengthening 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.890
 [Music] 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.740
 although he is right 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.150
 let's hope that the wta took a bit 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.150
 because I have already opened 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.060
 it does not matter what other things here 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.230
 I do not know why my mouse is blinking 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.030
 I do not have the remotest idea 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 I just hope that some problem 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.560
 of the new installation attempt 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.379
 let's wait a moment and ready 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.310
 It is open to our minecraft 1.7 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.310
 points 2 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.069
 with extra point so you do not have 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.740
 understand suffering as you see the launcher 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.540
 it's very, very easy and good 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.490
 here mine looks different because I have 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.680
 a textures package that's good as 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.830
 as if you want to be the ones I can be 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.260
 I can leave them in the description or 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.330
 better I'll be a tutorial more than 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.040
 how to have this texture so that it looks 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.260
 very well says that it does not respond well 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.459
 solve ten seconds surcharge 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.980
 It slows down mine because I'm 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.459
 recording but just just between 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.520
 about 10 seconds and ready this here is 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.069
 what he tells them and all in the great 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.650
 science is too fast 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.680
 and well, I think it's the installer 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.040
 easier than I know of minecraft's 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.049
 and well that's all for today good guys 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.340
 for now right now I'm going to 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.989
 do another tutorial of when I have in 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.659
 my textures package so that what 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.700
 they can see and taste good if they likes 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.889
 subscribe and I know how chile has a 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.909
 launcher for 1.7 but good one with 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.889
 point that I think it's going to be a 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.450
 little bit better and another thing is that it's 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.829
 completely upgradeable they no longer have 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.840
 to do nothing or is created at night 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.490
 or nothing will only open it and 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.530
 they will give the profile 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.410
 or create profile edit profile as 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.430
 you want and where is the sad 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.950
 version they will put this 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.380
 the most current version or the latest 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.930
 version used because you tell them is 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.000
 version 5 1.7 points 2 and above says 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.530
 another thing they give him there because it's already the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.020
 strength as soon as the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.460
 base update will update not 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.410
 I tried it but they told me there 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.720
 what if you can connect servers 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.000
 premium with this or that is a deception 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.539
 very very good and good I have not tried it 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.990
 but I guess so 7 power and good 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.900
 I'm also going to send him 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.090
 make a video of how to have a server and 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.370
 how to connect without hamachi and with hamas 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.630
 and ok all the tutorials that are left and 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.130
 the new things that they want then we 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.860
 can leave them in the description and I 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.300
 gladly I give ok that's good 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.300
 this has been all because of the video today is 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.000

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.740
