00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
One of the most important things to remember
about creating a birthing plan is that that

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
word is a very challenging word to use in
pregnancy and birth.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.360
The reality is I like to say how to create
your birth preferences.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.380
So in thinking about your preferences for
giving birth, it's important to do as much

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.500
reading and research as you can to consider
your options.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.120
The most important thing in creating a birthing
preference list or your birthing plan is to

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.070
know what your options are.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.680
So take a childbirth education class, talk
to your care provider, talk to your friends

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.140
and family, and create your list, your priority
list, of the most important things to you

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
for giving birth and to having the birth experience
that you would like to have.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.930
When you're creating your birth plan or your
birth preference list, pick the top three

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.110
most important items that are the most important
to you.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.829
Use these top three items to talk to your
care provider in the last few weeks of your

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.800
pregnancy at every prenatal visit that you
have.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.760
Print out your birth plan and your birth preference
list and bring this to the hospital or the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.920
birth center with you, or give it to your
midwife during your home birth.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.820
Make sure that your care providers and the
nurses and anyone else on your team know what

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.909
your choices are for your birth plan and your
birth preferences.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.830
Remember, always know what your options are,
so be sure to do as much reading and research

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.240
as you can, and remember to take a childbirth
education class.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.570
In creating your birth preferences or your
birth plan, think about your ideal birth experience.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.920
What does your ideal birth look like to you?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.280
Who's in the room with you?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.009
What kind of environment is around?

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.780
What music is playing?

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.250
Are there going to be photos taken or no photos
taken?

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.880
What are the top three most important things
to you?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.620
Do you want to have room to move, freedom
to move?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.149
Do you want to be able to eat and drink during
your labor?

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.369
Do you want to be able to avoid unnecessary
interventions?

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.860
Draw a picture of your ideal birth situation,
talk to your support team about your ideal

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.159
birth, and then using that picture of your
ideal birth, choose the top three most important

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.799
items to you.
