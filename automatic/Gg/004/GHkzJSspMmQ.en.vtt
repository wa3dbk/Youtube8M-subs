00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 the girls or the girls that I am 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.490
 snake yesterday we are here in a video 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.550
 Minecraft tutorial of course 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.250
 how to install the shaders the mod already 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.139
 know most people that 26 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 people and an effect that sees you 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.910
 minecraft not only as a cube but as well 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.859
 something better with shadows and a lot of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 things then I'm going to do a tutorial 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 how to install what would be 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.119
 download these three winrar that you see here 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 and where this would be the mod then 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.730
 I'm going to leave the four links here and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.469
 these here are going to have to make a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.410
 folder in your minecraft point folder 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.600
 what would be the percentage of app data 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.930
 percentage 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.969
 and they will go roaming and have it there goes 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.339
 to meet at a point minecraft in 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.079
 change I have it here on the desk 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.149
 I have three minecraft point folders like this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.190
 that does not have anything to do with you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.989
 talking where you have it installed 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.079
 then let's open the point 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.010
 minecraft we will find here or not if 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.549
 have with mods put there copy and paste 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.309
 you want the mod 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:07.340
 that is, they copy and paste me in this case 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.670
 will drag it 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.140
 and I will no longer move and replace 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.750
 would move to emplace and is already here 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.810
 fully installed now we create a 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.969
 new folder we give to new folder and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.590
 let's put this name already of the path 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.539
 I'll put them in the description of the video 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.990
 the links and the name of the folder 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.659
 we're going to have to open it and copy these 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.689
 three files or drag them 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.999
 and paste here once pasted are the 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.500
 themselves and you may realize it says boom 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.650
 sound 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.660
 and we are all here from here very 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.790
 well then once copied and pasted 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.150
 here they will have to execute the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.190
 minecraft and everything done once 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.750
 have done all this here we are going to 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.580
 open the launcher and cheese shop to open 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.170
 then I 'm going to proceed to make a 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.110
 transition because you are not going to record what 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.850
 what am I doing here then just 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.280
 I'm going to have to open the launcher and everything 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.560
 this from here 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.020
 I do not know if I do not have the video but I'll have 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.880
 that make the transition of late because 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.759
 is not going to notice in the video then I 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.510
 I'm going to do here to try the charts 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.480
 and we'll see you in a second or two 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.849
 and good guys here is the video 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.390
 then here we see that says minecraft 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.220
 1.6 point 21 points 6.4 that also 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.049
 would be worth to install we see that it is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.909
 installing these modes that I already had 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.349
 well that has nothing to do 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.269
 we see that here is the folder that 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.459
 we had created we had put the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.420
 name of knowledge pack then let's see 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.000
 here are 33 all three the files 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.680
 winrar what I told them to hit 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.569
 to give you where because I'm going to use this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.760
 first to show them and we're going to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.069
 give you select world is a world that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.069
 they already had it but let's see how it is 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.040
 we have to load 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.000
 they are going to order good there is
