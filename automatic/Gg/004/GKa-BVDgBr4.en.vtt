 get acquainted with the line of games double dragon 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.230
 the first game came out in 1987 on 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.570
 arcade machines and represented 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.950
 bitmap later she was ported to 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.540
 a bunch of home consoles 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.219
 At first, I donâ€™t 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.960
 it was observed but the fees of various 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.180
 platforms introduced a brief introduction 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.989
 and in the manual described in detail 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.550
 happening 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.710
 that the action of the game occurs post 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.559
 apocalyptic new york after 5 years 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.390
 after a nuclear war and the city is governed 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.250
 criminal gang and one of these 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.649
 factions for the sake of the girl was killed 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 that's the whole story but the game was different 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:12.280
 cool and got a few sequels and in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.110
 In 1994, the film was released by 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.030
 sensational lineup called double 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.619
 dragon this movie talked a lot about 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 two brothers jamie and bellelli 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.820
 who live under the tutelage of satori 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.210
 the woman who worked with her father 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.470
 brothers they all live incomprehensible 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.710
 postapocalyptic world does not exist 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.770
 poisonous rivers slums and all would be nothing but 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.990
 it even has a curfew which 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.490
 terrible world they live gin did not beat 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.909
 make a living by participating in 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.180
 tournaments and they are not very successful 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 due to lack of coherence 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.080
 same we will show the main bad guy 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 when the sludge who hunts for 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.760
 medallion double dragon which 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 empowers body and spirit in general as 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.620
 vodka in russia but he only has 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.100
 one half and the second is at 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.710
 satori bite learns it kills satori 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.020
 but before that she gives the medallion to the brothers 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.940
 they avoid going for help special squad 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.170
 where their leader does not see all this 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.929
 bullshit with medallions 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.730
 but decides to help them there is a mess 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.220
 like an ashug with a medallion 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.200
 grab the body jimmy 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.000
 there is a fight between brothers birch 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 duck activate the medallion beating 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.739
 jimmy sluga evict elects him 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.750
 the second half of the medallion and 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.620
 transformed into two blacks 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.280
 with swords 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.530
 that let us take it seriously 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.830
 the ultimate manifestation of the power of double 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.530
 dragon okay with weakness 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.080
 bitch fear of the world 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.760
 fear of the light you that this film in general 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.459
 wanted to shove all the stereotypes about 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.940
 African Americans why don't he then 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.000
 to be afraid of kluks-klan 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.520
 no matter the laws win him take away 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.220
 medallions and transformed and not him 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.220
 When the end of the frame and the guy with the harvest 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.810
 rhinestones and sparkles on suits 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.490
 oh god yeah hike these medallion 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.860
 possesses almost all Russian stars 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.250
 pop music going on mockery on 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.140
 slug his plant end agree agree 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.420
 it's pretty stupid but let's 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.520
 let's sort through the atmosphere of everything 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 the world in this film is a feeling that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.420
 Scriptwriters tried to screw something 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.060
 unusual add feeling that everywhere 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.580
 devastation and we see it visually but not 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.280
 feel we do not really explain what 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.900
 happened say that there was an earthquake 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.510
 then came the curfew and everything 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.730
 and by the way, the idea bothers me 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.530
 curfew just all the people 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 go home and give vent 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.940
 criminal gangs on the street and this 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.350
 really good decision why 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.240
 just can not mobilize all 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.390
 cops and go to war with bandits 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.730
 because they terrorize the city and me 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.200
 surprised by the reaction of the press to the fact that the gang 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.940
 began to attack people before 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.940
 curfew what happened 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.270
 really because the feelings of gangsters 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.040
 very worried about the cops 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.800
 I'm also interested in the main motivation 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.770
 hero sluga u wants to gain power over 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.540
 the city with the help of medallions and that forces 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.680
 American with black balls would have him 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.140
 but overall it helped but we did hike 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.390
 he is very rich and get power with his 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.910
 state of the ruined city is not 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.400
 would be worth the effort or he 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.940
 always was a loner he was not with anyone 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.940
 play basketball 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.590
 it explains the desire to get a locket 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.289
 you say authority power 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.860
 what can be said about the brothers themselves but 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.300
 ordinary such characters one stupid 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.719
 reckless other everyone is planning 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.930
 but duller and that's all I don't know what can 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:05:06.860
 about them still say well they are not joking 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:08.750
 what is important is that it is dangerous and not surprising 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.520
 some characters here is a daughter 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.430
 the cop who is the head 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.830
 special squad tidying up on the streets 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.539
 gives shelter to homeless children and deals with 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.800
 the most important task of the world 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.840
 and you thought it was just a joke 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.849
 right now during the meeting of the State Duma 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.560
 special squad for unwinding 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.510
 hula hoop of solves major problems 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.600
 countries they are your government 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.830
 all round deception round man twist 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 him 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.240
 You can still select such a character as 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.910
 and the woman is such a stupid jock with whom 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.070
 plainly and there was no fight but after 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.010
 sludge was not happy with his work he 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.120
 pumps it up with steroids and turns it into 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.310
 this pretty boy 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.740
 and everything would be fine but it still remains 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.140
 on the side of sludge after all this beauty 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.600
 he did not guess anything until 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.670
 looked in the mirror and he was not embarrassed that 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.170
 now he could not connect the palms in 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.040
 overall what can be said on this film 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:08.080
 an ordinary action movie with a typical villain 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.900
 giving back the spirit of the nineties which is already to 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.240
 By that time, everyone was tired of not a fight and 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.070
 not a joke pulled the film and yes 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.260
 quality of special effects not high 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.330
 level if you miss the nineties 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.400
 then you can watch this movie even though I 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.350
 you do not recommend it because there is 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.380
 a bunch of movies that better convey 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.910
 such feelings and by the way write in 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.790
 comments what movies do you have 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.620
