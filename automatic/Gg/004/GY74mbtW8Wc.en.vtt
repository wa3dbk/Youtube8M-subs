00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.770 
mean most of the games that I've played
I've<00:02:19.220> been<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.910> know<00:02:19.940> doing<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> same

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
I've been you know doing the same

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.430 
I've been you know doing the same
whatever<00:02:21.350> people<00:02:21.920> call<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> same<00:02:22.550> daggers

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
whatever people call the same daggers

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.540 
whatever people call the same daggers
most<00:02:24.440> likely<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:24.800> gonna<00:02:24.950> use<00:02:25.130> some<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.430> these

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
most likely I'm gonna use some of these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.610 
most likely I'm gonna use some of these
because<00:02:25.970> first<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.900> all<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.200> want<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.500> do

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
because first of all I just want to do

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.940 
because first of all I just want to do
everything<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:29.060> feels<00:02:29.209> consistent<00:02:29.950> just

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
everything that feels consistent just

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.920 
everything that feels consistent just
depends<00:02:31.250> how<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> game<00:02:31.580> goes<00:02:31.820> don't<00:02:32.690> really

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
depends how the game goes don't really

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.520 
depends how the game goes don't really
have<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.590> real<00:02:34.310> strategy<00:02:35.050> because<00:02:36.050> sometimes<00:02:36.440> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
have a real strategy because sometimes I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.070 
have a real strategy because sometimes I
would<00:02:36.709> but<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:38.360> gets<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:38.750> head<00:02:38.930> too

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
would but then it gets in your head too

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.720 
would but then it gets in your head too
much<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.560> skateboard<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.489> that's<00:02:40.670> not

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
much and skateboard and that's not

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.940 
much and skateboard and that's not
always<00:02:40.880> go<00:02:41.120> according<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.510> plan<00:02:41.600> or<00:02:42.019> most<00:02:42.830> of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
always go according to plan or most of

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.380 
always go according to plan or most of
the<00:02:43.040> time<00:02:43.250> skateboarding<00:02:43.640> doesn't<00:02:44.269> go

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the time skateboarding doesn't go

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.320 
the time skateboarding doesn't go
according<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.080> what<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.380> plan<00:02:45.560> do<00:02:45.799> so<00:02:46.330> can't

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
according to what you plan do so can't

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.750 
according to what you plan do so can't
plan<00:02:47.510> too<00:02:47.720> much
