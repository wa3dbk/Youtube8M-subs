00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.259
 At night or at dawn, you see 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.699
 our young mix channel is that today it will be 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.070
 a trick of the three hills is this 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.090
 trick for the father 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.130
 good people, hello people you came here 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.200
 saw it as a trick in the security of the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 following very simple way to 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.000
 first time romÃ¡rio right Copag 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.850
 21 cards 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.640
 he has 21 cards from the deck there goes 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.239
 fail whatever you want 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.250
 here you put three good and organ 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:51.489
 doing this way here next to the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:57.760
 another without a sequence can not lose 56 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:00.940
 in sequence did there give an example 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.739
 here we will say that the person you handle 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.740
 one is choosing the fourth choice 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.050
 the letter O're here so she's 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.440
 located in the middle as we go 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.140
 We can pull this much out of 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.390
 left both this right 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.450
 a charm of the importance of staying a month 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:37.960
 the first person the person 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:41.009
 so I pull half on top of three times 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.900
 You have to do the same process. 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:58.530
 Then I ask the person again to 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:02:11.500
 load or right pull pulls it will let you in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:13.120
 second doing this trick there you do 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.560
 a lower way the person is picking up 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.090
 At first 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.090
 only a person who wants to be 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:33.580
 up here then right 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:40.600
 right one two three four 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.340
 five six seven eight top 10 of the letter 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.820
 number 11 does not like the person who 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.830
 letter that will be from the person who needs it 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.880
 choose so that's how you make a 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.120
 procedure 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.840
 then you pick up and count until 11 and ours 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.190
 box and the house is easier and 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.870
 more ip's ok you liked I enjoyed 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.260
