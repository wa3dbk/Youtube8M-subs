00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:12.389
 Pauts zys here she and on plant she same 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.880
 another world original 2 came out 1991 on 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 computers atari and amiga in 90 second 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.170
 he was ported to home for us 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 Amos doses and other platforms for example 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.609
 super nintendo or sega mega drive 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.580
 the game was and remains gorgeous will carry 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.840
 coding and adventure is not very 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 cinematic screensavers and inserts in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 game process teach surprises and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.829
 Great graphics but I will not 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.600
 talk about how cool it is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 have already done my colleagues from gear from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 so I ask to love pixel and not to complain 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 and go to the link in the description of the video and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.300
 listen there the full story will go play 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.730
 and the creators of other games of the same people 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 etc. I'll tell you about android 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.949
 version of the game released 2012 transfer 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.270
 the graphics and sound are great but this 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.829
 and no wonder since in the game 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.230
 used innovative for your 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.699
 time idea vector graphics engine 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.579
 games use drawing technique 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.559
 like a modern flash drive that is all 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.299
 The objects are made up of clay geometric 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.070
 shapes are built by formulas 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.299
 so when transferring to higher 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.900
 permissions object they become 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.290
 blurred 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.330
 or pixel hundred besides in 2006 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.549
 there was a re-release of taiga under the set 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.409
 windows platforms including there were 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.890
 redrawn the background and changed part 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.930
 music 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 but for aesthetes she has 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 opportunity to choose classic graphics 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 while this village will not become stepped birds 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.400
 notch sdn like in childhood like us 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 remember 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.079
 maybe for someone it will be important 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 a moment apart from improving the graphics game 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.229
 became a little easier there were some 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.790
 difficulty levels 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.259
 distinguished by the presence or absence of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 some opponents 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.210
 check-points have become more but not to say 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.850
 so much more gas is also hardcore on 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 I even died in the first scene 10 times in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 Here's these creeping creatures 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.060
 well on the other side of survival you are new 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.500
 born for the player least should not be 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.150
 simple task right 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.770
 control in the game has 2 modes 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.180
 first classic version with 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.850
 on-screen buttons 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.740
 control of the second assr name with 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 running gestures like that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.130
 ran up the screen as our jumped 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 to the right 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.780
 ran but in this mode normally 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.330
 could not play die 100 or 5 times 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.100
 more often than usual in the ordinary in principle 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.720
 all the same is not so easy in the original 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.910
 besides the arrows there were two buttons one 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.490
 responsible for shooting and running strange 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.680
 combination but nonetheless 2 per leap 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.320
 plus jump will vomit button to the top 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.540
 then using only one button 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.490
 just for shooting well for staging 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 Analytical pants you will understand the campaign 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.870
 things about not leap stayed on the buttons in 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.850
 for centuries and you have to run twice 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.920
 press the direction button after which 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.600
 you can let her go 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 run even if you do not press the buttons 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.800
 In general, this moment is somewhat controversial with 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.150
 one side of course cool in 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 some scenes you can let go all 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.220
 the remaining buttons only press 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.930
 bounce 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.240
 it quickly changes it a little 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.860
 the current paradigm of management because 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.870
 it used to be so we run to 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 novice we need to release the button now 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.320
 we are already running without pressing a button to 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.660
 stop and some need to click 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.480
 the other is somewhat knocked down pantaliku 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.370
 so we donâ€™t know about the plan but 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.230
 curious but what's in the game really 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.880
 annoy so bugs 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.410
 First of all, it's a bad experience 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.480
 Minimize with home button 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.950
 switching another application so 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.780
 as a result, you can run two or three 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.300
 application instance get on this 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.190
 screen keep that in mind and where such 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.400
 behavior is not on positive for 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.890
 mobile application in the second cleaning 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.530
 I do not like checks you make me like this 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.360
 wildness in the end why not give 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.550
 for example progress for passing level 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.739
 I'll go and tattoo rainy if the game 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.000
 interesting I will play further why him 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.100
 they are somehow extra 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.260
 incomprehensible what awards given are not 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.510
 I understand this here looked first these 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.000
 mistakes and for looking out the window 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.400
 super great achivka first not 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.620
 disabled that I have wildly enraged and 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.100
 secondly after receiving the cleaning always 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.600
 begins to burn ayshe slow it terribly 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.370
 and while the game is impossible 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.770
 normally shut down if you don't have 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.750
 separate task manager of some kind if 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.130
 did you roll try the connector 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.230
 what happens about this picture 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.330
 amazingly true tank reproduced 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.709
 on all devices available to me this 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.019
 highscreen boost phone 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.230
 this is some samsung phone with 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.510
 large screen and console dex ds 5110 b 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.790
 All together limit the situation with the game is very 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.680
 controversial on the one hand the game remains 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.750
 great nobody can just put 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.360
 cross on its normal passage a 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.220
 free test version of the game is not so 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.770
 what to know is there a bug or not you can only 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.930
 having installed it that is having bought so 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.990
 perhaps the best choice would be to play 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.450
 this game on the emulator atari sega dosbox 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.280
 and in the end were to be ready quickly 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.020
 after purchase return design money 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.460
 like google play gives the opportunity 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.390
 do in a very very limited 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.520
 time span 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.890
 first half an hour like honestly not 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.290
 I remember for a long time did not use such here 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.600
 we are not really funny things so on 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.710
 This is probably all thanks for your attention and 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.710
 see you soon 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040
