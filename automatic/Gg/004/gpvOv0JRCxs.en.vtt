we<00:00:16.850> can<00:00:17.029> see<00:00:17.330> up<00:00:17.960> here

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
we can see up here

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.910 
we can see up here
our<00:00:19.970> ridge<00:00:21.280> coming<00:00:22.280> through<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:24.140> our<00:00:24.440> rafters

holding up the pitch but the good thing
for<00:00:37.069> us<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.609> that<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.989> ridge<00:00:39.260> doesn't<00:00:39.649> run

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
for us is that the ridge doesn't run

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.590 
for us is that the ridge doesn't run
into<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.100> chimney<00:00:40.309> sometimes<00:00:41.059> these<00:00:41.300> old

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
into the chimney sometimes these old

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.189 
into the chimney sometimes these old
chimneys<00:00:42.079> used<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:42.769> support<00:00:43.640> our<00:00:44.539> brickwork

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
chimneys used to support our brickwork

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.290 
chimneys used to support our brickwork
is<00:00:45.409> to<00:00:45.559> support<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.159> ridge<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:46.789> we're<00:00:47.059> pretty

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
is to support the ridge so we're pretty

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.959 
is to support the ridge so we're pretty
lucky<00:00:47.870> here<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:49.129> don't<00:00:49.339> have<00:00:49.579> any<00:00:49.789> of

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
lucky here that we don't have any of

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.809 
lucky here that we don't have any of
that<00:00:50.179> and<00:00:50.629> if<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.899> come<00:00:51.139> back<00:00:51.309> you<00:00:52.309> can<00:00:52.339> see

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
that and if we come back you can see

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.219 
that and if we come back you can see
that<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:54.170> roof<00:00:54.469> itself<00:00:55.039> is<00:00:55.639> free<00:00:56.059> spanning<00:00:56.629> we

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
that the roof itself is free spanning we

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.709 
that the roof itself is free spanning we
will<00:00:57.469> have<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.859> put<00:00:58.039> in<00:00:58.069> a<00:00:58.249> couple<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.719> noggins

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
will have to put in a couple of noggins

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.289 
will have to put in a couple of noggins
through<00:01:00.139> here<00:01:00.440> no<00:01:01.399> worries<00:01:01.819> that<00:01:02.030> will<00:01:02.120> just

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
through here no worries that will just

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.489 
through here no worries that will just
support<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.749> we<00:01:02.870> can<00:01:02.989> pull<00:01:03.139> the<00:01:03.229> rest<00:01:03.350> of

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
support that we can pull the rest of

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.340 
support that we can pull the rest of
that<00:01:03.589> chimney<00:01:03.979> down<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:05.210> then<00:01:05.390> we<00:01:05.600> will<00:01:05.840> cut

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
that chimney down and then we will cut

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.679 
that chimney down and then we will cut
these<00:01:06.560> sheets<00:01:06.920> out<00:01:07.130> at<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:07.549> top<00:01:07.789> and<00:01:08.000> replace

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
these sheets out at the top and replace

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.370 
these sheets out at the top and replace
these<00:01:09.020> sheets<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:11.200> roof<00:01:12.200> will

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
these sheets so that the roof will

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.740 
these sheets so that the roof will
continue<00:01:12.799> through<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.430> we'll<00:01:14.210> have<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.539> all

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
continue through and we'll have that all

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.800 
continue through and we'll have that all
sealed<00:01:15.289> up<00:01:15.500> from<00:01:16.009> all<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.280> weather<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.360> from

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
sealed up from all the weather so from

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.209 
sealed up from all the weather so from
here<00:01:18.079> you<00:01:18.259> can<00:01:18.409> see<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:20.000> this<00:01:20.740> mortar<00:01:21.740> again

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
here you can see that this mortar again

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.880 
here you can see that this mortar again
is<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:22.729> breaking<00:01:23.210> off<00:01:23.509> in<00:01:23.960> our<00:01:24.380> hands

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
is just breaking off in our hands

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.760 
is just breaking off in our hands
there's<00:01:25.520> no<00:01:26.030> integrity<00:01:26.450> white<00:01:26.930> soever<00:01:27.530> in

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
there's no integrity white soever in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.580 
there's no integrity white soever in
that<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.490> chimney<00:01:28.969> is<00:01:29.539> completely<00:01:30.140> ChaCha's

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
that the chimney is completely ChaCha's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.520 
that the chimney is completely ChaCha's
so<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.700> wasn't<00:01:32.090> going<00:01:32.179> to<00:01:32.240> work<00:01:32.299> anyway<00:01:32.869> so

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
so it wasn't going to work anyway so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.200 
so it wasn't going to work anyway so
it's<00:01:34.039> a<00:01:34.070> good<00:01:34.100> thing<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.399> we<00:01:34.579> are<00:01:34.759> pulling<00:01:35.000> it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
it's a good thing that we are pulling it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.190 
it's a good thing that we are pulling it
down<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:36.850> next<00:01:37.850> stage<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.450> remove<00:01:38.869> all<00:01:39.079> of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
down that next stage is to remove all of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.219 
down that next stage is to remove all of
these<00:01:39.320> bricks<00:01:39.619> down<00:01:39.859> here<00:01:40.960> down<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
these bricks down here down to the

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.130 
these bricks down here down to the
ceiling<00:01:42.619> height<00:01:42.829> um<00:01:43.479> we'll<00:01:44.479> take<00:01:44.929> all<00:01:45.109> of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
ceiling height um we'll take all of

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.660 
ceiling height um we'll take all of
these<00:01:45.320> bricks<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.799> we'll<00:01:45.890> reuse<00:01:46.490> them

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
these bricks and we'll reuse them

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.889 
these bricks and we'll reuse them
because<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.939> bricks<00:01:47.119> themselves<00:01:47.659> are<00:01:47.749> still

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
because the bricks themselves are still

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.649 
because the bricks themselves are still
in<00:01:47.990> quite<00:01:48.200> good<00:01:48.229> working<00:01:49.189> order<00:01:49.539> we'll<00:01:50.539> be

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
in quite good working order we'll be

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.139 
in quite good working order we'll be
able<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.899> recycle<00:01:51.320> those<00:01:51.679> into<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> structural

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
able to recycle those into a structural

for paving or anything else you can
think<00:02:04.999> of<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:06.380> next<00:02:07.280> stay<00:02:07.460> tuned<00:02:07.789> we'll<00:02:08.119> be

think of so next stay tuned we'll be
pulling<00:02:08.840> down<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.110> rest<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.380> those<00:02:09.500> bricks

pulling down the rest of those bricks

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.340
