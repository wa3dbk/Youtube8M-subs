 also the fia if you can more is to pass 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.170
 here is always was his difficulty 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 that is the difficulty of the campaign that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 per recruit will be equal to the boxes of 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.150
 regular recruiting campaign 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:20.840

 and it's here รณ you can choose too 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.890
 I almost all think that almost everyone or 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 all types of games you already have 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.630
 They are usually released which are all 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.790
 young people you can choose to save 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 and make a service and also forever 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.290
 You open the coffin game show is a game 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.250
 of boat opens the same map number 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.250
 boston a certain 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.909
 here you can also dictate the rules of the game 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.770
 timeout score 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.849
 the times when the teams will have is because 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 you can have that reason also happens is 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.370
 what holds all here all the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
 normal settings 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.130
 of the game and went practically 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.670
 Enjoy that mess with a boat. 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:35.100
 at 7min the life regeneration 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.420
 I'm friend of the type of attack 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 completely avoidable 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.060
 you can create the class class class 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.860
 that you will use is here all the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.170
 all equipment are available 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.239
 everything everything that can be read in the text 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.620
 so here is very good you want 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.970
 to test the equipment that is 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.670
 available in the game 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.410
 this is very obvious type you want to see 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.600
 how the equipment works is whether 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.370
 may be gonna have to unlock him 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.859
 future to spend a little bit 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.959
 So you can leave here then test 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.209
 he playing against the boats to see if 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.700
 You really want to block it. 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.070
 classes are all released because it is the 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.630
 Secondary charges year single 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:25.660
 primary attachment that all released 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:31.690
 I even think that there is not the image 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:34.000
 is released all released is also 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.670
 that you can record too ok me 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.070
 I remember that you can record the match and 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.489
 leave mold after it can chat 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.730
 youtube and and so this is the kind of 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.769
 I'm going to start a game to make one here. 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.760
 to show you how it works was in the 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.090
 phone 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.689
 It's a motto to leave that way, even if you wanted to. 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.269
 be college the year as the same 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:08.930
 The one I'm going to choose is the place of 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:10.920
 Here we go to create the class cw 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.400
 same as I 'll use 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.680
 then you click on start mete simple 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.169
 Just remember that way you do not win. 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.650
 xp that will find the real multiplayer 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.150
 seventh private mete-no mw3 plays alone 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.669
 that instead of playing in the complex you 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.669
 choose you're going to be playing with boats 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.759
 What do you two houses have? 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:40.490
 those common classes I also think 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.919
 there begins the download in the votes to 3 to 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.620
 architecture in the name of all 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.639
 boxes the names of those who participated in the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.639
 breeding of rabbits 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.710
 I they are not a boto make a 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.259
 attractive is the difficulty it really is 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.810
 they are not that poorly made boats that 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.069
 seems to be using it in search of small 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.050
 behind his back 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.370
 they see of course that this person 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.629
 computer only that he 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:21.639
 they will not go to you have 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:23.500
 interesting that this new way 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.060
 involved it seems that you are really 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.319
 some people if you put them in the 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.430
 difficulties is more difficult if you 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.289
 placed the easier plane they did not 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.860
 have seen a common content in which 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:42.129
 draws them map he was not in sight 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.690
 bread is very interesting this 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:49.409
 game and all that are working 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.409
 perfectly 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.780
 It is quite interesting game mode 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.789
 this is the first commented video of 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.860

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.509
 Speak and if you like, do not like it. 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.070

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.710

 passing this on to you for now 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.009
 because it's still not all right for 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.720
 make the main videos of gameplay 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.639

 People expect to make a gay flexx a lot 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.490
 interesting for you to show how 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.009
 really the game works and that's it for 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.900
