00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
each one of those regions there's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.750 
each one of those regions there's

those mountains there's multiple drop
points<00:00:25.530> so<00:00:26.280> we<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.490> NASA<00:00:26.760> topographical<00:00:27.539> data

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
points so we use NASA topographical data

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.450 
points so we use NASA topographical data
as<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.110> foundation<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.710> peaks<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> game

as the foundation for peaks in the game

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
as the foundation for peaks in the game
we<00:00:29.940> take<00:00:30.180> that<00:00:30.360> data<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.779> run<00:00:30.930> it<00:00:31.050> through

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
we take that data and we run it through

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.510 
we take that data and we run it through

mountain man which is proprietary
software<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.359> we<00:00:33.420> got<00:00:33.539> to<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> point<00:00:33.870> early<00:00:34.230> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
software and we got to a point early in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.450 
software and we got to a point early in
development<00:00:34.440> where<00:00:34.949> we<00:00:35.070> could<00:00:35.219> literally

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
development where we could literally

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.010 
development where we could literally
type<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> latitude<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.600> longitude

press<00:00:39.630> a<00:00:39.660> button<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> mountain<00:00:40.500> man<00:00:40.620> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
press a button and mountain man we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
press a button and mountain man we
create<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> three-dimensional<00:00:41.340> model<00:00:41.970> of<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
create a three-dimensional model of that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.750 
create a three-dimensional model of that
mountain<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.050> under<00:00:43.260> 28<00:00:43.739> seconds<00:00:44.309> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
mountain in just under 28 seconds so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
mountain in just under 28 seconds so
with<00:00:44.880> that<00:00:45.059> let's<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.870> jump<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.140> into<00:00:46.410> our

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
with that let's just jump right into our

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.100 
with that let's just jump right into our
first<00:00:46.800> region<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.460> Himalayas<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
first region the Himalayas so the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.870 
first region the Himalayas so the
Himalayas<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:50.040> about<00:00:50.430> two<00:00:50.850> very

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
Himalayas are really about two very

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.120 
Himalayas are really about two very
distinct<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:52.050> styles<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.950> lower

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
distinct different styles at the lower

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.400 
distinct different styles at the lower
altitudes<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.020> Great<00:00:55.200> Wall

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
altitudes it's all about the Great Wall

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
altitudes it's all about the Great Wall
of<00:00:55.440> China<00:00:55.559> you're<00:00:56.250> gonna<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.489> able<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.700> jump

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of China you're gonna be able to jump

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
of China you're gonna be able to jump
over<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.300> ride<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> grind<00:00:58.559> along<00:00:58.860> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
over that ride down it grind along the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
over that ride down it grind along the
edge<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.670> statues<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.540> prayer<00:01:00.750> flags

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
edge of it the statues the prayer flags

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
edge of it the statues the prayer flags
all<00:01:01.500> things<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.950> give<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.309> region<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
all things that give that region a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.490 
all things that give that region a
unique<00:01:03.030> sort<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.360> look<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.289> higher

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
unique sort of look at the higher

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.590 
unique sort of look at the higher
altitude<00:01:05.039> though<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.729> Himalayas<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.509> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
altitude though the Himalayas is one of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
altitude though the Himalayas is one of
the<00:01:06.659> most<00:01:06.780> gnarly<00:01:07.229> epic<00:01:07.649> regions<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the most gnarly epic regions in the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.609 
the most gnarly epic regions in the
world<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.060> deadly<00:01:09.420> descent<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.170> something<00:01:10.500> we

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
world the deadly descent is something we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
world the deadly descent is something we
call<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.340> air<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.940> here<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> terrain<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> much

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
call in air so here the terrain is much

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
call in air so here the terrain is much
more<00:01:13.080> craggy<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> rough<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.220> makes<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
more craggy and rough and it makes it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.680 
more craggy and rough and it makes it
really<00:01:14.610> difficult<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
really difficult to get down the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.270 
really difficult to get down the
mountain<00:01:15.720> quickly<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.950> something<00:01:17.130> you're

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
mountain quickly that's something you're

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
mountain quickly that's something you're
going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.520> trying<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:18.030> before<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.780> run

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
going to be trying to do before you run

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.050 
going to be trying to do before you run
out<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.110> oxygen<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> Himalayas<00:01:20.700> overall

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
out of oxygen so the Himalayas overall

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.179 
out of oxygen so the Himalayas overall
have<00:01:21.299> these<00:01:21.450> two<00:01:21.689> amazingly<00:01:22.260> contrasting

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
have these two amazingly contrasting

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.500 
have these two amazingly contrasting
styles<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.850> think<00:01:24.090> make<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.270> an

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
styles that we think make it an

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.810 
styles that we think make it an
incredibly<00:01:24.960> rich<00:01:25.229> experience<00:01:25.799> our<00:01:26.640> next

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
incredibly rich experience our next

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
incredibly rich experience our next
region<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> Alaska<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.650> when<00:01:28.830> we

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
region is Alaska and you know when we

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
region is Alaska and you know when we
look<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.130> Alaska<00:01:29.670> definitely<00:01:30.510> one<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
look at Alaska definitely one of the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.570 
look at Alaska definitely one of the
most<00:01:30.900> iconic<00:01:31.140> landmarks<00:01:31.500> even<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> world

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
most iconic landmarks even in the world

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.429 
most iconic landmarks even in the world
is<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> Alaskan<00:01:33.360> pipeline<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> thought

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is the Alaskan pipeline so we thought

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
is the Alaskan pipeline so we thought
it'd<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.860> cool<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> build<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:36.060> gigantic

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it'd be really cool to build a gigantic

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.740 
it'd be really cool to build a gigantic
SSX<00:01:37.830> version<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> Alaskan<00:01:38.909> pipeline<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
SSX version of the Alaskan pipeline that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
SSX version of the Alaskan pipeline that
you<00:01:39.869> could<00:01:40.020> ride<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> grind<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:41.009> top<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> these

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you could ride and grind on top of these

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
you could ride and grind on top of these
huge<00:01:41.880> pipes<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.170> Alaska<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.860> start<00:01:44.130> by

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
huge pipes so in Alaska you start by

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
huge pipes so in Alaska you start by
going<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.729> these<00:01:44.909> crazy<00:01:45.210> ridge<00:01:45.450> lines<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
going down these crazy ridge lines that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.630 
going down these crazy ridge lines that
open<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.530> into<00:01:46.650> this<00:01:46.890> valley<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
open up into this valley and there you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
open up into this valley and there you
see<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.850> Alaskan<00:01:48.420> pipeline<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.650> get<00:01:49.799> up

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
see the Alaskan pipeline you can get up

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
see the Alaskan pipeline you can get up
on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> pipeline<00:01:50.430> ride<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.840> avoid

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
on the pipeline ride down it avoid

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
on the pipeline ride down it avoid
avalanches<00:01:52.950> jump<00:01:53.340> off<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.880> back<00:01:53.909> on

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
avalanches jump off and get back on

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
avalanches jump off and get back on
again<00:01:54.420> takes<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.590> down<00:01:55.799> through

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
again takes you all the way down through

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.180 
again takes you all the way down through
the<00:01:56.130> valley<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> finish

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
the valley down to the finish

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.280 
the valley down to the finish
so<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:57.940> Alaska<00:01:58.420> you're<00:01:58.600> literally<00:01:58.900> going<00:01:59.200> to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
so in Alaska you're literally going to

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.050 
so in Alaska you're literally going to
have<00:01:59.410> snow<00:01:59.620> crumbling<00:02:00.490> underneath<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:01.030> your

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
have snow crumbling underneath of your

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.840 
have snow crumbling underneath of your
board<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.660> every<00:02:02.260> run<00:02:02.440> poses<00:02:02.950> huge<00:02:03.310> risks<00:02:03.730> of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
board and every run poses huge risks of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.180 
board and every run poses huge risks of
avalanches<00:02:04.480> overall<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:05.500> think<00:02:05.590> Alaska

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
avalanches overall I think Alaska

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.980 
avalanches overall I think Alaska
provides<00:02:06.610> an<00:02:06.910> incredibly<00:02:07.480> unique<00:02:07.750> gameplay

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
provides an incredibly unique gameplay

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.890 
provides an incredibly unique gameplay
experience<00:02:08.650> across<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.070> board<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:10.540> next<00:02:10.690> up

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
experience across the board so next up

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.930 
experience across the board so next up
we<00:02:11.050> have<00:02:11.080> Siberia<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:12.070> know<00:02:12.190> Siberia<00:02:12.640> stands

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
we have Siberia you know Siberia stands

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
we have Siberia you know Siberia stands
in<00:02:13.120> stark<00:02:13.240> contrast<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.260> Himalayas<00:02:14.890> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
in stark contrast to the Himalayas and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.250 
in stark contrast to the Himalayas and
to<00:02:15.280> Alaska<00:02:15.880> definitely<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.690> our<00:02:16.810> darker

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
to Alaska definitely one of our darker

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.990 
to Alaska definitely one of our darker
environments<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.370> Siberia's<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.940> my

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
environments so Siberia's one of my

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.310 
environments so Siberia's one of my
favorite<00:02:19.360> tracks<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.720> visual<00:02:19.870> standpoint

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
favorite tracks from a visual standpoint

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.500 
favorite tracks from a visual standpoint
it's<00:02:21.100> got<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> really<00:02:21.400> impressive<00:02:21.700> stormy<00:02:22.330> feel

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
it's got a really impressive stormy feel

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.790 
it's got a really impressive stormy feel
to<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.750> you'd<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.350> down<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> mountain

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
to it you'd be going down the mountain

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.410 
to it you'd be going down the mountain
when<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.220> come<00:02:24.340> around<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.610> corner<00:02:24.940> you're

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
when you come around the corner you're

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.150 
when you come around the corner you're
gonna<00:02:25.540> come<00:02:25.780> out<00:02:25.900> into<00:02:26.080> an<00:02:26.290> abandoned<00:02:27.010> nuclear

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
gonna come out into an abandoned nuclear

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.070 
gonna come out into an abandoned nuclear
plant<00:02:27.670> gonna<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.090> lots<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.450> opportunities<00:02:29.050> for

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
plant gonna be lots of opportunities for

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.320 
plant gonna be lots of opportunities for
big<00:02:29.560> tricks<00:02:29.890> big<00:02:30.310> air<00:02:30.520> all<00:02:30.790> kinds<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.120> stuff

it's<00:02:31.660> one<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> our<00:02:32.080> widest<00:02:32.680> maps<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.220> are

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it's one of our widest maps there are

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.830 
it's one of our widest maps there are
literally<00:02:33.520> hundreds<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.210> different<00:02:34.330> ways<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
literally hundreds of different ways to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.270 
literally hundreds of different ways to
get<00:02:34.960> down<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.320> mountain<00:02:35.350> but<00:02:35.920> we<00:02:36.040> couldn't

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
get down the mountain but we couldn't

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.890 
get down the mountain but we couldn't
talk<00:02:36.430> about<00:02:36.490> Siberia<00:02:37.300> without<00:02:37.570> talking<00:02:37.870> about

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
talk about Siberia without talking about

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.300 
talk about Siberia without talking about
ice<00:02:38.200> because<00:02:38.590> that's<00:02:38.800> what<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> deadly

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
ice because that's what the deadly

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.490 
ice because that's what the deadly
descent<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:39.970> Siberia<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.720> all<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
mountains are gonna find in Siberia have

very<00:02:45.280> little<00:02:45.520> snow<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.090> ice<00:02:46.270> definitely

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
very little snow the ice definitely

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.960 
very little snow the ice definitely
brings<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.290> completely<00:02:47.890> unique<00:02:47.920> wrinkle<00:02:48.580> to

brings a completely unique wrinkle to
the<00:02:49.060> region<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.570> Siberia<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.250> wraps<00:02:51.400> up

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610
