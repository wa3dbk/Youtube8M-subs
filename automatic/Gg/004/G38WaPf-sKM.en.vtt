mean<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.110> not<00:01:59.230> responding<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:00.130> almost

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
mean is not responding because almost

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.830 
mean is not responding because almost
everybody<00:02:00.730> responds<00:02:01.390> when<00:02:01.540> we<00:02:01.660> give<00:02:01.810> the

everybody responds when we give the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.200 
everybody responds when we give the
treatment<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.070> relapsing<00:02:03.640> quickly<00:02:04.000> when

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
treatment but is relapsing quickly when

treatment but is relapsing quickly when
the<00:02:04.300> treatment<00:02:04.660> stops<00:02:04.930> well<00:02:05.440> somewhere

the treatment stops well somewhere

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.920 
the treatment stops well somewhere
