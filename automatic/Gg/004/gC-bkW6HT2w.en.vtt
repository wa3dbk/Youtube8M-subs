00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.140
 sauce people welcome 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.160
 a new video we speak today 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.289
 full of the recent acts 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.869
 yes what it is because in the first line 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.580
 at titan of dear lord in the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.250
 middle explains us that here and we 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 should hard place in this mission 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 one knows from taking 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.579
 different game missions like 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.470
 For example, domination that you have here 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.750
 a bit connected with each other 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.370
 the whole called point nomination 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.300
 and a bit of a change 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.880
 brought in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 yes, of course, you can also see it right away 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.129
 the second scene that titans one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.620
 not so small role in this 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.629
 play but the nice thing about the game 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.860
 game is you have definitely the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.840
 possibility not to use the titans 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.910
 and to run as a foot soldier that is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.680
 you do not have to share that with her 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.330
 can also share in auto mode 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.220
 and you can take him with you 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.319
 as he proceeds in sharing people 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 Say how you take flags like you 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.840
 Kill an opponent that stays completely free 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.740
 because you have completely free 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.929
 Freedom of movement So now I have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 three times freedom so who said that 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.619
 not enough that definitely has to be 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.950
 play game yourself 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 sometimes i can not see my eyes 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.649
 let play because it is so blatant 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.929
 going 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.330
 you run in one point agree sees it 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.550
 Here are the bots still with it 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.910
 it's like you're playing against an opponent 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.649
 team of pilots and a team 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.590
 from potsdam that means you have 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.840
 an opponent team, so to speak 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.009
 consists of human opponents and out 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.780
 opponents exists 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.429
 the whole is really not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.050
 annoying but it is so real that one 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.849
 such a kind of a small one 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.880
 has a sense of achievement when you have these too 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.770
 opponent with away scratches but I have to completely 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 be honest after the first ten 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.720
 hours shared I'm full 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.670
 excited about the game because the game 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.840
 offers a call of duty battlefield 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.660
 fans really everything you want 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.680
 One has this close combat action one 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:27.879
 has these distance fights one has the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:31.040
 constant explosions cinema dvd 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.540
 explosions aka michael bay where you 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.459
 just squats in front of the screen and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 Wow really cool 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.180
 Basically it is structured like that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.340
 have a system where you have your pilots 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.959
 could miss lot that means you can 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.510
 equip him with a weapon 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.299
 There are quite normal carbine weapons 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.500
 there are smbs there lmg it the 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.390
 but they are really very 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.560
 kept minimalist so from the he 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.650
 not to overwhelm 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.510
 then you serve an antique weapon 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.709
 so to speak for air defense in 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.739
 quotation marks 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.900
 then you have two things that still 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.400
 can take extra as putty that is 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 there you can pack something else 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.260
 then have a tactical ability and 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.640
 Of course, a grenade clear a pistol 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.660
 you have it with you, but it will be sooner 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.549
 used less often 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.750
 next is it you have one 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.970
 title going on 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.730
 that means you can of course your part 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.680
 new best friend or there as in 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.310
 call of duty, so to speak, a bit 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.139
 pimp 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 You can customize it by choosing one 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.519
 weapon im gives a tactical ability 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.670
 there is a second weapon there that it 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.410
 Rockets, so to speak, similar to ours earlier 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.670
 already seen in the video then have 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.180
 her the possibility of two more kids 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.780
 pack and then it works 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.780
 Come on 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.580
 in days full there are several 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.340
 play it over the classic team 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.510
 deathmatch mode the title between 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.730
 means over the mode load standing where 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.160
 It's about everyone from the team starts 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.260
 with a second man playing again 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.260
 a kind of team deathmatch only with titans 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.270
 and everyone has a life, so to speak 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.460
 of course it counts the last part of the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.970
 survived then is the winner of the 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.040
 team 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.560
 then there is the just mentioned 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.450
 mode hard point domination where it comes from 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.140
 goes to conquer flags and these to 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.840
 hold 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.910
 also a very popular game mode and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.830
 then, of course, the mode of opinion 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.590
 after not missing is capture 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.060
 the flag here too in the video too 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.910
 see capture the flag makes of course 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.920
 with titans fun or even without titans 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.870
 Here you can do your parcours skills 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.720
 on the different sizes and 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.330
 play small cards in any case 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.490
 and use that to your advantage 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.530
 Then there is the mode pilote 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.850
 hunter I personally even now 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.860
 I could not play, I was somehow 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.490
 so enthusiastic about the other game modes 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 soir 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.170
 and somehow most of the plays 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.910
 my friend list mostly only the 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.040
 normal game mode the halt team 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.530
 based or objective based 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.970
 the last one is even as a barrier 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.890
 the pack will just be here 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.420
 bit mixed by that's for the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.310
 interesting that I just want to say 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.060
 just want everything a bit 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.570
 yes, if we have such a short time now 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.730
 Conclusion want to draw on the game what 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.370
 is that the first thing I can say 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.800
 yes i think sharing is really very much 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.890
 very brilliant made you have to start 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.860
 a game every time this state 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.570
 bringing a bit of innovation is like that 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.160
 a kind of start screen 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.350
 then you can also class his times 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.540
 lotz adjust there are so-called burn 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.340
 cards with which you can once again yours 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.080
 you can boost your skills 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.540
 Example right at the beginning of the titan 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.190
 Call you have a deck of 30 cards 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.320
 exist then you can then this byrne 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.800
 record cards and always three of them 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.110
 you can play with them 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.060
 That's something to share in my opinion 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.129
 after really very good 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.319
 What a pity I find something 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.879
 i also have to honestly say that 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.310
 I personally had a title fight 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.919
 bit tactical presented that is 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.110
 really pure on it and who 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.409
 just better the hold sooner 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.509
 winner, but nonetheless is good 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.389
 it did a full play on everyone 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.819
 currently at the right time 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.560
 came because many were simply disappointed 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.509
 battlefield are and by call of duty 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.129
 and just a little one 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.229
 have desired change and with 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:24.539
 this game they have on each 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.580
 case yes then we come to the end of 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.669
 I was pleased that she watched the videos 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.969
 you also check it out at 3 x games 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:36.919
 if you are looking for current games so far 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.919
 then your goal servus
