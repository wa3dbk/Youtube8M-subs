00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
left hand side and at this point I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
left hand side and at this point I
realize<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.820> epic<00:01:36.000> fail<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.600> my<00:01:36.720> hands

to win this raid I have one lightning
spell<00:01:41.310> left<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:41.759> means<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> use<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
spell left which means I can use that to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
spell left which means I can use that to
destroy<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.409> building<00:01:43.799> they<00:01:43.920> had<00:01:44.009> 47%<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.119> you

this<00:01:51.420> raid<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> realized<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> very

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
this raid is if I realized in the very

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.649 
this raid is if I realized in the very
beginning<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> didn't<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.299> king<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
beginning that I didn't have my king and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.569 
beginning that I didn't have my king and
queen<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.140> still<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:55.979> destroyed<00:01:56.399> him

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
queen I still could have destroyed him

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.190 
queen I still could have destroyed him
with<00:01:56.670> those<00:01:56.790> golems<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.509> dropped<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> golem

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
with those golems if I dropped a golem

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
with those golems if I dropped a golem
on<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> left<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.920> top<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> right

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
on the left on the top and on the right

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700 
on the left on the top and on the right
and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> followed<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> golem<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.590> with

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and then I followed that golem up with

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.770 
and then I followed that golem up with
witches<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.280> wizards<00:02:02.490> there's<00:02:03.180> no<00:02:03.450> doubt<00:02:03.659> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
witches and wizards there's no doubt in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.359 
witches and wizards there's no doubt in
my<00:02:03.810> mind<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.200> could<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.469> gotten<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> 50%<00:02:05.100> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
my mind I could have gotten the 50% on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
my mind I could have gotten the 50% on
the<00:02:05.460> base<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.969> since<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.299> started<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.719> drop<00:02:06.869> my

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the base but since I started to drop my

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
the base but since I started to drop my
golems<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:07.979> side<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> thought

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
golems all in one side because I thought

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.210 
golems all in one side because I thought
I<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.179> my<00:02:09.330> king<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.750> queen<00:02:10.220> that's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I would have my king in my queen that's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.620 
I would have my king in my queen that's
where<00:02:11.580> things<00:02:11.819> went

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
where things went

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.200 
where things went
and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> failure<00:02:13.680> occurred<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and the failure occurred and it's this

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.120 
and the failure occurred and it's this
is<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:15.840> exactly<00:02:16.740> how<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> thought

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
is just really exactly how I thought

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.580 
is just really exactly how I thought
this<00:02:17.490> series<00:02:17.790> would<00:02:17.940> go<00:02:18.120> down<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.810> if<00:02:19.320> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
this series would go down because if you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.140 
this series would go down because if you
guys<00:02:19.710> remember<00:02:19.860> my<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.520> clan<00:02:20.970> war

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
guys remember my very first clan war

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.910 
guys remember my very first clan war
battle<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.600> ever<00:02:21.780> had<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.320> didn't<00:02:22.620> bring<00:02:22.740> any

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
battle I ever had I didn't bring any

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.340 
battle I ever had I didn't bring any
troops<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.850> lost<00:02:24.090> my<00:02:24.360> very<00:02:24.570> first<00:02:24.870> clan<00:02:25.140> war

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
troops and I lost my very first clan war

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200 
troops and I lost my very first clan war
battle<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.160> really<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.970> bad<00:02:27.150> luck

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
battle and I really just have bad luck

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.720 
battle and I really just have bad luck
when<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.660> comes<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.960> stuff<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.250> it's

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
when it comes to stuff like this so it's

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.120 
when it comes to stuff like this so it's
a<00:02:29.940> real<00:02:30.240> shame<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.650> how<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.950> went

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
a real shame that this is how it went

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.770 
a real shame that this is how it went
down<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> don't<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.480> where<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.690> go

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
down so I don't really know where to go

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.050 
down so I don't really know where to go
from<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.770> really<00:02:35.130> sucks<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.700> didn't

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
from here it really sucks that I didn't

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790 
from here it really sucks that I didn't
lose<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.510> legitimate<00:02:36.990> raid<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.440> end<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
lose the legitimate raid to end the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.700 
lose the legitimate raid to end the
series<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.910> wish<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.450> base<00:02:39.720> beat<00:02:40.260> me<00:02:40.440> or

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
series like I wish some base beat me or

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.440 
series like I wish some base beat me or
something<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.370> but<00:02:41.580> instead<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.330> a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
something like that but instead it's a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.120 
something like that but instead it's a
technicality<00:02:42.900> because<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.470> didn't<00:02:43.830> bring<00:02:43.950> my

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
technicality because I didn't bring my

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.970 
technicality because I didn't bring my
king<00:02:44.400> or<00:02:44.670> my<00:02:44.850> queen<00:02:45.210> but<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.440> guess<00:02:46.620> that's<00:02:46.770> sort

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
king or my queen but I guess that's sort

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.370 
king or my queen but I guess that's sort
of<00:02:47.070> how<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.220> cookie<00:02:47.520> crumbles<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:48.380> that's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
of how the cookie crumbles and that's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.290 
of how the cookie crumbles and that's
why<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.620> shouldn't<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.070> an<00:02:50.190> idiot<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.730> always

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
why you shouldn't be an idiot and always

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.910 
why you shouldn't be an idiot and always
check<00:02:51.600> your<00:02:51.630> army<00:02:52.020> composition<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.620> make<00:02:52.770> sure

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
check your army composition to make sure

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.220 
check your army composition to make sure
you<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.310> heroes<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.120> stuff<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.990> that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
you have your heroes and stuff like that
