00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.800 
technique of how I do my flocks to keep
my<00:04:01.790> definition<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.800> check<00:04:04.070> out<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.310> shine<00:04:07.810> so

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
my definition so check out that shine so

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.930 
my definition so check out that shine so
now<00:04:09.170> when<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.620> comes<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.130> our<00:04:10.220> raveling

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
now when it comes to our raveling

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.010 
now when it comes to our raveling
further<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:13.640> kind<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.030> pull<00:04:14.360> my<00:04:14.570> hair<00:04:14.870> a

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
further I just kind of pull my hair a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.550 
further I just kind of pull my hair a
little<00:04:15.380> bit<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.620> heart<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.250> let<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.560> twist

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
little bit of heart and let the twist

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.600 
little bit of heart and let the twist
clump<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:20.110> according<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.440> how<00:04:21.650> they<00:04:21.920> want<00:04:22.250> to

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
clump out according to how they want to

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.840 
clump out according to how they want to
you<00:04:23.270> know<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.690> let<00:04:24.200> it<00:04:24.410> naturally<00:04:24.710> clump<00:04:25.580> out

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
you know I let it naturally clump out

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.870 
you know I let it naturally clump out
and<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:27.140> is<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.470> end<00:04:27.650> result<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:28.490> what<00:04:28.550> it

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
and this is the end result of what it

00:04:28.880 --> 00:05:05.640 
and this is the end result of what it
looks<00:04:29.150> like<00:04:29.360> after<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.930> is<00:04:30.110> done

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.500 

so<00:05:06.650> I'll<00:05:06.740> just<00:05:06.920> prop<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.370> back<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:08.270> just

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
so I'll just prop the back to just

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
so I'll just prop the back to just
either<00:05:08.780> parts<00:05:09.740> any<00:05:10.010> parts<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.580> see<00:05:10.610> there

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
either parts any parts that I see there

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.670 
either parts any parts that I see there
and<00:05:12.530> just<00:05:13.430> shake<00:05:13.640> shake<00:05:13.850> shake<00:05:14.230> for<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.380> side

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
and just shake shake shake for the side

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680 
and just shake shake shake for the side
you<00:05:16.130> just<00:05:16.250> want<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.610> brush<00:05:16.820> a<00:05:17.060> little<00:05:17.360> bit<00:05:17.600> of
