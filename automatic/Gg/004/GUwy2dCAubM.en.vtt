guys<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:13.349> us<00:00:13.500> as<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.700> video<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.269> him

guys for us as I do on a video with him
so<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> figured<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.470> would<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.859> most

likely<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.060> challenge<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.840> basically<00:00:19.170> you

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
likely to challenge so basically you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
likely to challenge so basically you
have<00:00:19.410> questions<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.789> will<00:00:20.910> hold<00:00:21.090> up

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
have questions and then we will hold up

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.220 
have questions and then we will hold up
our<00:00:21.330> sheets<00:00:21.949> saying<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.430> either<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.910> or
