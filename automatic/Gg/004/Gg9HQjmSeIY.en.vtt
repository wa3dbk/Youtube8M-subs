is personally my favorite zombies map

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.800 
is personally my favorite zombies map
time<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.400> took<00:02:25.520> place<00:02:25.819> on<00:02:26.000> Alcatraz<00:02:26.540> Island

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
time it took place on Alcatraz Island

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.009 
time it took place on Alcatraz Island
and<00:02:27.290> then<00:02:27.680> eventually<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.370> fly<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> plane<00:02:29.180> to

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
and then eventually you fly a plane to

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.199 
and then eventually you fly a plane to
the<00:02:30.110> Golden<00:02:30.440> Gate<00:02:30.590> Bridge<00:02:30.620> we<00:02:31.040> crash<00:02:31.489> now<00:02:32.150> we

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the Golden Gate Bridge we crash now we

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.030 
the Golden Gate Bridge we crash now we
don't<00:02:32.750> really<00:02:32.959> know<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.620> has<00:02:33.800> any

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
don't really know if this has any

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.619 
don't really know if this has any
correlation<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.060> because<00:02:35.239> when<00:02:35.540> you

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
correlation with it because when you

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.449 
correlation with it because when you
type<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.019> mob<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.440> dead<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.340> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
type in mob of the dead this is the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.979 
type in mob of the dead this is the
first<00:02:37.700> picture<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.180> comes<00:02:38.390> up<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.870> might

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
first picture that comes up it might

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.020 
first picture that comes up it might
have<00:02:39.170> nothing<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.950> with<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.280> but<00:02:40.459> then

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
have nothing to do with it but then

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.030 
have nothing to do with it but then
again<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.690> tweet<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.140> did<00:02:42.319> say<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.830> time

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
just said the next chapter so we might

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.880
