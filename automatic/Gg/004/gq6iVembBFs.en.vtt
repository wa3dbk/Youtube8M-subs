00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
even a deal-breaker but when I actually

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
even a deal-breaker but when I actually
use<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.170> device<00:01:49.380> after<00:01:49.859> a<00:01:50.100> couple<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.490> days

and the ambient light sensor is there so
that<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> when<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.459> cover<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.789> white<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that you when you cover the white for a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.649 
that you when you cover the white for a
second<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.289> turns<00:02:04.619> off<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.179> really

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
second it turns off and this was really

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.180 
second it turns off and this was really
useful<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.110> me<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.500> found<00:02:07.770> myself<00:02:07.950> using

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
useful to me and I found myself using

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.780 
useful to me and I found myself using
that<00:02:08.670> feature<00:02:08.879> quite<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> lot<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.619> because<00:02:11.400> all

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that feature quite a lot and because all

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.119 
that feature quite a lot and because all
the<00:02:12.000> bezel<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.690> one<00:02:12.959> tiny<00:02:13.200> cutout<00:02:13.680> you

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
the bezel is in one tiny cutout you

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.699 
the bezel is in one tiny cutout you
can't<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:15.000> sweet<00:02:15.269> looking<00:02:15.629> device<00:02:16.019> that

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
can't a really sweet looking device that

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.500 
can't a really sweet looking device that

every day I'm less with about 40% of

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.190 
every day I'm less with about 40% of
battery<00:04:58.100> life<00:04:58.280> which<00:04:58.790> is<00:04:59.000> not<00:04:59.030> bad<00:04:59.600> at<00:04:59.750> all<00:04:59.930> and

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
battery life which is not bad at all and

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.590 
battery life which is not bad at all and
if<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.070> really<00:05:01.460> wanted<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:01.940> push<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.390> battery

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
if I really wanted to push the battery

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.320 
if I really wanted to push the battery
it<00:05:03.200> can<00:05:03.410> probably<00:05:03.680> last<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.190> day<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.640> half<00:05:04.820> or

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
it can probably last a day and a half or

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.920 
it can probably last a day and a half or
even<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:07.190> charging<00:05:07.729> dock<00:05:07.910> is<00:05:08.150> amazing

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
even to the charging dock is amazing

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.610 
even to the charging dock is amazing
also

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
also

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.040 
also
so<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:09.979> Moto<00:05:10.220> 360<00:05:10.880> has<00:05:11.090> wireless<00:05:11.690> charging

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
so the Moto 360 has wireless charging

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.710 
so the Moto 360 has wireless charging
capability<00:05:12.860> so<00:05:13.400> all<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.640> have<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.060> do<00:05:14.210> is<00:05:14.450> just

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
capability so all I have to do is just

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.840 
capability so all I have to do is just
rest<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.260> on<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.470> dock<00:05:15.710> besides<00:05:16.100> my<00:05:16.250> bed<00:05:16.520> and

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
rest it on the dock besides my bed and

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.090 
rest it on the dock besides my bed and
this<00:05:17.180> great<00:05:17.510> autumn<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:18.050> feed<00:05:18.289> ends<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:18.860> it

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
this great autumn a feed ends and it

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.770 
this great autumn a feed ends and it
lightly<00:05:19.340> shows<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:19.850> battery<00:05:20.030> percentage<00:05:20.660> and

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
lightly shows the battery percentage and

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.170 
lightly shows the battery percentage and
the<00:05:20.930> time<00:05:21.169> which<00:05:21.979> i<00:05:22.190> think<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.640> a<00:05:22.669> handy

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
the time which i think is a handy

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.719 
the time which i think is a handy
implementation<00:05:24.140> so<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.800> give<00:05:25.190> props<00:05:25.490> to

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
implementation so I give props to

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.630 
implementation so I give props to
Motorola<00:05:26.120> for<00:05:26.479> that<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:27.560> to<00:05:27.620> wrap<00:05:28.100> it<00:05:28.160> up<00:05:28.400> the

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
Motorola for that so to wrap it up the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.420 
Motorola for that so to wrap it up the
Moto<00:05:28.850> 360<00:05:29.600> basically<00:05:30.260> represents<00:05:30.890> where<00:05:31.310> the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
Moto 360 basically represents where the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.240 
Moto 360 basically represents where the
SmartWatch<00:05:31.910> as<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.210> category<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.140> right<00:05:33.410> now<00:05:33.590> to
