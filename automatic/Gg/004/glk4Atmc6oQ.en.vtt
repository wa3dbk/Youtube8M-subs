00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
at the xbox 360 version which sadly has

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.910 
at the xbox 360 version which sadly has

so<00:00:37.760> is<00:00:37.910> slightly<00:00:38.390> stretched<00:00:38.870> but<00:00:39.350> does<00:00:39.620> give<00:00:39.860> a

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
so is slightly stretched but does give a

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.650 
so is slightly stretched but does give a
fair<00:00:40.310> representation<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:41.210> how<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.390> game

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
fair representation of how the game

fair representation of how the game
looks<00:00:41.690> in<00:00:42.140> its<00:00:42.320> native<00:00:43.030> 720p<00:00:44.260> now<00:00:45.260> we<00:00:45.320> can

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
looks in its native 720p now we can

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.230 
looks in its native 720p now we can
switch<00:00:45.710> over<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.190> xbox<00:00:46.520> one<00:00:46.820> version

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
xbox one console as you can clearly see

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.130 
xbox one console as you can clearly see
there<00:00:52.640> are<00:00:52.730> some<00:00:53.000> differences<00:00:53.240> in<00:00:53.660> lighting

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
there are some differences in lighting

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.110 
there are some differences in lighting
and<00:00:54.320> sharpness<00:00:54.740> but<00:00:55.310> also<00:00:55.490> a<00:00:55.640> lot<00:00:55.940> more

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
and sharpness but also a lot more

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.330 
and sharpness but also a lot more
movement<00:00:56.600> among<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.050> trees<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.560> materials

movement among the trees and materials

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.400 
movement among the trees and materials
but<00:00:58.970> is<00:00:59.150> it<00:00:59.300> enough<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.750> an<00:00:59.840> upgrade<00:01:00.200> to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
but is it enough of an upgrade to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.170 
but is it enough of an upgrade to
warrant<00:01:00.829> rushing<00:01:01.160> out<00:01:01.310> to<00:01:01.340> play<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.820> game<00:01:01.970> on
