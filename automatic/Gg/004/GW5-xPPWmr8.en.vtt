00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.900
 the whole game now you are going to see the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.490
 only chance that my rival will have in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.779
 the whole damn long ball game that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.160
 they throw him down and that in Harry who 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.109
 that is going to try to throw that there is 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.179
 covering walker and against the touch it just 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.410
 plan so that the wall next to the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.030
 guys, it's all right 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.410
 Now you are going to see how I'm going to start 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.059
 touch the boys actively study 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.110
 playing a lot to the touch looking for spaces 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.340
 and how are you seeing structure is 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.079
 trying to look for gaps 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.059
 chokes and well here now 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 same as having very shy shot 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.320
 de yaya touré that pays without problems 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.550
 courtois but good you see that I am 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.840
 all the time to attack good for was 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 found in this well there must come and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.850
 mariah for the lack of di Maria way 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.210
 Shooting 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 where are you courtois basic up here for 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.239
 where my mother culture 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.860
 incredible guys the paradón that 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.750
 he took out but it's good football and the goalkeeper 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.699
 he also plays let's make a corner there 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.350
 as you see it erred in the corner I already 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.700
 see guys see what I will do my 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.530
 rival and that is what they do throughout 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.450
 party tries to leave and steals them musicians 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.340
 it does not even reach the center of the omen field 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.960
 good that made for yaya touré yaya 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.970
 I toured the game a square square 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.030
 the sheet with some shoots 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.350
 stops courtois again at point-blank 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.150
 al kun aguero that that always gets him 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.620
 but good thing said the goalkeeper also 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.840
 he plays is very rare that he has two 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.550
 paradons followed but good does not end 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.470
 that the thing that I already had faces the area 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.430
 of the game for running only for 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.560
 of half dimon since I was going to paste 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.390
 shoot from maría good good good 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.680
 It is an opportunity to plan very 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.820
 clear in plan that the disparate action 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.260
 last but let's see what it is that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.670
 happens in this corner 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.840
 today we see that I see clichy I'm going to do 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 the play until I like doing so much 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.910
 from the crescent of the area we miss 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.270
 so that the chichi lichi that controls her 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.960
 he beats mother will catch me from cult game 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.880
 stops courtois again there the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.299
 thing I smelled quite a bed 28 stops in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.159
 32 minutes mine had made three the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.140
 true how amazing because those three 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.409
 stops I still think two were tech 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.299
 tips 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.799
 head sessions but good we're going to 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.509
 see my rival that in the steals try to 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.129
 against and again passes the midfield 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.540
 but it does not pass more than 10 meters guys 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.250
 we can fix the ball we go back to 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.900
 touch the ball and again a new corner 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.879
 the extraction Maria di Maria that cha 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.980
 after ball for cliche clichy caló 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.510
 popular pointed out we are already removing the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.799
 part of me, there come try 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.090
 As you can see my rival was with the bus 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.910
 position was almost all the equipment 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.620
 defending and good I put the time 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.329
 trying trying trying ay 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.920
 I said come try to see what happens 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.510
 to see if what the band is already another 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.220
 history I see silva long pass for 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.579
 silva silva that as not so center of 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.230
 3x there we see and take it out with me pass the 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.099
 unbelievable guys good he has taken you out 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.110
 vital 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.430
 I have had more luck has been a 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.930
 first half part final lack of 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.540
 first game takes advantage see the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.769
 statistics but good taking my 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.180
 rival shot once brings island that 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.040
 you have seen at the beginning but good 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.930
 let's ask why you do not want 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.430
 say anything that we have failed the bad 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.120
 for the yaya touré yaya touré faces the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.920
 area 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.310
 andigital ojito that I see how it stands out 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.940
 with the kun that only fails 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.280
 to the club, it's worth it, the game was already 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.310
 to go three - goal winning it so 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.230
 least let's go 0-0 the 154 were the semis 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.760
 of the tournament which was already in semis 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.620
 I was already exposing myself to record the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.790
 final but always all the capture of the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.019
 aggravating forever it lists the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.190
 causes and a truth that was incredible 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.630
 we had watched alcohol tried and from 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.860
 new center passes it to the capo outta 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.260
 with a square a square for me 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.500
 maria di maría- paragüero show off 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.970
 from a distance to see what happens there 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.709
 the for cut through a shot that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.739
 was perfect to enter guys already 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.480
 you know that I consider myself outside 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.010
 from the area shot pretty well what 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 I practice a lot and I'm good at it 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.250
 that I called my shots alligator 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.290
 shots because they are shots that I use 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.730
 very much and it makes an incredible paradón 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 when that shot just enter almost 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.019
 always the one of robert my rival returns to 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.430
 try the contra and ojito el kun aguero 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.319
 that does not pass the filter to the field 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.549
 we go back to steal what he quoted that was the 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.080
 go back to steal and also a match in 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.340
 campus rats and not always robbed 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.840
 I went from the damn center of the field 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.720
 You see guys around me and give 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.069
 balls and was worth and start again now 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.630
 let's see a play that I tried to 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.130
 stopped ball because he was already so 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.660
 desperate I said that I do not know anymore 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.890
 what to do the ball does not enter or try 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.580
 some new thing a for de maría and 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.340
 Mary to get 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.800
 aware that you do not get whistled by 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.440
 millimeters the truth that the pass was very 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.209
 forced and such and there was nothing outside of 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.100
 normal now good because a love ojito 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.780
 omen to look and what a shame and what 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.459
 improves a little bit to her final and for 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.860
 finally shoot us there the truth that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.930
 there is nothing unusual because some gold a little 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.670
 normal heeling that the normal fault is 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.380
 human from there it was very complicated 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.390
 shot then it's worth that is completely 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.490
 understandable what I do not understand is that 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.240
 183 13 on the scoreboard with an uncle who does not 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.970
 I could play 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.040
 I repeat I did not know how to play and that's what I 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.270
 angry about this game as you are 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.310
 seeing my rival just going forward 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.990
 send to such a point that is that if a 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.640
 player is going forward was 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.440
 amazing and again again with a 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.540
 which for us now coon 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.010
 we see how marin will have against ojito 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.960
 there, what a pity that it draws me just enough to 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.550
 him that a good one arrives to us at that ball 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.560
 guys because that would have been pretty 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.690
 dangerous but good we are already ready 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.580
 as you see then at the end of the game 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.990
 but eating a tournament was missing the extension 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.520
 I was convinced that I could win 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.680
 the party because it was a party that 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.150
 I was incredibly dominating as is 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.670
 my rival just stretched the occasion of the 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.290
 first part and I do not know why I do not know 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.760
 they told me the shots because the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.030
 second part if you tell us there have been 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.070
 plus 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.450
 what brand and now we see there the kun 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.830
 augured is fine america on the 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.810
 I bet you see this statistic 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.020
 look now look at the kun aguero what's going 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.170
 to leave now there are seven shots four 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.820
 doors of only one player only 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.590
 a player taking away the ones he has outside 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.150
 of the area with other players right now 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.140
 a short to the fault there has been a 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.610
 failure had to have thrown and 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.170
 would entail because with the exterior of 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.340
 Maria or brave to the damn squadron that 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.960
 good with the luck I had in this 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.970
 party surely released the NATO 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.740
 there on or off but not the rival that 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.420
 militates the ball now will end the 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.470
 first part of the extension a first 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.820
 part that there were no occasions the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.290
 second there were not many occasions but 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.090
 let's put the most important thing as 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.160
 see the shots that did not add me and 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.900
 let's go to the crucial part of this match 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.610
 another new against again have the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.990
 ball not know where to go min 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.460
 I was not doing anything anyway 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.660
 convinced that he could score but 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.250
 is that I was watching the penalties so 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.230
 I was close and scaring me 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.760
 steal good there is an error of mine and look at the 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.110
 lucky that has rebound that gives my 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.310
 defense throws it up I do not know why my 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.890
 team was so match ball for 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.390
 harry kings hits him there and he hits me 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.830
 I put goal an uncle that not activating 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.960
 Match wins and over with two balls 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.460
 he tells me to shut up because he can not play and 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.900
 says tomato because he ordered to shut up because 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.030
 I know not how I got you and that please 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.699
 they are not doing anything please that 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.320
 it's shared a little uncle but it's 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.580
 amazing how you 've seen a game that 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.960
 You dominated from start to finish you see now 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.880
 see the last play but while going 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.620
 to take the opportunity to comment on one thing I 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.110
 I do not want to think about the handicap is 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.030
 obvious that there is a great test here 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.680
 because this party was something shameless 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.900
 is that I finished it and I swear it was like 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.000
 been that as saying but that a 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.460
 litis has happened here is that is 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.130
 amazing a match that I earn 10 in 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.139
 the 120th minute when that party was 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.729
 to have won it 4 or 5 goals 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.680
 now you are going to see the aesthetics of 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.570
 match and is that my rival did nothing 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.280
 from the other world with the equipazo I had 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.760
 he did nothing simply one against in 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.430
 the minute 120 and a bounce from the center of the 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.620
 field and I creating triangulation game 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.580
 it is and such it removed it all the porter was going 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.139
 to the stick 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.600
 detected to know how to go eliminating the 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.560
 flirtation tournament guys and nothing just 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.970
