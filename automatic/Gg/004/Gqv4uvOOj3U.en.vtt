sequel dead island was a game that
really<00:00:06.960> did<00:00:07.259> trick<00:00:07.560> me<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.700> know<00:00:08.760> watching

the<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:10.040> trailers<00:00:11.040> guys<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> kind<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> thought

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the the trailers guys I kind of thought

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.910 
the the trailers guys I kind of thought
it<00:00:12.420> would<00:00:12.599> be<00:00:12.690> more<00:00:12.870> emotional<00:00:13.170> than<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.740> was

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
it would be more emotional than it was

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
it would be more emotional than it was
but<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.280> did<00:00:14.519> really<00:00:14.639> fill<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> co-op

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
but it did really fill in on the co-op

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.670 
but it did really fill in on the co-op
gameplay<00:00:15.900> even<00:00:16.080> single-player<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
gameplay even single-player the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.800 
gameplay even single-player the
exploration<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.550> I've<00:00:17.640> always<00:00:17.789> looked<00:00:18.029> for

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
exploration that I've always looked for

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330 
exploration that I've always looked for
