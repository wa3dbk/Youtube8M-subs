procedure<00:01:46.939> is<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.659> procedure<00:01:47.810> where<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.619> skin

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
procedure is a procedure where the skin

procedure is a procedure where the skin
the<00:01:49.460> earlobe<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.509> actually<00:01:50.810> detached<00:01:51.229> and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the earlobe is actually detached and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.569 
the earlobe is actually detached and
sutured<00:01:52.700> in<00:01:53.119> an<00:01:53.390> inward<00:01:54.020> way<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.920> the

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
sutured in an inward way so that the

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.300 
sutured in an inward way so that the
it's<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.240> little<00:01:56.329> bit<00:01:56.539> rounded<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's a little bit rounded and that the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.149 
it's a little bit rounded and that the
defect<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.090> basically<00:01:59.570> closed<00:02:00.109> it<00:02:00.649> does<00:02:00.920> leave

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
defect is basically closed it does leave

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.670 
defect is basically closed it does leave
a<00:02:01.189> little<00:02:01.460> bit<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.880> scar<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.509> my<00:02:03.109> practice

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
a little bit of a scar in my practice

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.859 
a little bit of a scar in my practice
when<00:02:04.219> people<00:02:04.609> have<00:02:04.729> come<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.149> me<00:02:05.180> with<00:02:05.479> pixie

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
when people have come to me with pixie

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.499 
when people have come to me with pixie
ear<00:02:06.049> deformities<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:07.039> lot<00:02:07.969> of<00:02:08.119> them<00:02:08.270> actually

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
ear deformities a lot of them actually

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.440 
ear deformities a lot of them actually
came<00:02:09.020> with<00:02:09.320> very<00:02:09.350> loose<00:02:10.009> skin<00:02:10.429> as<00:02:10.729> well<00:02:11.090> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
came with very loose skin as well and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.500 
came with very loose skin as well and
they<00:02:12.230> had<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.740> over<00:02:13.400> tightening<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.210> this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
they had just over tightening in this

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.010 
they had just over tightening in this
area<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.310> when<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.340> lifted<00:02:17.090> them<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.780> whole

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
area and when I lifted them up the whole

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.960 
area and when I lifted them up the whole
skin<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.620> everything<00:02:18.800> else<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.340> I've

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
skin and everything else and I've

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.240 
skin and everything else and I've
attached<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.750> earlobe<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.710> different<00:02:22.070> way

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
attached the earlobe in a different way

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
attached the earlobe in a different way
that<00:02:23.090> resolved<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.720> problem<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.170> improved

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
that resolved the problem and improved

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.680 
that resolved the problem and improved
their<00:02:24.740> facelift<00:02:25.280> as<00:02:25.490> well<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:26.570> isn't

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
their facelift as well so there isn't

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.050 
their facelift as well so there isn't
one<00:02:27.080> generic<00:02:27.890> approach<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.640> there<00:02:28.850> is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
one generic approach but there is

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.440 
one generic approach but there is
certainly<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:31.450> minimally<00:02:34.030> involved<00:02:35.030> approach

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
certainly a minimally involved approach

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.730 
certainly a minimally involved approach
to<00:02:35.810> fixing<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.500> pixie<00:02:36.830> ear<00:02:37.040> deformity

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
to fixing a pixie ear deformity

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.850 
to fixing a pixie ear deformity
this<00:02:39.250> also<00:02:39.490> depends<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.060> lot<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.270> how<00:02:40.480> far<00:02:41.290> along

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
this also depends a lot on how far along

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.820 
this also depends a lot on how far along
you<00:02:42.190> are<00:02:42.400> from<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.150> surgery<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.960> it's

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
you are from your surgery and it's

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.070 
you are from your surgery and it's
something<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> discuss<00:02:45.700> with<00:02:45.970> your<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
something to discuss with your the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.070 
something to discuss with your the
surgeon<00:02:47.470> who<00:02:47.620> did<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.950> say<00:02:48.190> your<00:02:48.580> procedure

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
surgeon who did you say your procedure

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.610 
surgeon who did you say your procedure
so<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.970> guess<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.750> way<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.020> summarize

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
so the I guess the the way to summarize

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.590 
so the I guess the the way to summarize
this<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.130> there<00:02:54.490> could<00:02:54.670> be<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:55.180> straightforward

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
this is there could be a straightforward

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.670 
this is there could be a straightforward
simple<00:02:56.320> procedure<00:02:57.600> with<00:02:58.600> an<00:02:58.720> exchange<00:02:58.960> of<00:02:59.530> a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
simple procedure with an exchange of a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.040 
simple procedure with an exchange of a
certain<00:03:00.070> amount<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.550> type<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.180> scarring<00:03:01.510> that

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
certain amount of type of scarring that

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.130 
certain amount of type of scarring that
can<00:03:02.410> be<00:03:02.590> camouflaged<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:03.730> allowed<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.900> heal

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
can be camouflaged and allowed to heal

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.640 
can be camouflaged and allowed to heal
nicely<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.970> not<00:03:07.240> be<00:03:07.420> obvious<00:03:07.660> or<00:03:08.170> it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
nicely and and not be obvious or it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.340 
nicely and and not be obvious or it
could<00:03:08.800> be<00:03:08.920> more<00:03:09.130> extensive<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.900> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
could be more extensive so that the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.490 
could be more extensive so that the
global<00:03:12.340> issue<00:03:12.610> related<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.690> pixie<00:03:14.350> ear

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
global issue related to the pixie ear

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000 
global issue related to the pixie ear
deformity<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:16.360> little<00:03:16.750> bit<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:17.200> lifting

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
deformity is a little bit more lifting

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.670 
deformity is a little bit more lifting
involved<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:18.880> order<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.540> reduce<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.170> downward

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
involved in order to reduce the downward

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.390 
involved in order to reduce the downward
pull<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.940> earlobe<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.770> hope<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.280> was

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
pull on the earlobe so I hope that was

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.220 
pull on the earlobe so I hope that was
helpful<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.030> thank<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.990> for<00:03:26.140> your
