looks like yeah but this is what's on
the<00:01:58.870> ground<00:01:59.490> okay<00:02:00.490> well<00:02:00.790> now<00:02:00.910> if<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.240> just

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
the ground okay well now if you just

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.180 
the ground okay well now if you just
scratch<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.020> soil<00:02:02.290> that's<00:02:02.500> what<00:02:02.680> comes<00:02:02.980> out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
scratch the soil that's what comes out

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.480 
scratch the soil that's what comes out
so<00:02:03.430> it's<00:02:03.550> all<00:02:03.760> looks<00:02:04.000> like<00:02:04.150> that<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.190> then<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
so it's all looks like that and then the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.279 
so it's all looks like that and then the
end<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.730> roots<00:02:06.970> they<00:02:07.180> go<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.660> they<00:02:07.750> take

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
end the roots they go in and they take

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.020 
end the roots they go in and they take
all<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> rules<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.399> rock<00:02:09.610> growing

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
all the rules it's a rock growing

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.390 
all the rules it's a rock growing
because<00:02:10.300> there's<00:02:10.690> still<00:02:10.989> all<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.400> humidity

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
because there's still all the humidity

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.850 
because there's still all the humidity
the<00:02:13.120> whole<00:02:13.269> thing<00:02:13.540> drives<00:02:13.989> out<00:02:14.260> completely

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the whole thing drives out completely

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.830 
the whole thing drives out completely
but<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.400> between<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:16.120> your<00:02:16.239> moisture<00:02:16.629> come

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
but in between it's your moisture come

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.899 
but in between it's your moisture come
together<00:02:17.290> with<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.739> with<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.069> roots<00:02:18.400> there's

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
together with it with the roots there's

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.729 
together with it with the roots there's
something<00:02:19.360> growing<00:02:19.569> so<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.379> just<00:02:20.560> be

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
together with the root rocks are able to

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.750 
together with the root rocks are able to
trap<00:02:22.870> moisture<00:02:23.200> giving<00:02:23.950> these<00:02:24.099> wines<00:02:24.430> a
