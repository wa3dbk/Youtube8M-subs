00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so don't worry if if they have them

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
so don't worry if if they have them
while<00:01:22.710> they're<00:01:22.890> trying<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> fall<00:01:23.580> asleep<00:01:23.610> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
while they're trying to fall asleep in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.620 
while they're trying to fall asleep in
bed<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.540> it'll<00:01:24.810> break<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:27.360> won't

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
bed that it'll break up and it won't

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.130 
bed that it'll break up and it won't
it's<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.439> sealed<00:01:28.829> tightly<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.930> all

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it's it's sealed tightly so I have all

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.730 
it's it's sealed tightly so I have all
the<00:01:31.229> materials<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> show<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the materials here I want to show you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.719 
the materials here I want to show you
essentially<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.920> need<00:01:35.070> two<00:01:35.310> different

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
essentially you need two different

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.020 
essentially you need two different
weights<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.180> glitter<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.759> way

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
weights of glitter and the first way

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
weights of glitter and the first way
that<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.450> put<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> very<00:01:40.380> fine<00:01:40.829> glitter

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that you put in is a very fine glitter

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
that you put in is a very fine glitter
and<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.509> got<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:44.509> really<00:01:45.509> really

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and it's got to be really really really

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.140 
and it's got to be really really really
fine<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.280> takes<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.670> long

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
fine so that it takes a long

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.410 
fine so that it takes a long
time<00:01:48.300> for<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.050> glitter<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:50.120> fall<00:01:51.120> down

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
time for the glitter to fall down

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.980 
time for the glitter to fall down
through<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> jar<00:01:53.240> okay<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.930> don't

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
through the jar okay and and I don't

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.880 
through the jar okay and and I don't
have<00:01:55.500> specific<00:01:57.020> measurements<00:01:58.020> I've<00:01:58.260> done<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
have specific measurements I've done a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.280 
have specific measurements I've done a
ton<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.220> these<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.880> I've<00:02:00.000> never<00:02:00.540> I've<00:02:00.960> always

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
ton of these but I've never I've always

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.070 
ton of these but I've never I've always
just<00:02:01.320> done<00:02:01.760> done<00:02:02.760> this<00:02:04.430> visually<00:02:05.900> figure<00:02:06.900> it

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
just done done this visually figure it

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.430 
just done done this visually figure it
out

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
out

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.100 
out
so<00:02:07.650> first<00:02:08.190> thing<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.580> goes<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.869> very

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so first thing that goes in is the very

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.990 
so first thing that goes in is the very
fine<00:02:10.530> weight<00:02:11.570> of<00:02:12.570> glitter<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.730> little<00:02:14.730> bit<00:02:14.850> more

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
fine weight of glitter a little bit more

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520 
fine weight of glitter a little bit more
in<00:02:15.180> there<00:02:15.420> okay

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
in there okay

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.250 
in there okay
and<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:18.060> you're<00:02:18.510> gonna<00:02:18.660> need<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.960> little

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and then you're gonna need a little

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.230 
and then you're gonna need a little
heavier<00:02:19.740> weight<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.120> know

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
of the heavier weight layer and then

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
of the heavier weight layer and then
just<00:02:28.740> for<00:02:28.950> fun<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.790> add<00:02:30.200> another<00:02:34.100> size
