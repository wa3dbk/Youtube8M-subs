00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello I'll show you how to get in today 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.710
 such could you go element 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.270
 For example, a lot of fucking good 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.850
 the art is used for the instruction 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.510
 i give respect to rilana and one 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.430
 with the meter there must keep the left 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.780
 to that he finds in the description and 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:31.160
 the youtube here or on the website 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 probably also served with 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:44.780
 make one sharp in the long 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.159
 drive underneath and see the long one 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.559
 rides through that results in an opening 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.559
 the hook 41 arrives 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.690
 this is our first club and now 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.390
 we will air sometimes begrudge to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.200
 Let's get the thread on the hard and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.220
 These tough through the mesh by the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.960
 gives called again some demons 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.380
 pull through 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:20.720
 We'll do that so often until we die 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.060
 necessary length for our scarf or for 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.409
 the element you would like to go 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 is reached and then it continues 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.549
 if your air masses are long enough 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.810
 we can do this back and though in 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.280
 strong stitches 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.560
 of course that shows it right back 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.740
 go or be with the whole 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.170
 make and indeed with triple to 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.439
 that means we will be three solid 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 crochet the stitches in a stitch and go 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.439
 a solid mesh first we czech 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.030
 from the hook to the second as I do 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.399
 here comes from the first already something 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.110
 that's why the second loves it 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.850
 then we want that through the whole 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.149
 mesh through have two teams 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.600
 hagen driving through the two 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.000
 pull 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.310
 this results in a solid mesh and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.180
 the same opening now comes two more 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 more in the same opening 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.940
 pierce thread we pull 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.319
 again our two bottles of fade live 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.000
 through the two see that now the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.500
 second feast , for example, the same opening 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.150
 and now the third solid mesh 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.860
 go through this as we have 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.569
 now in a mesh three in it and that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.489
 we will now with each other 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:47.470
 So make mesh in the same way 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:51.400
 next mesh only the second branch 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.959
 and the third fake and you see 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.019
 already it starts to be on 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.060
 drink all that was with me 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:03.099
 next laundry also first fixed mesh 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.220
 second face for example occurs the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.260
 window and we do so until the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.569
 finish until we all go 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.700
 ready as far as they are already so 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.549
 out and in the second row if we 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.200
 do now following it is his 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.359
 make air mass that is practically the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.829
 will then turn the work 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:32.889
 and now we will be two in each ashes 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:37.590
 Clean solid knitted as a first 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.590
 possible, and then it goes a long 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:59.860
 121 and the whole thing again until the end 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:08.379
 and then you can decide if 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.330
 you wanted to have the whole thing even thicker 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:17.060
 there could be rhythm either 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.609
 maintain or reduce or do that 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.739
 have left so completely like you 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.260
 want to, we cry for you that 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.450
 or the right element you guys that 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.510
 but that's probably the principle 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.870
 Nobody to create a kind of accounts 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.870
 can
