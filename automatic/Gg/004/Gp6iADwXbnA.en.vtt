00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
freestyle and stuff down to the writing

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.389 
freestyle and stuff down to the writing
styles<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.380> say<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.770> board<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.100> probably

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
styles and say this board is probably

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.150 
styles and say this board is probably
best<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.670> sliding<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.270> downhill<00:02:03.649> because<00:02:05.750> it

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
best for sliding or downhill because it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.790 
best for sliding or downhill because it
blocks<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.340> feeling<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.970> slide<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
blocks your feeling for a slide and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
blocks your feeling for a slide and
downhill<00:02:10.800> also<00:02:11.099> locks<00:02:11.250> your<00:02:11.340> fee<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> also<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
downhill also locks your fee in also the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.330 
downhill also locks your fee in also the
stability<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.410> push<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.010> ball<00:02:14.220> is

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
stability and push on this ball is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.369 
stability and push on this ball is
really<00:02:14.640> good<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.720> get<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> lot<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.080> speed

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
really good you can get a lot of speed

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.920 
really good you can get a lot of speed
for<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.620> slide<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:18.090> lot<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.300> speed<00:02:18.510> down<00:02:18.720> here

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
for a slide and a lot of speed down here

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.050 
for a slide and a lot of speed down here
as<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.379> really<00:02:19.650> long<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.580> lock<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:20.879> feet

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
as it's really long can lock your feet

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.500 
as it's really long can lock your feet
in<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:22.800> carving<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> cruising<00:02:23.700> I'd<00:02:23.970> say<00:02:24.360> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
in for carving and cruising I'd say it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.210 
in for carving and cruising I'd say it's
boards<00:02:25.459> probably<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:27.720> alright<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.410> wouldn't

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
boards probably it's alright I wouldn't

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.119 
boards probably it's alright I wouldn't
like<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> long<00:02:30.390> straight<00:02:30.840> road<00:02:30.980> which<00:02:31.980> is

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
like on a long straight road which is

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.600 
like on a long straight road which is
