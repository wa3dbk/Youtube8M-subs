00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Belgium probably not against the odds

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.190 
Belgium probably not against the odds
they<00:00:36.059> were<00:00:36.120> firm<00:00:36.480> favourite<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.959 
they were firm favourite to get on the
podium<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:38.430> gonna<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> little<00:00:38.820> bit

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
podium but it's gonna be a little bit

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
podium but it's gonna be a little bit
more<00:00:39.090> difficult<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.540> him<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
more difficult for him to do it here on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
more difficult for him to do it here on
home<00:00:40.680> soil<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.700> Marcus<00:00:42.329> ship<00:00:42.480> whose

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629

stronger<00:00:44.160> riders<00:00:44.489> who<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> good<00:00:45.690> anchor

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
stronger riders who was a good anchor

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750
