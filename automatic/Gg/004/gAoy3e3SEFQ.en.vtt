people<00:00:05.700> think<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.120> these<00:00:06.299> nerves<00:00:06.660> are

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
people think that these nerves are

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.629 
people think that these nerves are
really<00:00:07.440> bad<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.950> they<00:00:08.040> really<00:00:08.400> aren't

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
really bad and they really aren't

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.870 
really bad and they really aren't
they're<00:00:09.530> somewhat<00:00:10.530> bad<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.580> just<00:00:11.790> shows

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
they're somewhat bad but it just shows

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820 
they're somewhat bad but it just shows
that<00:00:12.059> infinity<00:00:12.630> ward<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> against<00:00:13.440> sniping

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that infinity ward is against sniping

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
that infinity ward is against sniping
and<00:00:13.950> trickshotting<00:00:14.400> mainly<00:00:15.210> because<00:00:15.360> ever

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and trickshotting mainly because ever

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
and trickshotting mainly because ever
since<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.740> release<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.250> ghosts<00:00:17.490> they've

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
since the release of ghosts they've

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.660 
since the release of ghosts they've
added<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.990> many<00:00:19.350> things<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.220> just

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.849 
added so many things that have just
tried<00:00:20.939> nerfing<00:00:21.570> sniping<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.500> trickshotting

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
tried nerfing sniping and trickshotting

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.980 
tried nerfing sniping and trickshotting
for<00:00:23.310> good<00:00:23.519> they've<00:00:23.789> tried<00:00:24.029> actually<00:00:24.660> taking

the<00:00:29.039> description<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.939> guys<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.330> read<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the description you guys can read the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.930 
the description you guys can read the
first<00:00:30.840> three<00:00:30.929> bullets<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.500> me<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.759> first

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
first three bullets with me the first

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.970 
first three bullets with me the first
bullet<00:00:33.270> says<00:00:33.660> no<00:00:33.960> Amos<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> hip<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
bullet says no Amos is from the hip and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.010 
bullet says no Amos is from the hip and
all<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.090> three<00:00:36.300> bullets<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.780> from

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
all these first three bullets are from

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
all these first three bullets are from
when<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.230> first<00:00:37.260> released<00:00:38.219> ghosts<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.850> we

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
when they first released ghosts so we

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180 
when they first released ghosts so we
were<00:00:39.090> able<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.390> overcome<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.410> now

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
were able to overcome these and now

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.799 
were able to overcome these and now
they're<00:00:41.460> actually<00:00:41.610> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.180> add<00:00:42.329> more

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
they're actually going to add more

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.680 
they're actually going to add more
nerves<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.890> makes<00:00:44.129> no<00:00:44.399> sense<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:44.940> but

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
nerves which makes no sense to me but

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
nerves which makes no sense to me but
they<00:00:45.899> basically<00:00:46.079> made<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.010> there's<00:00:47.190> no<00:00:47.309> aim

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
they basically made it so there's no aim

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
they basically made it so there's no aim
assist<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> hip<00:00:48.090> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> huge<00:00:48.899> part

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
assist from the hip which is a huge part

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520 
assist from the hip which is a huge part
of<00:00:49.260> how<00:00:49.350> quickscoping<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:51.570> easy<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
of how quickscoping was not easy but it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.819 
of how quickscoping was not easy but it
made<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.250> easier<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.699> quick<00:00:54.030> scoping

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
made a lot easier for quick scoping

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.049 
made a lot easier for quick scoping
hipfire<00:00:55.829> ridicules<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.460> sniper<00:00:56.640> rifles<00:00:56.969> were

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
hipfire ridicules for sniper rifles were

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
hipfire ridicules for sniper rifles were
removed<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> hip<00:00:57.750> spread<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.170> increased

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
removed and hip spread was increased

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.279 
removed and hip spread was increased
drastically<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.180> mitt<00:01:00.359> basically<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
drastically so this mitt basically is a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
drastically so this mitt basically is a
bullet<00:01:01.620> against<00:01:02.399> trickshotting<00:01:03.019> completely

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
bullet against trickshotting completely

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
bullet against trickshotting completely
they're<00:01:04.559> trying<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.369> extremely<00:01:05.939> hard

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
they're trying to make it extremely hard

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.789 
they're trying to make it extremely hard
for<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.479> hit<00:01:06.659> no<00:01:06.810> scopes<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
for your hit no scopes and it is a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.200 
for your hit no scopes and it is a
little<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.130> harder<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.520> hit<00:01:08.610> no<00:01:08.760> scopes<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
little bit harder to hit no scopes and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.429 
little bit harder to hit no scopes and
cod<00:01:09.330> ghosts<00:01:09.630> unless<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.409> at

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
cod ghosts unless you're really good at

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.100 
cod ghosts unless you're really good at
trickshotting<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.150> Cottrell<00:01:12.510> perk<00:01:12.869> aim

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
trickshotting and the Cottrell perk aim

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.539 
trickshotting and the Cottrell perk aim
down<00:01:13.290> sight<00:01:13.560> speed<00:01:13.830> skill<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.250> reduced

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
down sight speed skill was reduced

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.070 
down sight speed skill was reduced
significantly<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> sniper<00:01:15.479> rifle<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.990> they

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
significantly for a sniper rifle so they

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.399 
significantly for a sniper rifle so they
made<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> harder<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.640> min<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
made it harder for you to a min and that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.130 
made it harder for you to a min and that
made<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> lot<00:01:19.920> harder<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> quickscope

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
made a lot harder for you to quickscope

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.200 
made a lot harder for you to quickscope
but<00:01:22.140> Infinity<00:01:22.890> Ward<00:01:23.100> said<00:01:23.460> oh<00:01:23.640> yeah<00:01:24.000> we're

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
but Infinity Ward said oh yeah we're

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.340 
but Infinity Ward said oh yeah we're
going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> nerf<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.720> again<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
going to nerf you again because you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
going to nerf you again because you
overcame<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.210> they're<00:01:27.240> doing

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
overcame that so now what they're doing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
overcame that so now what they're doing
is<00:01:27.689> they're<00:01:27.720> making<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> reduction<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
is they're making a reduction in the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
is they're making a reduction in the
flinch<00:01:29.130> benefit<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> focus<00:01:30.270> perk<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
flinch benefit of the focus perk and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.530 
flinch benefit of the focus perk and
increase<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.470> overall<00:01:31.590> 80s<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> sniper

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
increase in overall 80s time and sniper

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
increase in overall 80s time and sniper
rifles<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.079> silence<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.500> being<00:01:34.770> changed<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
rifles with silence are being changed to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.120 
rifles with silence are being changed to
a<00:01:35.400> chest<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.150> kill<00:01:36.630> instead<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> waist<00:01:37.860> up

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
a chest up kill instead of a waist up

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
a chest up kill instead of a waist up
kill<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:38.640> makes<00:01:38.909> no<00:01:39.240> sense<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.900> because

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
kill which makes no sense to me because

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.249 
kill which makes no sense to me because
to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.979> honest<00:01:41.780> sniper<00:01:42.780> rifles<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
to be honest sniper rifles with a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
to be honest sniper rifles with a
silencer<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> many<00:01:44.250> people<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
silencer not that many people use in the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.399 
silencer not that many people use in the
first<00:01:45.060> place<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> guess<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:45.899> people<00:01:45.960> did

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
first place now I guess more people did

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.569 
first place now I guess more people did
start<00:01:46.439> using<00:01:46.860> them<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.159> ghost<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
start using them and ghost because I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.310 
start using them and ghost because I
actually<00:01:47.939> sell<00:01:48.360> them<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.750> more<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> ghost

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
actually sell them a lot more and ghost

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.010 
actually sell them a lot more and ghost
so<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:50.700> might<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> reasons<00:01:51.689> but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
so that might be one of the reasons but

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.200 
so that might be one of the reasons but
they're<00:01:52.470> also<00:01:52.649> trying<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.280> reduce<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> flinch

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
they're also trying to reduce the flinch

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
they're also trying to reduce the flinch
benefit<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> focus<00:01:55.259> perk<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:56.159> means

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
benefit of the focus perk which means

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.100 
benefit of the focus perk which means
that<00:01:56.820> when<00:01:57.000> once<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> try<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> quickscope

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that when once you try to quickscope

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
that when once you try to quickscope
someone<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.560> miss<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.130> someone<00:01:59.399> starts

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
someone you miss and someone starts

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
someone you miss and someone starts
shooting<00:01:59.850> at<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:01.049> you're<00:02:01.229> basically

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
shooting at you then you're basically

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
shooting at you then you're basically
fucked<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:02.729> not<00:02:02.850> there's<00:02:03.180> no<00:02:03.299> aim

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
fucked because you're not there's no aim

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.120 
fucked because you're not there's no aim

assist from the hip anymore so you're

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
assist from the hip anymore so you're
not<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.549> able<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.909> aim<00:02:06.210> right<00:02:06.570> onto

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
not going to be able to aim right onto

not going to be able to aim right onto
the<00:02:06.960> person<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.799> completely<00:02:08.310> fucked

do<00:03:04.940> when<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.210> rag<00:03:05.480> on<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.840> actually<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.440> lot

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
do when you rag on it actually is a lot

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.500 
do when you rag on it actually is a lot
harder<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.190> snipe<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.030> reason<00:03:08.330> why

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
harder to snipe and the reason why

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.050 
harder to snipe and the reason why
people<00:03:08.900> will<00:03:09.680> actually<00:03:09.860> snipe<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.670> because

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
people will actually snipe is because

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.550 
people will actually snipe is because
they<00:03:11.150> want<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.360> show<00:03:11.600> off<00:03:11.810> how<00:03:12.140> much<00:03:12.320> better

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560

across the map shooting people which is
honestly<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.690> lot<00:03:26.930> more<00:03:27.140> annoying<00:03:27.500> than<00:03:27.740> having

be trying to make the game more
realistic<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.860> they<00:03:43.280> shouldn't<00:03:43.550> be<00:03:43.610> giving

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
little bit easier once you're really go

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.230 
little bit easier once you're really go
to<00:03:59.120> call<00:03:59.330> of<00:03:59.420> duty<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.810> be<00:03:59.930> able<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.230> snipe<00:04:00.470> but

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
fairly well in a game alright it takes

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.420 
fairly well in a game alright it takes
hours<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.320> hours<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.680> do<00:04:06.770> fairly<00:04:07.040> well<00:04:07.160> with<00:04:07.310> a

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
hours and hours to do fairly well with a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.970 
hours and hours to do fairly well with a
sniper<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:07.850> quick<00:04:08.180> scope<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.630> really<00:04:09.380> does<00:04:09.620> any

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
sniper in quick scope it really does any

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.920 
sniper in quick scope it really does any
new<00:04:10.280> who<00:04:10.520> plays<00:04:10.790> call<00:04:11.150> duty<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.600> actually

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
new who plays call duty it actually

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.720 
new who plays call duty it actually
takes<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.200> long<00:04:12.470> time<00:04:12.500> that's<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.340> reason<00:04:13.610> why<00:04:13.700> a

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
takes a long time that's a reason why a

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.550 
takes a long time that's a reason why a
lot<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.090> us<00:04:14.330> went<00:04:14.630> into<00:04:14.900> quickscoping<00:04:15.440> or

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
lot of us went into quickscoping or

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.530 
lot of us went into quickscoping or
whatever<00:04:15.770> sniping<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.430> trickshotting<00:04:17.390> is

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
whatever sniping and trickshotting is

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.970 
whatever sniping and trickshotting is
because<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.840> was<00:04:17.930> harder<00:04:18.290> than<00:04:18.320> everything

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
because it was harder than everything

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.220 
because it was harder than everything
else<00:04:19.280> we<00:04:20.060> took<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.570> as<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.720> challenge<00:04:20.810> we

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
else we took it as a challenge we

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.600 
else we took it as a challenge we
overcame<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:21.950> that's<00:04:22.130> why<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.490> many

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
overcame it and that's why so many

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.340 
overcame it and that's why so many
people<00:04:22.669> are<00:04:22.910> good<00:04:23.150> at<00:04:23.180> quickscoping<00:04:23.479> today<00:04:24.080> is

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
people are good at quickscoping today is

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.469 
people are good at quickscoping today is
because<00:04:24.860> they<00:04:25.340> actually<00:04:25.700> spend<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:26.210> lot<00:04:26.450> of

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
because they actually spend a lot of

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.190 
because they actually spend a lot of
time<00:04:26.630> on<00:04:26.870> cod

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
time on cod

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.900 
time on cod
and<00:04:27.290> they're<00:04:27.470> there<00:04:27.890> away<00:04:28.220> from<00:04:28.250> using<00:04:28.640> ray

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
and they're there away from using ray

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.340 
and they're there away from using ray
guns<00:04:29.120> they're<00:04:29.330> away<00:04:29.600> from<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.900> because<00:04:30.080> it's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
guns they're away from that because it's

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.260 
guns they're away from that because it's
so<00:04:30.560> easy<00:04:30.830> there's<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.520> reason<00:04:31.670> why<00:04:31.880> I'm<00:04:31.970> using<00:04:32.090> a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
so easy there's a reason why I'm using a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.670 
so easy there's a reason why I'm using a

red gun in the game right now and that's

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.700 
red gun in the game right now and that's
because<00:04:33.890> I<00:04:34.190> fucking<00:04:34.970> suck<00:04:35.420> with<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.230> sniper<00:04:36.500> I

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
because I fucking suck with a sniper I

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.980 
because I fucking suck with a sniper I
