It was my father &amp; uncle who helped me discover skateboarding when I was 4. Then my uncle taught me the tricks.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.500
In the beginning it was hard to find boards &amp; helmets. I had a surfing helmet... we did what we could!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:10.000
All my family skates: my little brother, my uncle, my cousin, my father... We ride a lot together, it's motivating!

I spend most of my days at the bowl, and I meet all my friends there. We have fun, we make jokes... we enjoy life!
