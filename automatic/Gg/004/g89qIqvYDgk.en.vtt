00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.300
What we actually do is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.860
we train surgeons to better use their tools. 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.180
What it comes down to is that surgery

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.820
is a matter of life for the patients.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.160
I want to devote myself to this and give my best

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.180
so that my best helps doctors with their work

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.420
and ultimately not only saves the patient,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.540
but also makes better surgical outcomes a reality.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.180
We in the medical field have to understand

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.360
the hurdles our patients go through.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.620
That is why empathy is so important.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.300
It is important to have heart.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.400
I wanted to connect Germany and Japan in my work.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.300
It's a lot of fun I can do that at Brainlab.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.380
We have staff from many countries

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.120
and it's great to experience

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
so many different ways of thinking.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.600
The new warehouse is wide and bright

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.860
and there are pink symbols on the walls.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.000
I think it's a design you won't find in other companies.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.400
I like it a lot.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.380
We assembled the shelves and desks ourselves.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.080
It's really a warehouse that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.220
we made with our own hands.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.680
As a business, medical treatment is big and it is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.300
absolutely fascinating to work with this big thing.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.080
At this company, you can do many things

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.960
that you probably couldn't do at others.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.200
"Challenge" is the heart and spirit that drive us here.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.120
"Together we"â€”by really working together

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.600
not just inside Brainlab but together with the doctors

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.780
and together with other companies

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.060
we can achieve anything.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.880
I think this spirit is absolutely essential.
