area if I keep doing these videos but I

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.960 
area if I keep doing these videos but I
thought<00:03:09.859> this<00:03:09.980> one<00:03:10.159> would<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> fun<00:03:10.639> one<00:03:10.790> to

thought this one would be a fun one to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.430 
thought this one would be a fun one to
do<00:03:11.120> mostly<00:03:11.629> for<00:03:11.930> this

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440
