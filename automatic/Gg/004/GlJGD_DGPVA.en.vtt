valuable<00:00:25.220> experience<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:26.000> lot<00:00:26.419> of<00:00:26.450> drivers

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
valuable experience a lot of drivers

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.609 
valuable experience a lot of drivers
that<00:00:27.349> come<00:00:28.310> on<00:00:28.520> to<00:00:28.840> bison<00:00:29.840> transport<00:00:29.960> are

that come on to bison transport are
thinking<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:31.880> do<00:00:32.090> not<00:00:32.239> bring<00:00:32.540> in

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
thinking that we do not bring in

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.150 
thinking that we do not bring in
entry-level<00:00:32.989> drivers<00:00:33.530> but<00:00:33.680> we<00:00:33.800> do<00:00:33.950> we'll

training to do the job well before this
I<00:00:47.180> was<00:00:47.690> just<00:00:48.140> working<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.560> our<00:00:48.650> time<00:00:48.890> and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
I was just working for our time and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.520 
I was just working for our time and
going<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.880> university<00:00:50.270> for<00:00:50.780> computer<00:00:51.140> science

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
going to university for computer science

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.790 
going to university for computer science
and<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.700> got<00:00:53.390> thinking<00:00:53.690> about<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:54.110> decided

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
and I got thinking about that decided

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.340 
and I got thinking about that decided
don't<00:00:55.760> really<00:00:55.940> want<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.180> be<00:00:56.330> a<00:00:56.360> desk<00:00:57.110> all<00:00:57.320> the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
don't really want to be a desk all the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.800 
don't really want to be a desk all the
time<00:00:57.650> so<00:00:57.980> I<00:00:58.010> figured<00:00:58.160> I'd<00:00:58.490> try<00:00:58.790> driving<00:00:59.420> for<00:00:59.780> a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
time so I figured I'd try driving for a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.130 
time so I figured I'd try driving for a
while<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.350> far<00:01:00.620> I'm<00:01:00.770> really<00:01:00.950> enjoying<00:01:01.370> it

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
while and so far I'm really enjoying it

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.880 
while and so far I'm really enjoying it
all<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:02.800> think<00:01:02.950> right<00:01:03.340> off<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.790> start<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:05.290> get

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
all I think right off the start you get

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.880 
all I think right off the start you get
the<00:01:06.040> experience<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:08.020> another<00:01:08.320> driver<00:01:08.560> with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the experience with another driver with

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.700 
the experience with another driver with
you<00:01:09.510> being<00:01:10.510> in<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.720> environment<00:01:11.020> where<00:01:11.470> you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
you being in that environment where you

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.560 
you being in that environment where you
have<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.100> opportunity<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:13.030> make<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.330> big

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
have the opportunity to make a big

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.980 
have the opportunity to make a big
mistake

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
mistake

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.130 
mistake
but<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> instructor<00:01:15.280> that's<00:01:15.670> with<00:01:15.880> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
but the instructor that's with you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.290 
but the instructor that's with you
points<00:01:17.140> out<00:01:17.320> what's<00:01:17.979> going<00:01:18.310> on<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:19.000> how<00:01:19.240> you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
points out what's going on and how you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.150 
points out what's going on and how you
could<00:01:19.750> make<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.290> better<00:01:20.560> decision<00:01:20.710> with

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
could make a better decision with

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.700 
could make a better decision with
certain<00:01:21.430> situation<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:22.479> was<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:23.020> really

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
certain situation it was just really

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.210 
certain situation it was just really
great<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.610> be<00:01:25.290> able<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.440> go<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.890> get<00:01:27.070> the
