00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello welcome to the class picture 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.590
 earlier we saw that viruses infect 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.550
 cells and this 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.730
 specificity depends on the proteins that 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.839
 are present in the virus capsid that 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.910
 we call them binders and 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.650
 receptors of the host cell that 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.240
 are present on the plasma membrane 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.710
 of the host cell is this 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.190
 recognition that goes 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.080
 determine whether the virus infects or 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.350
 cell is this infection occurs through the 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.300
 penetration of genetic material into the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.690
 cell cytoplasm 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.210
 and how this occurs. 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.240
 good penetration 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.070
 there are three different ways 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.560
 if we consider for example a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.480
 bacteriophage which is a virus that infects 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.260
 bacteria is not here my bacteria 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.950
 good or bacteriological, it recognizes 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.330
 bacterial cell is here the capsid 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:28.120
 of our bacteriophage and recognizing the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:32.210
 This bacteriophage is going to 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.780
 only insert the genetic material in the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.510
 inside the bacterial cell or 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.470
 it will inject only the material 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.810
 gene in the cytoplasm of bacteria and 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.990
 this genetic material will command the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.850
 metabolism of the bacteria to the production 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.670
 of new viruses 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.720
 how else is this material 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.490
 gene can be inserted into a cell 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.729
 by merging the envelope then 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.530
 Look, I'm just gonna draw the virus. 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.720
 enveloped let's remember what is a 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.700
 virus envelop 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.960
 it has besides the capsid involving the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.920
 the envelope which has the same 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.110
 constitution of the plasma membrane 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.440
 cell plasma membrane 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.340
 as the fusion of this 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.380
 envelope 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.730
 I'll draw host cell in 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.130
 white just for you to differentiate 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.130
 cell envelope membrane 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.630
 host what will happen here 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.060
 this host has the recipients 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.080
 receptors for the ligands of this 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 envelope and how the envelope has a 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.720
 membrane-like constitution 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.370
 of the host cell is the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.930
 same constitution 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.390
 more ahead you will understand 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.690
 That's better, why? 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.390
 then these giants will connect to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.200
 receptors of the host cells and there 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.640
 will occur the mold of the membrane of the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.230
 envelope with cell membrane 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:24.610
 host country and because of this 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.720
 envelope will open and then it will 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.300
 release the capsid inside the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.100
 cytoplasm of the host cell 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.200
 already in the cytoplasm this capsid will be 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.989
 and genetic material will be 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.799
 released to control the operation 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:48.489
 of the host cell a virus that has 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.580
 this type of cell penetration is the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:55.560
 hiv virus 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.510
 and to finish the last form of 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.660
 penetration of the virus is through en 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.960
 douce tozzi we all have here 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.100
 cell membrane 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.120
 the host is here the virus that 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.390
 also has an envelope that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.120
 capsid of his genetic material virus 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.630
 Okay, so it will be the same 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.840
 between giants of the virus and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.430
 receptors of the host cell and this 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.550
 host cell will begin to encompass 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.740
 This video is going to draw only the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.710
 Envelope is personal so do not delay 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.300
 but you consider that here 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:45.610
 is within the cap so the virus site 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.710
 the federal cell membrane begins to 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.800
 encompass this virus 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.610
 I'm going to step over here when she 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.330
 encompasses all viruses 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.870
 the video is here all encompassed this 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:07.210
 Inside the membrane will open and 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.730
 the virus will now be focused on the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:15.080
 cell cytoplasm 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.660
 this envelope will undo the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.720
 own proteins that are contained in 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.560
 lysosomes of the host cell will 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.380
 digest this envelope and will digest 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.680
 also the capsid and the genetic material 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.990
 virus will be released into the 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.420
 cell cytoplasm 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.880
 good people, I hope you have 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.390
 from the next class 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:46.630
 We are going to study reproductive cycles. 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.630
 of different viruses do not lose and until then
