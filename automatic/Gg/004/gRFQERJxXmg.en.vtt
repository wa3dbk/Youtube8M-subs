they're burning now I got to put a roof

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.900 
they're burning now I got to put a roof
over<00:03:59.340> their<00:03:59.549> heads<00:04:01.220> yeah<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.250> don't<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.730> don't

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
over their heads yeah I don't I don't

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.250 
over their heads yeah I don't I don't
know<00:04:03.090> one<00:04:03.239> thing<00:04:03.269> about<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.989> guys

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
know one thing about this is you guys

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.080 
know one thing about this is you guys
can<00:04:04.500> try<00:04:04.650> this<00:04:04.709> for<00:04:04.980> yourself<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.579> well<00:04:05.609> hey

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
can try this for yourself as well hey

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.420 
can try this for yourself as well hey
joe<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.109> for<00:04:07.410> yourself<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.829> maybe<00:04:08.129> we'll

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
joe this for yourself so maybe we'll

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.920 
joe this for yourself so maybe we'll
just<00:04:08.609> put<00:04:08.819> plausible<00:04:09.420> for<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.629> one<00:04:09.810> will

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
just put plausible for this one will

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.210 
just put plausible for this one will
hold<00:04:10.140> up<00:04:10.230> let<00:04:10.410> me<00:04:10.440> actually<00:04:10.709> push<00:04:11.069> these

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
hold up let me actually push these

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.240 
hold up let me actually push these
pistons<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.849> little<00:04:12.390> bit<00:04:12.480> more<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.959> almost<00:04:13.950> have

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
pistons a little bit more I almost have

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.210 
pistons a little bit more I almost have
them<00:04:14.430> all<00:04:14.519> into<00:04:14.640> one<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:15.030> want<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.450> include

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
them all into one you want to include

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.430 
them all into one you want to include
super<00:04:17.220> fan<00:04:18.949> we<00:04:19.949> go<00:04:20.660> get<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.780> angle<00:04:21.870> properly

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
super fan we go get the angle properly

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.210 
super fan we go get the angle properly
yeah<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.960> piston<00:04:25.960> placement<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.500> not<00:04:26.680> important

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
yeah I piston placement is not important

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.820 
yeah I piston placement is not important
okay<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.360> don't<00:04:29.230> really<00:04:29.440> know<00:04:29.620> what's<00:04:29.770> going

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
okay I I don't really know what's going

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.950 
okay I I don't really know what's going
on<00:04:30.130> over<00:04:30.280> there<00:04:30.520> bro<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:31.030> hear<00:04:31.330> them<00:04:31.480> die<00:04:31.630> oh

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
on over there bro I hear them die oh

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.910 
on over there bro I hear them die oh
don't<00:04:32.500> die<00:04:32.850> don't<00:04:33.850> die<00:04:34.060> oh<00:04:34.540> oh<00:04:34.930> no<00:04:35.440> okay

don't die don't die oh oh no okay
they're<00:04:36.130> done<00:04:36.280> I'll<00:04:36.700> see<00:04:36.880> how<00:04:36.970> many<00:04:37.120> i<00:04:37.240> have

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
they're done I'll see how many i have

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.690 
they're done I'll see how many i have
here<00:04:37.870> if<00:04:38.020> none<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.710> them<00:04:38.890> went<00:04:39.040> through<00:04:39.370> and

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
here if none of them went through and

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.300 
here if none of them went through and
this<00:04:39.850> is<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.060> failed<00:04:40.360> experiment<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.220> don't<00:04:42.220> know

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
this is a failed experiment I don't know

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.130 
this is a failed experiment I don't know
like<00:04:42.700> he<00:04:42.820> was<00:04:42.940> kind<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.180> skeptical<00:04:43.510> because<00:04:43.810> it

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
like he was kind of skeptical because it

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.260 
like he was kind of skeptical because it
seemed<00:04:44.350> like<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> tomb<00:04:45.040> under<00:04:45.340> my<00:04:45.430> left<00:04:45.610> out<00:04:46.150> my

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
seemed like a tomb under my left out my

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.140 
seemed like a tomb under my left out my
pigment<00:04:46.660> I<00:04:47.250> don't<00:04:48.250> know<00:04:48.340> maybe<00:04:48.520> they<00:04:49.000> were

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
pigment I don't know maybe they were

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.200 
pigment I don't know maybe they were
just<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.810> know<00:04:49.840> what<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.200> point<00:04:50.350> 2<00:04:50.620> 3<00:04:51.160> 4<00:04:51.460> 5<00:04:51.700> 6<00:04:51.730> 7

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
just you know what the point 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.150 
just you know what the point 2 3 4 5 6 7
8<00:04:52.510> 9<00:04:52.540> 10<00:04:52.750> i<00:04:53.020> have<00:04:53.140> all<00:04:53.320> 10<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.530> my<00:04:53.680> pavement<00:04:54.010> none

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
8 9 10 i have all 10 of my pavement none

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.250 
8 9 10 i have all 10 of my pavement none
of<00:04:54.280> them<00:04:54.460> are<00:04:54.640> waiting<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.660> is<00:04:55.840> actually

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
of them are waiting this is actually

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.870 
of them are waiting this is actually
busted<00:04:56.740> but<00:04:56.920> then<00:04:57.040> again<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.430> might<00:04:57.670> be

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
busted but then again it might be

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.820 
busted but then again it might be
plausible<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.660> hadley<00:04:59.140> suggest<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.680> guys

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
plausible and hadley suggest you guys

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.350 
plausible and hadley suggest you guys
actually<00:05:00.100> definitely<00:05:00.760> drive<00:05:00.970> yourself

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
actually definitely drive yourself

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.760 
actually definitely drive yourself
because<00:05:01.630> this<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:01.930> literally<00:05:02.230> happens<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.650> be

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
because this is literally happens to be

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.410 
because this is literally happens to be
possible<00:05:03.100> i<00:05:03.160> don't<00:05:03.340> know<00:05:03.400> but<00:05:03.820> i<00:05:03.910> think<00:05:04.300> that

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
possible i don't know but i think that

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.110 
possible i don't know but i think that
should<00:05:04.780> wrap<00:05:05.200> this<00:05:05.230> episode<00:05:06.160> up<00:05:06.460> don't<00:05:07.060> you

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
should wrap this episode up don't you

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.840 
should wrap this episode up don't you
that<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.900> should<00:05:08.140> really<00:05:08.620> show<00:05:08.920> it<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.190> i<00:05:09.460> will

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
that it should really show it so i will
