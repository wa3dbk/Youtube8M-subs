00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.630
 a lot of green of Bernardino boys 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.150
 born weiner tutorial here is mixed 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.960
 black and speaks to you is today I'll show you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.029
 how to log in forever forever 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 ever to our room of peace and peace 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.330
 then you will first have to build yourself 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.099
 the infinite turbine use the lecce 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.759
 of your life I can here below 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.090
 the gentleman did it yesterday and it is 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.079
 great mister and a salutami star ed 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.430
 forever 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.930
 apart from the hunting apart from the bullshit 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 let's get back to us so you'll have to do 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.120
 this lyricals that infinite 10 datable 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 then built your turbine vi 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 take turbine and go to the room on 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.600
 generator get the generator room 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 we choose below and position the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.609
 our infinite turbine then I did 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 this we throw a grenade in front of the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.640
 our turbine so the head will leave 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.010
 of the mannequin 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 in front of this part as you see the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 turbine is actually infinite ie 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 of zombies will attack the hand turbine 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 don't worry because this 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 actually and can not be 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 destroyed unless we take a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 new turbine at the first stop and one 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.430
 once a note is taken, the turbine blows 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.530
 so the previous one will disappear so much 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.210
 be careful because if you fix the here 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 turbine be after throwing the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 grenade you want to move it you can't 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.360
 move it but you have to take a new one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.549
 and repeat the whole procedure 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.670
 so let's take the manga we pull the usual ones 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.430
 two grenades to open the security doors 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 and how can we see this fucking 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.460
 door is open 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.320
 so we lived it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 quietly we leave all of that of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 don't do we assemble our pa 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.890
 belly that we speed up a lot 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.280
 you know the pieces are always below not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.409
 you can go wrong 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.940
 so we can safely play 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.770
 without worrying about having to do more 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.680
 worry about becoming take 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.090
 turbines at the first stop 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.390
 however from that generator the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.539
 marat stops there the only thing there 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.190
 remember as I said before if you go to 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.250
 not take a new turbine 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.590
 don't think about it it will obviously disappear 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.690
 the turbine message therefore you must 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.850
 take it all over again 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.010
 other thing if you're wondering if 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.810
 you can take other items and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.280
 basically you can take everything 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.090
 the one who talks to you that is not important 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.060
 take other another tobino you will know 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.890
 take shield all traps you and it seems 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.140
 but not the turbine 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.300
 having said that I take this opportunity to give you 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.330
 give you a nice greeting and best wishes for 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.330
