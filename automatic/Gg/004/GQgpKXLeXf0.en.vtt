00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
then they'll start double teaming and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.090 
then they'll start double teaming and
I'll<00:03:45.330> get<00:03:45.450> some<00:03:45.600> assist<00:03:45.930> which<00:03:46.500> Kobe<00:03:46.770> did<00:03:46.920> get

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.490 
some assists but you really have to have
pretty<00:03:50.520> much<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.910> seems<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.300> me<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.690> straight-up

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
