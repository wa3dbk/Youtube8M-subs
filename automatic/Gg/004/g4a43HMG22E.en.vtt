00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.320
 thrust on straight legs with delivery egor 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.869
 performs are not mapped to 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.390
 much more stress make block le 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 tour du doing this is not the first exercise 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.940
 that is, already on the drive 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.980
 do a lot of reps 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.100
 to penetrate deeper muscles that is 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.699
 the first exercise is a basic 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.979
 done on from 3 to 6 maybe 8 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.250
 reps in this case we have paying 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:50.409
 like a jerk too with a stand on 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.109
 3 for 3 and then already went thrust on 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.590
 straight legs give the main muscle line 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.050
 hips 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.899
 which is maximally stretched and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.730
 we get stress for the back in such 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.980
 unusual big kits to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.300
 target on 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.649
 load your back all the most 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.649
 provoke mass gain 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.719
 scars wide fee exercise 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.539
 borrowed from practice watch athletics but 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:24.119
 performed without lifting without jerking 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.630
 the goal is precisely the wide setting wide 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.270
 grip 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 what it is to replace the complex 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.799
 trapezoid again we work in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.789
 unusual power lexin 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.460
 be the very foundation for the future 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.229
 target muscle growth even though we will 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 I will continue to use the church 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.659
 trapeze on you to be more conflict in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.720
 this exercise we are preparing in this way 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.500
 let's go deep brother pasha know muscles 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.500
 sleep very much 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.920
 bending the legs lying on the machine my favorite 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.260
 thigh biceps exercise and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.340
 following exercises 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.950
 safe exercise here almost 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.440
 it is impossible to tear muscles 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.900
 very good at all will fall 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.590
 feel the work of the biceps femoris 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.480
 exercises for uploading general developmental I 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.110
 exhibiting in the whole workout you were angry 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.110
 deadlifts all most subject 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.940
 load on the back of the thigh and 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.910
 I recommend doing this exercise from 8 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.120
 up to 20 repetitions depending here is the loop 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.610
 the program in this case is proud 10 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.060
 reps hundreds weighing me a covenant to 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.650
 do finish off and have them rolled up that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.650
 called working last 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:50.760
 steam goes upright for spirits without water 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:58.620
 have you gone 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:01.620
 feeling to arrange your future traits
