so<00:03:28.650> already<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.040> 75,000<00:03:29.970> already<00:03:30.690> 1/4<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
so already at 75,000 already 1/4 of the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.990 
so already at 75,000 already 1/4 of the
way<00:03:31.440> there<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.890> think<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.370> my<00:03:32.520> math<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.880> correct

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
way there I think if my math is correct

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.130 
way there I think if my math is correct
and<00:03:33.600> we<00:03:34.440> got<00:03:34.620> our<00:03:34.800> game<00:03:35.250> breaker<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.930> is

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
and we got our game breaker so this is

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.860 
and we got our game breaker so this is
easily<00:03:37.590> going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.920> give<00:03:38.040> us<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.220> ton<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> points

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
easily going to give us a ton of points

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.530 
easily going to give us a ton of points
because<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.560> game<00:03:40.740> breaker<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.540> I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
because it is the game breaker and I

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.860 
because it is the game breaker and I
missed<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:43.680> I'm<00:03:44.160> an<00:03:44.310> idiot

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
missed it because I'm an idiot
