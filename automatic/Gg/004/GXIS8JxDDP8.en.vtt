the 80s
he'd<00:04:07.209> probably<00:04:07.420> walk<00:04:07.750> past<00:04:08.049> every<00:04:08.350> single

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
he'd probably walk past every single

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.630 
he'd probably walk past every single
player<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.070> exists<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:12.130> be<00:04:12.280> honest<00:04:12.519> if

level<00:04:14.709> compared<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.280> Messi's<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.820> think<00:04:16.120> Messi

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
level compared to Messi's I think Messi

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.870 
level compared to Messi's I think Messi
has<00:04:16.539> gone<00:04:16.660> higher<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.100> think<00:04:18.220> it's<00:04:18.579> safe<00:04:18.700> to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
has gone higher so I think it's safe to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.449 
has gone higher so I think it's safe to
say<00:04:18.910> Messi<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.600> probably<00:04:20.079> done<00:04:20.459> all-time

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459
