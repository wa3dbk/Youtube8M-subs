what you might notice is that we've
already<00:00:40.200> removed<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.950> there's<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.820> sort

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
already removed them there's like sort

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.760 
already removed them there's like sort
of<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.600> where<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:42.870> fingers<00:00:43.260> sort<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> sitting

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of just where my fingers sort of sitting

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.950 
of just where my fingers sort of sitting
here<00:00:44.100> where<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.940> intake<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.539> intake

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
here where that intake and that intake

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.160 
here where that intake and that intake
is<00:00:46.190> it's<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> cover<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> BMW<00:00:49.020> logo

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is it's like a cover with the BMW logo

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
is it's like a cover with the BMW logo
on<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:49.710> leads<00:00:49.950> into<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> airbox<00:00:50.640> there

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
on it which leads into the airbox there

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
on it which leads into the airbox there
well<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:52.110> already<00:00:52.410> been<00:00:52.590> removed<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.190> was

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
well that's already been removed it was

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.920 
well that's already been removed it was
just<00:00:53.579> three<00:00:53.850> screws<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.629> screw

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
just three screws there's one screw

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860 
just three screws there's one screw
there<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:56.039> screw<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.539> screw

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
there one screw there and one screw

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.639 
there one screw there and one screw
there<00:00:58.109> very<00:00:58.770> easy<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.640> slides<00:00:59.879> out

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
there very easy and it just slides out

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.660 
there very easy and it just slides out
so<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.829> we're<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so what we're going to do now is just

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
so what we're going to do now is just
show<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.329> process<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> remove<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.890> inlet

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
show you the process to remove the inlet

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.640 
show you the process to remove the inlet
or<00:01:05.880> intake<00:01:06.270> camshaft<00:01:06.960> sensor<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
or intake camshaft sensor for this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
or intake camshaft sensor for this
vehicle<00:01:07.939> alright<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> do

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
vehicle alright so what I'm going to do

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.109 
vehicle alright so what I'm going to do
now<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:11.340> zoom<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> actual<00:01:13.110> intake

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
now is just zoom in on the actual intake

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:26.250 
now is just zoom in on the actual intake
camshaft<00:01:15.119> sensor

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.570 

so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.800 

what<00:01:31.580> we<00:01:31.700> have<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.909> connector<00:01:35.510> which

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
what we have this is the connector which

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.910 
what we have this is the connector which
you<00:01:35.930> don't<00:01:36.110> really<00:01:36.200> need<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.500> worry<00:01:36.799> about

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you don't really need to worry about

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.840 
you don't really need to worry about
just<00:01:37.220> yet<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.380> board<00:01:42.820> which<00:01:43.820> you

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
just yet this is the board which you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.499 
just yet this is the board which you
need<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.270> get<00:01:44.450> out<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.890> five<00:01:46.190> mil<00:01:46.490> allen<00:01:46.909> bolt

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
need to get out the five mil allen bolt

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.560 
need to get out the five mil allen bolt
and<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:48.409> year<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.399> actual<00:01:49.880> camshaft

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
and this year is the actual camshaft

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.910 
and this year is the actual camshaft
sensor<00:01:52.090> now<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.149> obvious<00:01:53.540> thing<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.170> me<00:01:54.530> would

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
sensor now the obvious thing to me would

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.440 
sensor now the obvious thing to me would
be<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.280> actually<00:01:56.740> disconnect<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.450> electrical

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
be to actually disconnect the electrical

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.560 
be to actually disconnect the electrical
clip<00:01:59.750> here<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:01.369> would<00:02:01.520> seem<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.300> most

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
clip here that would seem like the most

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.260 
clip here that would seem like the most
logical<00:02:02.720> thing<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.410> but<00:02:03.940> believe<00:02:04.940> me<00:02:04.970> it's

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
logical thing to do but believe me it's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.770 
logical thing to do but believe me it's
not<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:06.770> more<00:02:06.950> difficult<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.490> do<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
not it's more difficult to do that the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.479 
not it's more difficult to do that the
easiest<00:02:09.050> thing<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.320> do<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.709> just<00:02:09.860> remove<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.280> by

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
easiest thing to do is just remove it by

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.840 
easiest thing to do is just remove it by
the<00:02:11.260> board<00:02:12.260> here<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:12.800> what<00:02:13.459> I'm<00:02:13.550> going<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.730> do

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the board here so what I'm going to do

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:25.610 
the board here so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.120> put<00:02:14.360> my<00:02:14.480> iron<00:02:14.690> key<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.500> then

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.600 

try<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.740> move<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.190> see<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.690> takes<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.840> bit<00:02:28.960> of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
try and move it to see it takes a bit of

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.800 
try and move it to see it takes a bit of
strength<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.820> move<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.090> at<00:02:31.180> first<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:31.660> once

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
strength to move it at first but once

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.250 
strength to move it at first but once
you've<00:02:32.050> moved<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:34.390> will<00:02:34.660> come<00:02:34.840> out<00:02:34.930> quite

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
you've moved it it will come out quite

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.150 
you've moved it it will come out quite
freely

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.180 

it's<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.400> case<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.640> finding<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:41.190> route

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
it's just a case of finding it a route

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.710 
it's just a case of finding it a route
where<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:43.680> spin<00:02:44.680> around<00:02:44.710> freely<00:02:45.520> as<00:02:46.450> I'm

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
where you can spin around freely as I'm

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.930 
where you can spin around freely as I'm
doing<00:02:46.930> here<00:02:47.290> once<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.070> get<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.460> far<00:02:48.730> out

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
doing here once you get it so far out

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.300 
doing here once you get it so far out
you<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.020> just<00:02:50.200> do<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.320> by<00:02:50.410> hand<00:02:52.830> my<00:02:53.830> good<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:54.280> it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
you can just do it by hand my good do it

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.250 
you can just do it by hand my good do it
by<00:02:54.520> hand<00:02:54.730> now<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.890> can<00:03:01.260> make

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
by hand now see you have to can make

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.570 
by hand now see you have to can make
sure<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.710> drop<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> ball<00:03:03.160> when<00:03:03.430> it's

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
sure you and drop the ball when it's

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.610 
sure you and drop the ball when it's
ready<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:04.470> come<00:03:05.470> out

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.970 

so<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.550> ball<00:03:08.700> they're<00:03:09.739> put<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.769> to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
so that's the ball they're put out to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.630 
so that's the ball they're put out to
one<00:03:11.129> side

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
one side

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.680 
one side
now<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.379> need<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:13.980> give<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
now all you need to do is give the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.430 
now all you need to do is give the
camshaft<00:03:15.690> sensor<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.080> pole<00:03:20.930> still<00:03:21.930> connected

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
camshaft sensor a pole still connected

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.190 
camshaft sensor a pole still connected
remember<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:26.099> might<00:03:26.310> find<00:03:26.549> some<00:03:26.730> oil<00:03:26.879> on<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
remember you might find some oil on the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.199 
remember you might find some oil on the
camshaft<00:03:28.200> sensor<00:03:28.560> when<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:28.950> comes<00:03:29.129> out<00:03:35.209> and

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
camshaft sensor when it comes out and

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.920 
camshaft sensor when it comes out and
there<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:40.849> that<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.030> camshaft<00:03:42.720> sensor

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
there it is that is the camshaft sensor

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.449 
there it is that is the camshaft sensor
removal<00:03:43.549> just<00:03:44.549> really<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.910> case<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:49.459> unplugging

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
removal just really a case of unplugging

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.840 
removal just really a case of unplugging
it<00:03:50.640> from<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:52.019> connectors

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.110 

squealing<00:03:57.850> hard<00:03:58.150> on<00:03:58.360> both<00:03:58.570> sides<00:03:59.100> to<00:04:00.120> release

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
squealing hard on both sides to release

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.500 
squealing hard on both sides to release
the<00:04:01.300> sensor<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:03.580> then<00:04:03.700> putting<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.120> back<00:04:04.150> in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the sensor and then putting it back in

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.830 
the sensor and then putting it back in
it's<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.050> exact<00:04:05.350> reverse<00:04:06.840> slightly

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
it's just the exact reverse slightly

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.780 
it's just the exact reverse slightly
kick<00:04:08.020> new<00:04:08.200> camshaft<00:04:08.470> sensor<00:04:08.860> back<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.400> there

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
kick new camshaft sensor back in there

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:19.400 
kick new camshaft sensor back in there
till<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.900> clicks<00:04:12.510> slop<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.630> back<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:14.110> full

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.930 

and<00:04:19.500> then<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.340> your<00:04:20.430> board<00:04:22.520> some<00:04:23.520> people<00:04:23.760> do

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
and then get your board some people do

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.240 
and then get your board some people do
see<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.510> best<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.960> actually<00:04:25.250> replace

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
see that it's best to actually replace

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.690 
see that it's best to actually replace
the<00:04:26.550> board<00:04:30.830> but<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:31.950> not<00:04:32.160> it's<00:04:32.550> not

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
the board but it's not it's not

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:42.010 
the board but it's not it's not
necessary<00:04:33.290> if<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.440> ask<00:04:34.620> me

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.430 

this<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.680> casein

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
this is the casein

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.200 
this is the casein
popping<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.220> ball<00:04:45.340> back<00:04:45.640> in

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.020 

I'll<00:04:53.720> show<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:53.990> how<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.320> do<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.790> I<00:04:55.820> leave

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
I'll show you how to do that so I leave

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.360 
I'll show you how to do that so I leave
that<00:04:56.120> information<00:04:56.300> with<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.170> is<00:04:58.130> the
