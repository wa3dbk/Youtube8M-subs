 handsome tail okay that you can 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.980
 expect from a concept car to give

 inside thick carpet everywhere soft 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.000

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.930
 huge panorama disc with the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.989
 connecting plastic disc almost 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.880
 the whole roof fills extremely variable 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.469
 the first back seat row at the touch of a button 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.050
 the middle seat folds to the armrest 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.870
 and the outer seats move backwards 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.710
 that's almost maybach like that 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.930
 sahnehÃ¤ubchen 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.370
 the electrically rotatable headrest the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.630
 so in a gentle pillow 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.060
 transform 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.340
 the motto away from the worker to the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.170
 avant-garde for the sake of the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.780
 Zafira probably also the place king 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.220
 opel stays with just under four meters 70 becomes 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.630
 he lasted longer than his predecessor and divorced 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.820
 with it a bit upwards in the direction 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 vw sharan or ford galaxy 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.290
 of course this is a study, of course 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.570
 but much of what we see here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 Of course it will also be the way in the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.930
 series zafira find autumn on the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.210
 market comes the body for example 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.619
 which is very very similar and it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.090
 There are some things we want too 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.650
 like to see it in series zafira then 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 for example, the fantastic panorama roof 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.680
 or the interesting seating concept in the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.800
 second row 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.840
 I'm curious what's left over 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.000
 prices and engines may still violent 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.860
 be speculated start stop system and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.790
 Direct injection turbo gasoline are 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.100
 here are the keywords 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.680
 Fact is visually the new zafira 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 the high utility value remains really tasty 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.860
 of the predecessor 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.550
 then it will almost certainly be one again 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.550
 success story
