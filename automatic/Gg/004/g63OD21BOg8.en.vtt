it's made me understand Riggs all the
way<00:03:04.440> through<00:03:04.830> their<00:03:05.040> development<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.240> now<00:03:06.450> I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
way through their development so now I

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.260 
way through their development so now I
understand<00:03:07.340> when<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.730> make<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.940> change

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
understand when I have to make a change

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.190 
understand when I have to make a change
when<00:03:09.990> they're<00:03:10.170> not<00:03:10.350> working<00:03:10.700> what<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.730> call<00:03:12.200> rig

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
when they're not working what I call rig

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.340 
when they're not working what I call rig
mechanics<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.940> understand<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.870> basic

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
mechanics you understand the basic

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.010 
mechanics you understand the basic
fundamentals<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:17.460> what<00:03:18.150> you're<00:03:18.390> looking<00:03:18.420> for

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
fundamentals of what you're looking for

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.800 
fundamentals of what you're looking for
in<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.290> rig<00:03:19.500> then<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.520> understand<00:03:21.210> when<00:03:21.690> he's

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
in a rig then you understand when he's

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.160 
in a rig then you understand when he's
not<00:03:21.960> working<00:03:22.230> for<00:03:22.710> you<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:24.240> know<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.510> kids

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
not working for you you know the kids

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
not working for you you know the kids
nowadays<00:03:25.590> are<00:03:25.950> coming<00:03:26.670> into<00:03:26.820> Cartesian<00:03:27.570> a

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
nowadays are coming into Cartesian a

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.570 
nowadays are coming into Cartesian a
cool<00:03:28.230> 7<00:03:28.709> got<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.670> knowledge<00:03:30.500> I've<00:03:31.500> got<00:03:31.740> sad

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
cool 7 got that knowledge I've got sad

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
cool 7 got that knowledge I've got sad
thing<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:32.880> know<00:03:33.000> not<00:03:33.660> old<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:33.990> me<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.530> being

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
thing you know not old like me and being

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.740 
thing you know not old like me and being
around<00:03:34.830> all<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.340> years<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.270> they<00:03:36.360> kind<00:03:36.630> of

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
around all these years so they kind of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.710 
around all these years so they kind of
latch<00:03:36.959> onto<00:03:37.260> latest<00:03:37.890> reading<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.310> magazine

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
latch onto latest reading a magazine

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.560 
latch onto latest reading a magazine
hoping<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> given<00:03:40.500> access<00:03:41.160> they<00:03:41.400> need<00:03:41.570> but

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
hoping that a given access they need but

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.710 
hoping that a given access they need but
yeah<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:44.820> got<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.209> depth<00:03:45.510> of

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
yeah because then got that depth of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.890 
yeah because then got that depth of
understanding<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.920> kind<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.090> think<00:03:48.150> waste

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
understanding it's kind of I think waste

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.080 
understanding it's kind of I think waste
of<00:03:49.110> time<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.770> know<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.310> that's<00:03:50.490> why<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:50.700> want

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
of time you know and that's why I want

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.620 
of time you know and that's why I want
to<00:03:51.180> try<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.510> cut<00:03:51.660> across<00:03:51.930> in<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:52.320> DVD
