00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
yeah someone probably principal

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.570

differences<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:21.020> monetary<00:00:22.220> sensor<00:00:23.220> for

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
differences to me monetary sensor for

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700 
differences to me monetary sensor for
once<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.359> sensor<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.900> been<00:00:25.080> completed<00:00:25.439> with

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
once or sensor has been completed with

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490 
once or sensor has been completed with
redesigned<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.150> noise<00:00:27.869> before<00:00:28.050> birth<00:00:28.380> is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
redesigned so the noise before birth is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.439 
redesigned so the noise before birth is
you<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:29.099> stops<00:00:29.340> ahead<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> 5d

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you know two stops ahead of what the 5d

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.930 
you know two stops ahead of what the 5d
mark<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.380> okay<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.820> were

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
mark two can do okay so if you were

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.540 
mark two can do okay so if you were
happy<00:00:33.239> will<00:00:33.450> say<00:00:33.600> 800<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> value<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.710> r2<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
happy will say 800 on the value of r2 it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.229 
happy will say 800 on the value of r2 it
gets<00:00:35.700> shoot<00:00:35.880> comfortably<00:00:36.329> at<00:00:36.420> 3200<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.380> one

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
gets shoot comfortably at 3200 this one

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.720 
gets shoot comfortably at 3200 this one
to<00:00:39.239> stop<00:00:39.480> Sahara<00:00:39.780> yeah<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.379> also<00:00:40.579> on<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
to stop Sahara yeah and also on the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360 
to stop Sahara yeah and also on the
lower<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.450> ratings<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.440> dynamic<00:00:44.219> range

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
lower is all ratings the dynamic range

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
lower is all ratings the dynamic range
new<00:00:44.730> improved<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.210> well<00:00:45.239> yeah<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.649> both

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
new improved as well yeah so for both

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
new improved as well yeah so for both
low<00:00:47.129> light<00:00:47.340> shoes<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.820> landscape<00:00:48.210> shooters

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
low light shoes and landscape shooters

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
low light shoes and landscape shooters
this<00:00:49.079> will<00:00:49.320> give<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.770> better<00:00:50.100> image<00:00:50.399> quality

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this will give you better image quality

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.260 
this will give you better image quality
definitely<00:00:51.620> because<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.210> processor<00:00:54.210> has

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
definitely because the processor has

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
definitely because the processor has
been<00:00:54.480> improved<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.699> terms<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
been improved as well so in terms of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
been improved as well so in terms of
actual<00:00:57.329> real<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.199> processing<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> camera

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
actual real time processing the camera

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.680 
actual real time processing the camera
is<00:00:59.280> constantly<00:00:59.730> taking<00:00:59.910> away<00:01:00.239> free<00:01:00.480> time

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
is constantly taking away free time

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
is constantly taking away free time
fringing<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.980> chromatic<00:01:02.760> aberration<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
fringing and chromatic aberration and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.460 
fringing and chromatic aberration and
also<00:01:04.019> vignetting<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> losing<00:01:05.610> time

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
also vignetting for you losing time

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
also vignetting for you losing time
because<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.880> process<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.299> quick<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.810> as

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
because the process is so quick now as

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
because the process is so quick now as
well<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.220> allowed<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.970> shoot<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
well get now and have allowed to shoot a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.340 
well get now and have allowed to shoot a
bit<00:01:12.869> rate<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.320> video<00:01:13.820> alright<00:01:14.820> yes<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
bit rate for video alright yes so a you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.170 
bit rate for video alright yes so a you
still<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> only<00:01:16.950> bitrate<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.880> 25

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
still have the only bitrate like like 25

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
still have the only bitrate like like 25
email<00:01:18.479> too<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> new<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.439> rate<00:01:19.650> doubles

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
email too but the new bit rate doubles

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.510 
email too but the new bit rate doubles
the<00:01:20.340> amount<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.390> data<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:23.250> only

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the amount of data and it's not only

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149 
the amount of data and it's not only
saved<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.540> say<00:01:24.750> defy<00:01:25.200> him<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> one

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
saved up so say defy him up to go to one

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
saved up so say defy him up to go to one
frame<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.640> next<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> next<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
frame to the next to the next like this

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
frame to the next to the next like this
and<00:01:28.080> from<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.130> frame<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> other<00:01:29.700> 5d<00:01:30.119> Mark<00:01:30.299> II

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and from one frame to other 5d Mark II

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.510 
and from one frame to other 5d Mark II
obviously<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> changes<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
obviously the changes from one to the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.800 
obviously the changes from one to the
next<00:01:32.610> okay<00:01:33.560> yeah<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> 25<00:01:35.790> III<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.360> safe<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
next okay yeah on the 25 III is safe the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.710 
next okay yeah on the 25 III is safe the
past<00:01:37.049> frames<00:01:37.430> all<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> enterprise

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
past frames all right all I enterprise

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
past frames all right all I enterprise
through<00:01:40.049> hampel<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> sort<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> capture

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
through hampel you can sort of capture

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
through hampel you can sort of capture
exactly<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> pull<00:01:43.110> pull<00:01:43.439> frames<00:01:43.710> are

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
exactly you can pull pull frames are

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.429 
exactly you can pull pull frames are
easier<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> edit<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.079> lot<00:01:46.229> easier

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
easier you can you can edit a lot easier

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
easier you can you can edit a lot easier
right<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.610> also<00:01:47.759> better<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.180> detail

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
right so and also better for detail

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.600 
right so and also better for detail
which<00:01:48.810> edges<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.380> roll

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.250 

exactly<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:52.940> all<00:01:53.120> of<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.390> advantage<00:01:54.140> in

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
exactly so all of the advantage in

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.930 
exactly so all of the advantage in
dynamic<00:01:54.620> range<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:54.920> noise<00:01:55.070> also<00:01:55.460> translated

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
dynamic range of noise also translated

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.870 
dynamic range of noise also translated
video<00:01:56.180> ok<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.320> does<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.920> no<00:01:58.010> good<00:01:58.040> combination

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
video ok so does you no good combination

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.520 
video ok so does you no good combination
increase<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.510> terms<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.840> stills<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.320> videos

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
increase in terms of stills and videos

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.440 
increase in terms of stills and videos
because<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.950> sets<00:02:01.100> up<00:02:01.280> processes<00:02:01.760> length<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
because it sets up processes length of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.350 
because it sets up processes length of
time<00:02:02.630> initiative<00:02:03.440> now<00:02:04.280> 29<00:02:04.790> minutes<00:02:05.060> 59

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
time initiative now 29 minutes 59

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.670 
time initiative now 29 minutes 59
seconds<00:02:05.690> or<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:05.930> going<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.140> be<00:02:06.260> round<00:02:06.500> there

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
seconds or it's going to be round there

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:22.560 
seconds or it's going to be round there
yes<00:02:09.680> exactly

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.020 

yes<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.620> good<00:02:25.010> thing<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.790> time

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
yes and so the good thing is the time

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.000 
yes and so the good thing is the time
limit<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.630> now<00:02:26.810> been<00:02:27.050> increasing<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.680> almost

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

call the hdmi asset yeah you can't but
that<00:03:05.630> would<00:03:06.400> because<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:07.760> don't<00:03:08.000> wait<00:03:08.210> up

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380

that's right yes the thing is clear idea
of<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> reason<00:03:20.120> why<00:03:20.240> we<00:03:20.480> hired<00:03:20.750> on<00:03:20.990> us<00:03:21.260> because

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
I remembered the output from the hdmi

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.200 
I remembered the output from the hdmi
has<00:03:24.680> already<00:03:24.950> gone<00:03:25.310> through<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.850> color

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
has already gone through the color

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.500 
has already gone through the color
sampling<00:03:26.720> stop<00:03:27.560> crashing<00:03:27.920> so<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:29.030> will<00:03:29.210> be<00:03:29.240> for

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
sampling stop crashing so it will be for

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.830 
sampling stop crashing so it will be for
20<00:03:30.520> it's<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.580> lot<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.060> even<00:03:32.660> though<00:03:32.780> you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
20 it's a lot of it so even though you

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.960

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
big megabits a second if you want to

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.300 
big megabits a second if you want to
it's<00:03:37.160> still<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.580> 420<00:03:38.330> someplace<00:03:41.470> else<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:43.100> was

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.030 

okay<00:03:59.359> I'll<00:04:00.079> be<00:04:00.170> impressive<00:04:00.560> though<00:04:00.680> they<00:04:00.890> can

on<00:04:04.670> yo<00:04:04.849> just<00:04:05.090> keeps<00:04:05.599> coming<00:04:05.930> at<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.049> union

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.390 

22<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.930> that's<00:04:19.139> how<00:04:19.319> we<00:04:19.349> can<00:04:19.650> keep<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.949> law<00:04:20.099> so

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
22 so that's how we can keep the law so

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:31.340 
22 so that's how we can keep the law so
