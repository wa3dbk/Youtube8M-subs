was just talking to you about this on
how<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> I've<00:00:16.770> got<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> UM<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.410> contours<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.410> my

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
how I I've got the UM the contours of my

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
how I I've got the UM the contours of my
head<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.490> decided<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.340> know<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> was

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
head I decided it was a you know it was

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.040 
head I decided it was a you know it was
a<00:00:23.760> real<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.029> idea<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.510> idea<00:00:24.539> cuz<00:00:24.930> obviously

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
a real good idea my idea cuz obviously

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
a real good idea my idea cuz obviously
if<00:00:25.470> things<00:00:25.650> were<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:25.859> manageable<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.550> wasn't

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
if things were more manageable I wasn't

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.980 
if things were more manageable I wasn't
having<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.480> use<00:00:27.930> huge<00:00:28.439> pieces<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.630> foam<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
having to use huge pieces of foam and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.440 
having to use huge pieces of foam and
position<00:00:31.710> them<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> basically

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
position them so I basically

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
position them so I basically
incorporated<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> back<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
incorporated what I use in the back to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.950 
incorporated what I use in the back to
the<00:00:35.309> front<00:00:35.579> I've<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.630> cut<00:00:36.870> them

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the front I've actually just cut them

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.950 
the front I've actually just cut them
into<00:00:37.140> thin<00:00:37.410> strips<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.540> lay<00:00:39.719> them

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
into thin strips and then just lay them

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.569 
into thin strips and then just lay them
over<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.469> contours<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:42.030> face<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.710> cut

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
over the contours of my face just cut

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
over the contours of my face just cut
out<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> ipa's<00:00:45.360> obviously<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
out the ipa's obviously this is this is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.889 
out the ipa's obviously this is this is
obviously<00:00:46.649> still<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.850> under<00:00:48.000> part<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
obviously still be under part just so it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
obviously still be under part just so it
can<00:00:49.430> basically<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.700> fitted<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> know

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
can basically be fitted to the you know

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
can basically be fitted to the you know
my<00:00:54.870> actual<00:00:55.260> face<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.070> jawline<00:00:56.340> than

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
my actual face and then my jawline than

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.830 
my actual face and then my jawline than
that<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.600> had<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.989> cut<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.910> see<00:01:00.180> part

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that if I had to cut if you can see part

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
that if I had to cut if you can see part
of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> ear<00:01:01.260> away<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.829> figured<00:01:01.890> out

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of the ear away because I figured out

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
of the ear away because I figured out
what<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> put<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> be

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
what I want to put it on is going to be

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.289 
what I want to put it on is going to be
like<00:01:03.989> putting<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.949> ear<00:01:05.129> back<00:01:05.309> sort<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> solids

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
like putting my ear back sort of solids

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.020 
like putting my ear back sort of solids
a<00:01:06.360> car<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.840> any<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.580> slip<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.790> like

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
a car the back any can just slip on like

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.590 
a car the back any can just slip on like
but<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:10.380> flimsy<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> matter<00:01:12.180> because

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
but it's flimsy and as a matter because

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.370 
but it's flimsy and as a matter because
I'm<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.210> use<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.240> bondo<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I'm going to use some bondo and so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
I'm going to use some bondo and so
impossible<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.040> stiffen<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.850> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
impossible to stiffen it up and I'm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.350 
impossible to stiffen it up and I'm
gonna<00:01:18.090> use<00:01:18.360> maybe<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> sort<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.520> young<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.590 

liquid<00:01:24.470> plastic<00:01:25.470> resin<00:01:26.150> eventually<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.390> were

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
liquid plastic resin eventually to were

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.700 
liquid plastic resin eventually to were
sniffing<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:29.840> any<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:30.990> idea<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
sniffing it all up any other idea of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
sniffing it all up any other idea of
what<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> want<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> because

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
what I want to do with it because

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.440 
what I want to do with it because
obviously<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:35.070> can't<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.210> head<00:01:36.329> because

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
obviously I can't put on my head because

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.160 
obviously I can't put on my head because
obviously<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.049> edge<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.710> edge<00:01:37.740> chin<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
obviously the edge the edge chin is a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.780 
obviously the edge the edge chin is a
must<00:01:40.170> once<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.770> hair<00:01:40.920> can't<00:01:41.189> fit<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.610> there

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
must once my hair can't fit in there

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520 
must once my hair can't fit in there
that<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.140> parts<00:01:43.439> on

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that so it has to like kind of parts on

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
that so it has to like kind of parts on
us<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:43.950> did<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.520> i<00:01:45.299> cut<00:01:45.899> away<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.759> head<00:01:47.759> pop

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
us all i did was i cut away the head pop

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.480 
us all i did was i cut away the head pop
from<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> jaw<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.130> where<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> red

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
from the jaw so if you see where the red

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
from the jaw so if you see where the red
is<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.240> outline<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> pink<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.350> can

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
is or the outline of the pink you can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.270 
is or the outline of the pink you can
make<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.640> across<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> face<00:01:55.280> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
make up all this here across the face to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
make up all this here across the face to
this<00:01:56.399> pink<00:01:56.729> fingers<00:01:57.090> will<00:01:57.240> work<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.780> fully

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
this pink fingers will work that's fully

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.260 
this pink fingers will work that's fully
removable<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.520> i<00:01:59.790> hear<00:02:00.509> from<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
removable and then this i hear from the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.660 
removable and then this i hear from the
the<00:02:03.270> bridge<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> nose<00:02:03.799> all<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> way<00:02:05.189> back

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
the bridge of the nose all the way back

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.550 
the bridge of the nose all the way back
to<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.939> back<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.360> skull<00:02:08.110> biz<00:02:08.319> for<00:02:08.349> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
to the back of the skull biz for the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.680 
to the back of the skull biz for the
necklines<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.580> piece<00:02:09.789> as<00:02:10.030> well<00:02:10.060> so

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
necklines that's one piece as well so

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.930 
necklines that's one piece as well so
this<00:02:10.959> would<00:02:11.170> come<00:02:11.650> off<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.160> then<00:02:12.459> all<00:02:12.730> this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
this would come off and then all this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.170 
this would come off and then all this
here<00:02:13.209> would<00:02:13.690> remove<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.349> then<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:16.090> idea

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
here would remove and then and the idea

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.120 
here would remove and then and the idea
is<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.630> I'm<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.110> give<00:02:17.349> male<00:02:17.890> and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
is that I'm going to give male and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.320 
is that I'm going to give male and
female<00:02:18.550> clips<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.090> going<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
female clips and I'm going to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.260 
female clips and I'm going to
incorporate<00:02:20.319> them<00:02:20.530> into<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.069> design<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
incorporate them into the design and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.570 
incorporate them into the design and
somehow<00:02:22.560> or<00:02:23.560> adjust<00:02:23.860> clip<00:02:24.160> something<00:02:24.489> like

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
somehow or adjust clip something like

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.180 
somehow or adjust clip something like
that<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.780> being<00:02:26.020> held<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.410> from<00:02:26.739> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that so it's being held on from the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.850 
that so it's being held on from the
front<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.060> back<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.170> there's<00:02:29.530> no<00:02:29.650> like

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
front and the back so there's no like

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.699 
front and the back so there's no like
changed<00:02:30.250> straps<00:02:30.489> or<00:02:30.700> anything<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.060> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
changed straps or anything like that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.360 
changed straps or anything like that
obviously<00:02:32.709> I'm<00:02:32.800> not<00:02:32.830> going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.100> be<00:02:33.160> able<00:02:33.190> to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
obviously I'm not going to be able to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.949 
obviously I'm not going to be able to
breathe<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:34.300> obviously<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.870> all<00:02:34.930> in

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
breathe this obviously this is all in

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.330 
breathe this obviously this is all in
the<00:02:35.080> cut<00:02:35.290> away<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.709> obviously<00:02:36.040> still

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the cut away and it's obviously still

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.070 
the cut away and it's obviously still
part<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.590> underneath<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.890> design<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
part of the underneath the design so it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.410 
part of the underneath the design so it
can<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:42.069> not<00:02:42.220> rolling<00:02:42.880> around<00:02:43.120> my

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
know not to build over Andrea join it

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.030 
know not to build over Andrea join it
with<00:03:06.459> anything<00:03:06.819> else<00:03:07.150> just<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.630> case<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.470> but

with anything else just in case but but
yeah<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> whole<00:03:09.459> thing<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:11.160> removable<00:03:12.160> so

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
yeah the whole thing is a removable so

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.780 
yeah the whole thing is a removable so
if<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.910> look<00:03:13.060> at<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.269> peels<00:03:13.989> off<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:15.609> that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
if you look at it peels off like that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.319 
if you look at it peels off like that
but<00:03:16.690> yet<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.170> other<00:03:17.290> side<00:03:17.560> as<00:03:17.709> well<00:03:18.329> and
