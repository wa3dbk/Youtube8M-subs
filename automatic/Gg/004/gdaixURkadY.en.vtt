cardboard<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.700> basically<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.210> managed<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
cardboard and I basically I managed to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.080 
cardboard and I basically I managed to
do<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> can't<00:01:37.530> believe<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.420> here

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
do it I can't believe this right here

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.899 
do it I can't believe this right here
and<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> uh<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.369> use<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> thick

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and this is uh you got to use a thick

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.310 
and this is uh you got to use a thick
corrugated<00:01:45.390> cardboard<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.840> tried<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
corrugated cardboard I tried the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.170 
corrugated cardboard I tried the
cardboard<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.100> comes<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.759> postal

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
cardboard that comes out like postal

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.969

boxes<00:01:48.479> made<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.350> wasn't<00:01:49.680> quite

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
boxes made out of this wasn't quite

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
boxes made out of this wasn't quite
thick<00:01:50.369> enough<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.850> they<00:01:51.210> would<00:01:51.360> start<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
thick enough that they would start to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.770 
thick enough that they would start to
buckle<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.390> filled<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.540> rows

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

that even the front part here there's
just<00:02:12.130> not<00:02:12.460> just<00:02:12.700> cut<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.090> each<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:14.080> piece

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
just not just cut in each of this piece

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.170 
just not just cut in each of this piece
and<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.860> two<00:02:15.040> runner<00:02:15.340> pieces<00:02:15.700> here<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.060> then

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and the two runner pieces here and then

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.820 
and the two runner pieces here and then
the<00:02:16.360> car<00:02:16.750> brush<00:02:16.930> slides<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:17.470> there<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.740> make

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the car brush slides on in there to make

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.440 
the car brush slides on in there to make
the<00:02:17.950> stopper<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.730> as<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:18.970> can<00:02:19.030> see<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.330> works

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the stopper and as you can see it works

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.140 
the stopper and as you can see it works
pretty<00:02:19.660> effectively<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.520> connect<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.030> can

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
pretty effectively and it connect it can

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.970 
pretty effectively and it connect it can
support<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.600> weight<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.350> case<00:02:23.560> I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
support the weight of all the case I

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.090 
support the weight of all the case I
need<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.820> get<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.690> little<00:02:25.930> bit<00:02:26.080> because<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.980> way

need to get a little bit because the way
I<00:02:27.130> have<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.520> angles<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.480> back<00:02:28.660> here

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
I have the angles in the back here

I have the angles in the back here
sometimes<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.620> binds<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:30.040> occasionally<00:02:30.670> and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
sometimes it binds up occasionally and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.790 
sometimes it binds up occasionally and
you<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.810> shake<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.320> get<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> next

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
you have to shake it to get the next

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
candle rolled out so but that's a design

you<00:02:37.000> may<00:02:37.180> use<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> cardboard<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.230> gotta

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
you may use a cardboard I just gotta

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.660 
you may use a cardboard I just gotta
leave<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> little<00:02:38.890> more<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.130> distance<00:02:39.550> so

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
leave a little more of a distance so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.000 
leave a little more of a distance so
that<00:02:39.790> hands<00:02:40.030> don't<00:02:40.240> get<00:02:40.360> pinched<00:02:40.650> but<00:02:41.650> as<00:02:41.860> you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
that hands don't get pinched but as you

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.050 
that hands don't get pinched but as you
can<00:02:42.100> see<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.640> proof<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.880> concept

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
can see it's just a proof of concept

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.840 
can see it's just a proof of concept
model<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:43.720> I'm<00:02:43.780> not<00:02:43.900> going<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.110> put<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
model so I'm not going to put the the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.460 
model so I'm not going to put the the
measurements<00:02:46.660> or<00:02:46.750> anything<00:02:47.020> up<00:02:47.140> there<00:02:47.260> until

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
measurements or anything up there until

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.990 
measurements or anything up there until
I<00:02:47.560> really<00:02:47.830> iron<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.489> this<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.820> it's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
I really iron it out but this is it's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.850 
I really iron it out but this is it's
extremely<00:02:49.450> easy<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.630> make<00:02:49.720> like<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.110> said<00:02:50.320> all<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
extremely easy to make like I said all I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.270 
extremely easy to make like I said all I
used<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.580> cardboard<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.900> razor<00:02:53.110> knife<00:02:53.280> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
used was cardboard and a razor knife it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.460 
used was cardboard and a razor knife it
can<00:02:54.310> hold<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> way<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.840> one<00:02:56.020> holds

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
can hold the way I think this one holds

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.270 
can hold the way I think this one holds
about<00:02:57.420> fourteen<00:02:58.420> or<00:02:58.450> fifteen<00:02:59.260> cans<00:02:59.860> when<00:03:00.100> it's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
about fourteen or fifteen cans when it's

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.860 
about fourteen or fifteen cans when it's
full<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.790> was<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.390> take<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.660> too<00:03:01.810> much

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
full I was going to take up too much

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.680 
full I was going to take up too much
space<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:03.459> stack<00:03:04.000> these<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.239> you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
space so you can stack these if you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.729 
space so you can stack these if you
could<00:03:04.840> make<00:03:04.989> as<00:03:05.140> many<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.380> these<00:03:05.440> as<00:03:05.530> you

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
could make as many of these as you

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.470 
could make as many of these as you
wanted<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.070> stack<00:03:06.280> them<00:03:06.459> side-by-side<00:03:06.700> on

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
wanted to stack them side-by-side on

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.360 
wanted to stack them side-by-side on

this<00:03:22.180> has<00:03:22.390> three<00:03:22.720> levels<00:03:23.200> right<00:03:23.410> now<00:03:23.440> you

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
this has three levels right now you

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.890 
this has three levels right now you
could<00:03:24.250> make<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.549> so<00:03:24.670> only<00:03:24.820> guess<00:03:25.000> two<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.750> can
