00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello dear audience with you in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 spoon and today in this video I wanted 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.429
 would have a little to discuss your own 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.690
 stream and talk about them but before 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.090
 I did and I will not say 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.620
 please i ask you to like 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.020
 This video because I want to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.260
 information about my streams learned how 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 you can have more people because I have everything often and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 they often ask why I 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.490
 I don't stream anymore, and where am I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 Now I spend the stream in general 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.099
 I will answer all the questions in this video 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 that's why i ask you to put 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.410
 Like so no more questions 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 was let's probably still start with 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.809
 first question why am i no longer 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.120
 I do not stream on a tuba I do not stream on a tuba 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 more because there it is very tough 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 very complicated setup I mean for 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 In order to properly stream on 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 at least 720p tub itself will need 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.890
 have at least a dicky internet 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 because for 720p 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 now of course not many will understand me 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.110
 where you need that three thousandth bitrate 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 There is if people understand in that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.340
 they will understand me very strong 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 the internet needs a very powerful one 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.869
 this is the platform where now in general 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.869
 Stream it is of course already the answer to the second 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.780
 question on no matter there for 720p need 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.200
 only 1,200 bit rate 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.119
 this is so small that pipets there 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.860
 even with weak internet you can stream 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.689
 in good quality 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.780
 oh well now we still answer 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.430
 on the first question but in general besides 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.680
 This I do not stream on the tube now 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.990
 because there is a very complicated setup 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.560
 there you need to put all sorts of codes then vx 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.630
 whip 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 and after you put it all up 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.030
 run wait 10 minutes bye 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 youtube will handle all this 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 on time on the button there is a special all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.509
 this will again be processed later 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.299
 you need to press one button and only 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.880
 only then in a minute will the stream start 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.399
 on y tube this delay on y tube will 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.239
 somewhere a whole minute she can 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.860
 exhibited yes grandfather from 30 minutes 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.319
 Can you imagine that I will tell you now 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.050
 something during the microphone stream you 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.090
 can probably hear somewhere through 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.450
 minute or 30 minutes this is go nuts 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 very bad in my opinion and in general 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 that's why I'm not streaming on 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 yu tube is the answer to the first question and 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.480
 now proceed to the second where am I 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.670
 and as I said, I strive 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.190
 now on the twitch platform if that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.330
 a link to my twitch channel you can 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.190
 see in the description 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.599
 I won't talk about this anymore 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.900
 speak because much PR is not 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.400
 I want my channel and why do I stream on 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.560
 twitch 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.030
 because there as I said earlier 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.040
 to stream in good 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.769
 karting buried in good quality 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.190
 not necessary to have a cool internet yes 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.140
 it is a plus of twitch besides all that there 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.110
 delay of only 5 seconds 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.480
 default and it never grows like on 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.760
 yu tuba, that is, if I stream something 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.040
 I will say into the microphone in hear it already 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.610
 somewhere in 45 seconds it's just damn 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.239
 cool you can not know the online show and 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.060
 create and here it is plus awesome plus 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.430
 for all that twitch is such 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.659
 awesome platform thanks to which 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.950
 But you can read the comments easily. 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.920
 when yu tuba 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.739
 comments, updates take place at th 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.590
 how awful is there fig what do you read fig 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.239
 answer the questions is just bad yes 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.610
 so I am now generally streaming 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:44.019
 twitch third question how often do I stream 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.200
 I'm probably trying to stream 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.150
 four five times a week and about 2 or 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.230
 3 of these four streams may be 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.930
 just commonplace 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.330
 Well, as banal spontaneous that is, I 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.310
 just sat down at the computer decided something 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.019
 I quickly switch on 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.540
 triche there at all without any problems 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.670
 clicked a button and went stream 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.970
 what is there on some yu tuba stream 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.349
 that's all fine you earned 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.610
 you start to stream played in 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.039
 any toy for example in 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.660
 minkravt on highpixel and finished stream 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.799
 fine but one of the four streams I already 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.080
 I agree with everyone I ask 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.960
 and what do i play blah blah blah what are we 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.620
 we will do in stream and so on then 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.110
 there is as i said one of the four 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.690
 I have good streams a week 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.789
 It turns out well in my opinion I do not know 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.470
 how do you think there is but 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.190
 actually three questions that I would like 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.830
 reply 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.410
 as I said link to my twitch 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.930
 I will leave the channel in the description there 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.930
 check and 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.580
 Yes, you can in the general test that sometimes 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.750
 stumble on my stream 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.460
 but now Iâ€™ve probably ripened immediately 4 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.490
 a question that you could ask me 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.669
 is it possible to find out about streams 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.200
 you can even know in advance then 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.110
 when the stream just started 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.090
 You can now follow the second link. 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.849
 which is in the description there you can 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.870
 download a special browser plugin 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.340
 your google chrome or mozilla firefox 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.030
 I do not know what browser you are 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.750
 are using 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.180
 and when you download this plugin 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.770
 set it just in two clicks it 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.260
 there are no applications needed 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.080
 Download just click all 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.849
 the plugin is installed and when you will 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.870
 be in the browser if you have 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.960
 internet connected 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.539
 you can when i start my stream 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.240
 find out what stream started with you just 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.830
 there will be highlighted in the little corner there 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.640
 such ikonochka 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:53.840
 very small icon but i think you 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.550
 see it and you can click on 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.980
 this ikonochku sorry the fact that sometimes 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.670
 squeaky and all yes you will go to my 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.260
 stream that just started me 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.680
 I think I answered all the questions 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.720
 4 I came up with it spontaneously but maybe 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.230
 to whom it will come in handy all the links will be in 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.630
 description more hope questions not 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.640
 will be as I have already asked in advance 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.340
 please like this information 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.180
 I learned as many people as possible I shot 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:30.110
 this video was at two in the morning so 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.060
 stumble a bit yes thanks 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.420
 I watched this video I hope the information 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.580
 for you it was more or less important if you 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.530
 Of course, at least once watched my stream 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.070
 or want to watch my stream 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:47.410
 Well, you had a spoon and this video 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.410
 good luck everyone all bye
