00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
for well one of the first things to look

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
for well one of the first things to look
for<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> quality<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.040> manufacture<00:01:59.700> if<00:02:00.060> all

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
is where it's supposed to be

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.170 
is where it's supposed to be
if<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.619> switchgear<00:02:04.920> feels<00:02:05.520> good<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
if that breaks feel good you can tell a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.080 
if that breaks feel good you can tell a
lot<00:02:10.740> about<00:02:10.770> quality<00:02:11.400> by<00:02:11.640> looking<00:02:11.940> at<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
lot about quality by looking at a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.410 
lot about quality by looking at a
scooter<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.530> peace<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.160> mind<00:02:14.370> comes<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.180> a
