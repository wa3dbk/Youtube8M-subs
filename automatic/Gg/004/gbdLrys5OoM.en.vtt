00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.960
 hey people what will fitness will be here and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.389
 Welcome to this video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.010
 important in this video just the series 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.940
 briefly introducing it very briefly 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.730
 And that's what she's about to do 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.090
 mobility means flexibility 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.949
 agility performance muscle almost 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.420
 every bonding and so on has 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.269
 maybe it is already seen in areas 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
 and I would like to work again 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.529
 the basis for this year is that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.480
 book by cayston red who does not know it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.350
 Look at the video that's it 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.390
 video here before 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 i want the whole thing in a playlist 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 and to my job there is the book 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 if you want to buy something and what you want 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.350
 needs for this series so in the strip 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.020
 uses a lot of different ones 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.050
 Variations of things in his book what 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.360
 we will use is one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.570
 I think this is the most expensive one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 that's the one from britta so you have to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.559
 not enough show reality yes 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.470
 also every shop in the shop three 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.570
 different before mason the blue one 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.290
 for 15 euros then the black bull for 30 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.820
 and the almost 45 euros for this 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.960
 I got the other one for 540 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.369
 Euro brought because I thought so 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.939
 I can only manage one 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.650
 but it does just as well the blackhawks 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.299
 and the other think, too 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.229
 I do not know exactly but I do 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:34.530
 Let 's guess what we use 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:37.710
 is one naked if not now 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.939
 peanuts have you and I want to buy something 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.770
 i did i have two 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.479
 used tennis balls and those with 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 Tape together you can 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 of course, as well as what else 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.420
 it would be better in the american area 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.750
 use a cross ball as you will 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.670
 I'm forward-looking otherwise 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.940
 everything you have the form of tennis 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.650
 Baseball in the precious with the ball 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.180
 Living together has the alpine you can 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.520
 of course also individual lacrosse 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.780
 I do not use it myself now 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.240
 but of course you can do that as well 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.560
 use and what we have some videos 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.880
 Need him, of course, too 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.729
 Divide for the people at home 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.590
 I used no bands and for the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.610
 people who study have the tapes 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 can moor 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.550
 I also use bender this is 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.980
 now gray band back if mine 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.000
 studio has these green ribbons he the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 I turn to me, however 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.680
 I want to get it here at home 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.180
 even a bit that makes him without 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.280
 It would have to be able to fix it 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840
 I will use these pictures too 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.790
 These tapes are also in shock 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 linked I think I'm doing one 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.020
 own mobility shop there you will find the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.720
 things then even extra time the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.040
 If you want to buy something there 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.840
 Can not you like Amazon? 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.680
 support those are the three things 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.989
 which we need and need 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 and my friends 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.920
 now could learn what we do 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.420
 mobility and I would say we see 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 us in the next video when it says 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.760
