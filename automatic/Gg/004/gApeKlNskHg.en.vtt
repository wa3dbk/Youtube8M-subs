the same tool and use something similar
to<00:01:22.790> like<00:01:23.790> oh<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.560> porting

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
stone you know just just different ways

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.530 
stone you know just just different ways
of<00:01:31.619> doing<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.360> quick

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
of doing I like this because it's quick

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
of doing I like this because it's quick
easy<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> efficient<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:35.040> during<00:01:35.340> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
easy and efficient now during this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
easy and efficient now during this
process<00:01:35.700> probably<00:01:36.450> my<00:01:36.600> compressor<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.229> going

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
process probably my compressor is going

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.270 
process probably my compressor is going
to<00:01:37.439> kick<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.930> yeah<00:01:39.930> we'll<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.860> cut<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
to kick on so yeah we'll just cut the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.039 
to kick on so yeah we'll just cut the
sound<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.820> point<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
sound at that point but you get a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.569 
sound at that point but you get a
general<00:01:43.409> idea<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.710> what's<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
general idea of what's going on of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.980 
general idea of what's going on of
course<00:01:44.640> whenever<00:01:45.030> using<00:01:45.420> spinning<00:01:45.810> power

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
course whenever using spinning power

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630 
course whenever using spinning power
tools<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.560> things<00:01:46.860> could<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.220> wrong<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
tools where things could go wrong and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
tools where things could go wrong and
stuff<00:01:47.820> could<00:01:48.000> fly<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.360> face<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:49.590> always

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
stuff could fly in your face it's always

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.969 
stuff could fly in your face it's always
a<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.159> idea<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.759> glasses<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.979> all

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.580 
you put use a whole lot of force but I'm
just<00:02:10.330> going<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.540> go<00:02:10.690> along<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.960> blade<00:02:11.290> here

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
just going to go along the blade here

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
just going to go along the blade here
and<00:02:13.170> basically<00:02:14.170> smooth<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.040> out<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> knife

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and basically smooth it out like a knife

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.460 
and basically smooth it out like a knife
edge<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.210> when<00:02:16.330> I'm<00:02:16.420> done<00:02:16.600> I'm<00:02:17.260> going<00:02:17.410> to

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
edge and then when I'm done I'm going to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:32.870 
edge and then when I'm done I'm going to
flip<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.740> over<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.250> from<00:02:19.180> there

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.220 

ah<00:02:35.090> okay<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> show<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.660> real<00:02:36.900> quick<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
ah okay just to show you real quick the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.910 
ah okay just to show you real quick the
idea<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:39.390> try<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.840> get<00:02:40.050> rid<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.620> these

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
idea is to try to get rid of all these

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.310 
idea is to try to get rid of all these
little<00:02:41.130> chunks<00:02:41.960> there's<00:02:42.960> many<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.260> these

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
little chunks there's many of these

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.530 
little chunks there's many of these
little<00:02:43.620> chunks<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> end<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.420> then

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
little chunks out in the end and then

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.150 
little chunks out in the end and then
when<00:02:45.690> I'm<00:02:45.810> done<00:02:45.840> I'm<00:02:46.110> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> flip<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.920> over

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
when I'm done I'm going to flip it over

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.830 
when I'm done I'm going to flip it over
and<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.300> side<00:02:48.770> but<00:02:50.240> that's<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.480> idea

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
and do this side but that's the idea

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.840 
and do this side but that's the idea
there<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> we'll<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.230> side<00:02:55.650> we'll<00:02:56.520> do<00:02:56.640> one

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
there so we'll do one side we'll do one

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.310 
there so we'll do one side we'll do one
side<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.270> we'll<00:02:57.360> file<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:57.780> down<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.230> where

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
side and we'll file this down to where

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.810 
side and we'll file this down to where
we<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.590> rid<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.950> bumps<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.700> we'll

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
we get rid of the bumps and then we'll

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.490 
we get rid of the bumps and then we'll
do<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.030> other<00:03:00.060> side<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.050> been<00:03:01.230> some

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
do the other side and it's been some

00:03:01.500 --> 00:04:10.199 
do the other side and it's been some
time<00:03:01.530> since<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.310> been<00:03:02.520> sharpened

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.339 

all<00:04:11.209> right<00:04:11.440> um<00:04:12.760> as<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:14.000> can<00:04:14.090> see<00:04:14.300> I've<00:04:15.170> got<00:04:15.290> a

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
all right um as you can see I've got a

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.310 
all right um as you can see I've got a
nice<00:04:15.530> clean<00:04:16.160> edge<00:04:16.190> here<00:04:16.910> as<00:04:17.570> opposed<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.109> what

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
nice clean edge here as opposed to what

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.800 
nice clean edge here as opposed to what
I<00:04:18.350> used<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.739> have<00:04:18.919> which<00:04:19.130> was<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.660> I'm<00:04:20.660> going

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
I used to have which was that I'm going

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.170 
I used to have which was that I'm going
to<00:04:20.840> go<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.109> do<00:04:21.200> this<00:04:21.350> side<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:23.360> yes<00:04:24.970> go<00:04:25.970> from

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
to go and do this side but yes go from

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.250 
to go and do this side but yes go from
this<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:30.639> then<00:04:31.639> you<00:04:31.730> can<00:04:31.910> hop<00:04:32.780> and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
this to this and then you can hop and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.010 
this to this and then you can hop and
this<00:04:33.380> is<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.560> mulching<00:04:33.950> blade<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:35.020> remember

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
this is a mulching blade so remember

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.780 
this is a mulching blade so remember
which<00:04:36.169> way<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.500> thing<00:04:36.710> went<00:04:36.889> on<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.669> can

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
which way the thing went on and you can

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.250 
which way the thing went on and you can
see<00:04:37.940> like<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.270> big<00:04:38.450> block<00:04:38.660> here<00:04:38.960> where<00:04:39.169> you

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
see like this big block here where you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.659 
see like this big block here where you
don't<00:04:39.440> see<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.740> on<00:04:39.800> this<00:04:40.010> side<00:04:40.220> you<00:04:40.370> know<00:04:40.490> that

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
don't see it on this side you know that

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.850 
don't see it on this side you know that
just<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:41.000> bolt<00:04:41.240> goes<00:04:41.510> on<00:04:41.690> here<00:04:41.960> because<00:04:42.740> if

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
just this bolt goes on here because if

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.379 
just this bolt goes on here because if
you<00:04:42.950> don't<00:04:43.130> put<00:04:43.280> these<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:43.610> correctly<00:04:44.180> it

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
you don't put these on correctly it

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.890 
you don't put these on correctly it
won't<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.900> won't<00:04:45.380> cut<00:04:45.680> correctly<00:04:46.540> anyway<00:04:47.540> um

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
won't it won't cut correctly anyway um

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.500 
won't it won't cut correctly anyway um
and<00:04:48.530> also<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:49.760> know<00:04:49.880> while<00:04:50.180> you're<00:04:50.330> at<00:04:50.479> it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
and also you know while you're at it

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.460 
and also you know while you're at it
it's<00:04:50.810> probably<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.260> good<00:04:51.350> idea<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:53.750> see<00:04:53.960> if<00:04:54.080> it's

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
it's probably a good idea to see if it's

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.270 
it's probably a good idea to see if it's
bent<00:04:54.830> or<00:04:55.720> unbalanced<00:04:56.720> in<00:04:56.840> any<00:04:56.990> way<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:58.220> can

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
bent or unbalanced in any way you can

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.950 
bent or unbalanced in any way you can
put<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.669> like<00:04:58.910> balance<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.479> like<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.720> nail

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
put it like balance it on like a nail

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.540 
put it like balance it on like a nail
head<00:05:00.229> on<00:05:00.410> just<00:05:00.590> use<00:05:00.680> my<00:05:00.860> finger<00:05:01.160> here<00:05:01.340> like

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
head on just use my finger here like

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.640 
head on just use my finger here like
this<00:05:01.760> but<00:05:02.540> if<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.750> starts<00:05:02.990> like<00:05:03.290> leaning

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
this but if it starts like leaning

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.310 
this but if it starts like leaning
towards<00:05:03.919> one<00:05:04.010> side<00:05:04.370> really<00:05:04.790> bad<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:06.080> might<00:05:06.200> be

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
towards one side really bad it might be

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.350 
towards one side really bad it might be
time<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.530> replace<00:05:06.889> that<00:05:07.130> blade<00:05:07.400> or<00:05:07.790> if<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.210> see

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
time to replace that blade or if you see

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.780 
time to replace that blade or if you see
the<00:05:08.479> blade<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.900> like<00:05:09.110> really<00:05:09.410> bent<00:05:09.770> over<00:05:09.919> not

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
the blade is like really bent over not

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.390 
the blade is like really bent over not
good<00:05:11.030> just<00:05:11.410> just<00:05:12.410> replace<00:05:12.740> those<00:05:12.950> no<00:05:13.190> bother

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
good just just replace those no bother

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.930 
good just just replace those no bother
sharpening<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:15.169> does<00:05:15.320> happen<00:05:15.710> but<00:05:15.950> anyway

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
sharpening and it does happen but anyway

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.230 
sharpening and it does happen but anyway
