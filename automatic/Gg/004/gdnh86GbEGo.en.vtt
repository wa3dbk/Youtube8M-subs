perspective<00:00:36.370> it's<00:00:37.059> nice<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.629> have<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.809> blank

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
perspective it's nice to have a blank

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.020 
perspective it's nice to have a blank
surface<00:00:38.829> that<00:00:39.070> if<00:00:39.190> you<00:00:39.309> want<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.519> put<00:00:39.699> letters

surface that if you want to put letters
on<00:00:40.179> the<00:00:40.269> outside<00:00:40.809> it's<00:00:41.350> not<00:00:41.499> so<00:00:41.679> confusing

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
on the outside it's not so confusing

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.799 
on the outside it's not so confusing
with<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.579> picture<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.089> the<00:00:43.179> other<00:00:43.359> letters

with the picture and the other letters

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.869 
with the picture and the other letters
underneath<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:44.890> it's<00:00:45.039> just<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.309> nice<00:00:45.489> clean

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
underneath so it's just a nice clean

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.319 
underneath so it's just a nice clean
blank<00:00:46.629> surface<00:00:47.079> that<00:00:47.739> he<00:00:47.920> can<00:00:48.219> use<00:00:48.909> to<00:00:48.940> start

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
blank surface that he can use to start

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.020 
blank surface that he can use to start
building<00:00:49.749> some<00:00:50.440> words<00:00:50.649> if<00:00:50.890> he<00:00:51.069> chooses<00:00:51.699> to<00:00:51.730> do

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030
