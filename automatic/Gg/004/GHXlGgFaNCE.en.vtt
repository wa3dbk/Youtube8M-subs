hi<00:00:06.290> guys<00:00:06.560> welcome<00:00:07.279> to<00:00:07.520> another<00:00:07.730> blog

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
hi guys welcome to another blog

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.600 
hi guys welcome to another blog
spotlight<00:00:08.630> and<00:00:09.010> today<00:00:10.010> we're<00:00:10.340> going<00:00:10.430> to<00:00:10.520> be

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
spotlight and today we're going to be

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.539 
spotlight and today we're going to be
having<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:11.150> look<00:00:11.450> at<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:12.260> dimensional<00:00:13.070> anchor

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
having a look at the dimensional anchor

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.480 
having a look at the dimensional anchor
now<00:00:14.360> this<00:00:14.780> is<00:00:15.789> modern<00:00:16.789> itself<00:00:17.150> that<00:00:17.390> just<00:00:17.600> adds

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
now this is modern itself that just adds

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.490 
now this is modern itself that just adds
chunk<00:00:19.490> loader<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.510> that's<00:00:20.869> what<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:21.230> block

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
chunk loader and that's what this block

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.590 
chunk loader and that's what this block
is<00:00:21.710> here<00:00:22.040> so<00:00:22.640> it's<00:00:22.820> not<00:00:23.000> really<00:00:23.510> a<00:00:25.240> it's<00:00:26.240> just<00:00:26.360> a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
is here so it's not really a it's just a

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.790 
is here so it's not really a it's just a
block<00:00:26.840> that<00:00:27.080> you're<00:00:27.200> going<00:00:27.350> to<00:00:27.410> need<00:00:27.620> to<00:00:27.770> use

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
block that you're going to need to use

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.430 
block that you're going to need to use
if<00:00:28.370> you<00:00:28.670> have<00:00:28.910> some<00:00:29.150> automation<00:00:29.570> running<00:00:30.170> in

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
if you have some automation running in

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.520 
if you have some automation running in
an<00:00:30.560> area<00:00:30.950> and<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:31.910> need<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.360> keep<00:00:32.570> those<00:00:32.899> those

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
an area and you need to keep those those

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.209 
an area and you need to keep those those
chunks<00:00:33.920> loaded<00:00:34.309> for<00:00:34.550> whatever<00:00:34.730> reason<00:00:35.300> just

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
chunks loaded for whatever reason just

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.529 
chunks loaded for whatever reason just
to<00:00:37.219> keep<00:00:37.370> your<00:00:37.489> processes<00:00:38.030> running<00:00:38.239> when

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
to keep your processes running when

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.759 
to keep your processes running when
you're<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:40.070> not<00:00:40.339> need<00:00:40.579> your<00:00:40.730> base<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.559> now<00:00:42.559> it

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
you're you not need your base and now it

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.309 
you're you not need your base and now it
is<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.010> dimensional<00:00:43.819> anchor<00:00:44.179> so<00:00:44.390> work

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:45.319 
is a dimensional anchor so work

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.579 
is a dimensional anchor so work
cross<00:00:45.649> cross<00:00:46.309> dimensionally<00:00:46.999> and<00:00:47.589> it's

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
cross cross dimensionally and it's

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.229 
cross cross dimensionally and it's
actually<00:00:50.409> quite<00:00:51.409> useful<00:00:51.890> block<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.670> have<00:00:52.909> it's

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
actually quite useful block to have it's

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.419 
actually quite useful block to have it's
a<00:00:53.539> little<00:00:53.870> bit<00:00:53.989> more<00:00:54.140> configurable<00:00:54.920> than<00:00:55.190> some

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
a little bit more configurable than some

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.219 
a little bit more configurable than some
of<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.640> other<00:00:57.069> chunk<00:00:58.089> anchors<00:00:59.089> chunk<00:00:59.899> loader

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
of the other chunk anchors chunk loader

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.939 
of the other chunk anchors chunk loader
blocks<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:01.010> are<00:01:01.989> around<00:01:02.989> another<00:01:03.260> mods<00:01:03.559> like

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
blocks that are around another mods like

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.100 
blocks that are around another mods like
for<00:01:04.250> instance<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.030> world<00:01:05.600> anchoring

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
for instance the the world anchoring

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.220 
for instance the the world anchoring
railcraft<00:01:06.470> although<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:08.360> particular<00:01:08.720> world

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230

railcraft although that particular world
anchor<00:01:09.710> chug<00:01:10.250> loader<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:11.710> able<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.770> put<00:01:12.920> that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
anchor chug loader is able to put that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.490 
anchor chug loader is able to put that
in<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.190> car<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.640> having<00:01:13.790> mobile<00:01:14.300> that's<00:01:15.230> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
in a car and having mobile that's the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.900 
in a car and having mobile that's the
advantage<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:16.220> one<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:16.700> one's

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
advantage of that one this one's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.790 
advantage of that one this one's
advantage<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.720> if<00:01:18.110> we<00:01:18.290> have<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.470> look<00:01:18.620> at<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
advantage is if we have a look at the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.530 
advantage is if we have a look at the
interface<00:01:19.210> I'll<00:01:20.210> be<00:01:20.330> able<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.570> see<00:01:22.180> as<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.390> can

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
interface I'll be able to see as you can

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.660 
interface I'll be able to see as you can
see<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:24.140> telling<00:01:24.560> us<00:01:24.590> at<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.860> moment<00:01:25.040> that

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
see it's telling us at the moment that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.400 
see it's telling us at the moment that
the<00:01:25.880> owner<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.600> me<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:29.060> have<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.630> chunk<00:01:30.140> limit

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
the owner is me and I have a chunk limit

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.160 
the owner is me and I have a chunk limit
now<00:01:30.590> if<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.890> were<00:01:31.010> working<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.610> server<00:01:32.170> you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
now if you were working on a server you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.810 
now if you were working on a server you
can<00:01:33.380> configure<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.880> chunk<00:01:35.840> limit<00:01:36.260> or<00:01:36.610> limit<00:01:37.610> on

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
can configure a chunk limit or limit on

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.880 
can configure a chunk limit or limit on
how<00:01:38.150> many<00:01:38.210> chunks<00:01:38.600> each<00:01:39.140> player<00:01:39.440> can<00:01:39.710> keep

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
how many chunks each player can keep

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.060 
how many chunks each player can keep
load<00:01:40.100> at<00:01:40.250> any<00:01:40.460> one<00:01:40.700> time<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:41.620> this<00:01:42.620> here<00:01:42.920> would

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
load at any one time and this here would

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.130 
load at any one time and this here would
tell<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:44.080> how<00:01:45.080> how<00:01:46.240> far<00:01:47.240> off<00:01:47.510> enemy<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.440> are

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
tell you how how far off enemy you are

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.420 
tell you how how far off enemy you are
and<00:01:52.930> as<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.110> can<00:01:54.200> see<00:01:54.410> we'll<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:54.800> tell<00:01:55.310> you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
and as you can see we'll just tell you

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.490 
and as you can see we'll just tell you
what<00:01:55.640> area<00:01:56.060> here<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.420> it's<00:01:56.900> loading<00:01:57.260> so<00:01:57.410> at

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
what area here that it's loading so at

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.280 
what area here that it's loading so at
the<00:01:57.560> moment<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.040> is<00:01:58.250> loading<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:59.480> single

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the moment this is loading a single

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.610 
the moment this is loading a single
chunk<00:02:00.590> now<00:02:01.550> if<00:02:01.730> we<00:02:02.000> use<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.750> two<00:02:03.020> bands<00:02:03.260> here

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
chunk now if we use these two bands here

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.080 
chunk now if we use these two bands here
this<00:02:04.280> one<00:02:04.490> here<00:02:04.850> will<00:02:05.840> shrink<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:07.100> area<00:02:07.460> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
this one here will shrink the area and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.479 
this one here will shrink the area and
this<00:02:08.300> one<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.869> will<00:02:09.470> expand<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:10.310> if<00:02:10.369> we

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
this one here will expand it so if we

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.160 
this one here will expand it so if we
click<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.819> once<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:11.810> up<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.140> a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
click it once it's going to go up to a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.770 
click it once it's going to go up to a
three<00:02:12.440> by<00:02:12.620> three<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.730> tell<00:02:14.270> us<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.630> we're

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
three by three and tell us that we're

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.660 
three by three and tell us that we're
now<00:02:15.020> using<00:02:15.850> nine<00:02:16.850> chunks<00:02:17.390> out<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.690> our<00:02:17.870> limit

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
now using nine chunks out of our limit

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.260 
now using nine chunks out of our limit
and<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:19.750> up<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> five<00:02:20.200> by<00:02:20.440> five<00:02:21.090> you'll<00:02:22.090> see

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
and so go up to five by five you'll see

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.010 
and so go up to five by five you'll see
25<00:02:23.130> 7<00:02:24.130> by<00:02:24.250> 7<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.450> 49<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.890> then<00:02:27.040> 9<00:02:27.310> by<00:02:27.520> 9<00:02:28.020> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
25 7 by 7 this is 49 and then 9 by 9 to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.130 
25 7 by 7 this is 49 and then 9 by 9 to
give<00:02:29.140> us<00:02:29.230> 81<00:02:29.860> chunks<00:02:30.310> loaded<00:02:30.760> off<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.450> single

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
give us 81 chunks loaded off of a single

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.449 
give us 81 chunks loaded off of a single
chunk<00:02:32.380> loader<00:02:34.650> which<00:02:35.650> can<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.040> quite<00:02:36.220> useful

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
chunk loader which can be quite useful

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.820 
chunk loader which can be quite useful
can<00:02:37.030> also<00:02:37.240> be<00:02:37.570> quite<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.870> drain<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.200> your<00:02:38.350> system

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
can also be quite a drain on your system

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.750 
can also be quite a drain on your system
if<00:02:39.010> you're<00:02:40.020> if<00:02:41.020> that's<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.950> concern<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.430> yours

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
if you're if that's the concern of yours

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.600 
if you're if that's the concern of yours
then<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:44.440> aware<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.950> probably<00:02:45.250> want<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.520> keep

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
then be aware you probably want to keep

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.360 
then be aware you probably want to keep
these<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.800> small<00:02:47.800> an<00:02:48.580> area<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:49.120> possible<00:02:50.370> we've

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
these as small an area as possible we've

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.460 
these as small an area as possible we've
also<00:02:51.520> got<00:02:51.760> another<00:02:51.790> button<00:02:52.360> down<00:02:52.540> here<00:02:52.570> which

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
also got another button down here which

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.080 
also got another button down here which
will<00:02:53.680> allow<00:02:53.920> us<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.100> set<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> owner<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
will allow us to set the owner to the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
will allow us to set the owner to the
server<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:58.600> way<00:02:59.220> it's<00:03:00.220> going<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.930> keep<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
server that way it's going to keep it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.440 
server that way it's going to keep it
loaded<00:03:02.350> even<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.400> even<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:04.000> you're<00:03:04.209> not

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
loaded even if it's even if you're not

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.910 
loaded even if it's even if you're not
around<00:03:07.620> otherwise<00:03:08.620> what<00:03:09.280> will<00:03:09.430> happen<00:03:09.910> is

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
around otherwise what will happen is

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.509 
around otherwise what will happen is
when<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.040> log<00:03:12.250> off<00:03:13.260> your<00:03:14.260> chunks<00:03:14.830> will<00:03:15.040> will

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
when you log off your chunks will will

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.949 
when you log off your chunks will will
unload<00:03:17.430> which<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.850> important<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.630> if<00:03:19.840> you

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
unload which is important to know if you

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.320 
unload which is important to know if you
want<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.170> server<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.739> mean<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.400> way<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
want a server I mean that way the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.030 
want a server I mean that way the
server's<00:03:22.750> not<00:03:22.959> being<00:03:23.820> overly<00:03:24.820> taxed<00:03:25.360> if

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
server's not being overly taxed if

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.670 
server's not being overly taxed if
people<00:03:27.040> aren't<00:03:27.489> online<00:03:27.900> for<00:03:28.900> an<00:03:29.170> extended

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
people aren't online for an extended

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.650 
people aren't online for an extended
period<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:30.040> time

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
period of time

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.420 
period of time
so<00:03:31.660> really<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.200> it's<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.650> very<00:03:32.680> very<00:03:33.220> useful

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
so really it's it's a very very useful

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.970 
so really it's it's a very very useful
thing<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.329> have<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.750> place<00:03:34.780> as<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.320> server<00:03:35.709> owner

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
thing to have in place as a server owner

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.970 
thing to have in place as a server owner
or<00:03:36.280> someone<00:03:36.730> who<00:03:36.880> had<00:03:37.060> means<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.390> server<00:03:37.980> you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
or someone who had means a server you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.190 
or someone who had means a server you
can<00:03:39.160> also<00:03:39.340> set<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> owner<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.390> as<00:03:40.540> well<00:03:40.860> so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
can also set the owner to you as well so

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.509 
can also set the owner to you as well so
that's<00:03:45.329> pretty<00:03:46.329> useful<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:47.019> other<00:03:47.380> thing<00:03:47.739> to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
that's pretty useful the other thing to

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.090 
that's pretty useful the other thing to
do<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.970> once<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.570> are<00:03:49.600> loading<00:03:50.320> chunks<00:03:50.769> if<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
do is once you are loading chunks if you

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.960 
do is once you are loading chunks if you
press<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.640> f9<00:03:52.000> key<00:03:52.920> what<00:03:53.920> we<00:03:54.040> can<00:03:54.250> see<00:03:54.459> here<00:03:54.760> is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
press the f9 key what we can see here is

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.360 
press the f9 key what we can see here is
you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.049> see<00:03:57.120> where<00:03:58.120> your<00:03:58.299> chunks<00:03:58.750> are<00:03:58.900> loaded

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
you can see where your chunks are loaded

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.819 
you can see where your chunks are loaded
with<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.519> laser<00:04:01.030> lines<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:01.930> defaults<00:04:02.680> to

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
with the laser lines so that defaults to

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.300 
with the laser lines so that defaults to
f9<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:04.420> can<00:04:04.570> see<00:04:04.810> in<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.110> sky<00:04:05.530> as<00:04:05.590> well<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
f9 you can see in the sky as well the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.440 
f9 you can see in the sky as well the
limits<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.459> as<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.760> can<00:04:09.880> see<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.239> is

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
limits of that so as you can see this is

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.979 
limits of that so as you can see this is
loading<00:04:10.840> up<00:04:10.959> quite<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.440> large<00:04:11.769> area<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:13.780> by

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
loading up quite a large area just by

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.949 
loading up quite a large area just by
itself<00:04:14.320> you<00:04:14.739> can<00:04:14.920> also<00:04:15.070> see<00:04:15.700> exactly<00:04:16.690> where

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
itself you can also see exactly where

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.110 
itself you can also see exactly where
your<00:04:16.989> chunks<00:04:17.500> are<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:18.310> chunk<00:04:18.640> you're<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:18.970> is

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
your chunks are the chunk you're in is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.180 
your chunks are the chunk you're in is
clear<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:19.919> then<00:04:20.919> all<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.220> others<00:04:21.489> are<00:04:21.700> blue

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.940 

and<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.570> said<00:04:28.140> you<00:04:28.470> can<00:04:28.650> shrink<00:04:28.830> that

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
and that's a said you can shrink that

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.920 
and that's a said you can shrink that
back<00:04:29.220> down<00:04:29.430> with<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.240> only<00:04:30.480> loading

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
back down with this so it's only loading

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.180 
back down with this so it's only loading
the<00:04:31.080> one<00:04:31.290> chunk<00:04:33.290> should<00:04:34.290> probably<00:04:34.530> need<00:04:34.980> to

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
the one chunk should probably need to

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.420 
the one chunk should probably need to
toggle<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.880> f9<00:04:36.360> again<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:38.130> as<00:04:38.280> you

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
toggle the f9 again for that so as you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.490 
toggle the f9 again for that so as you
can<00:04:38.550> see<00:04:38.610> these<00:04:38.880> green<00:04:39.360> lines<00:04:39.690> showing<00:04:40.350> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
can see these green lines showing you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.590 
can see these green lines showing you
your<00:04:40.710> one<00:04:40.920> chunk<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:41.550> going<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.790> keep<00:04:41.940> loaded

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.520 

very<00:04:45.600> very<00:04:45.840> useful<00:04:46.020> also<00:04:47.960> what<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.140> will<00:04:49.290> note

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
very very useful also what you will note

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.550 
very very useful also what you will note
is<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.610> chunk<00:04:50.940> loader<00:04:51.210> itself<00:04:51.630> glows<00:04:52.080> so

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
is that the chunk loader itself glows so

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.480 
is that the chunk loader itself glows so
if<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:53.970> were<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.840> for<00:04:55.170> instance<00:04:55.500> very<00:04:55.590> junk

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
if we were to for instance very junk

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.890 
if we were to for instance very junk
loader<00:04:59.090> up<00:05:00.090> down<00:05:00.360> there<00:05:00.630> for<00:05:00.960> instance<00:05:02.900> I'm

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900

are<00:05:29.840> particularly<00:05:30.840> useful<00:05:31.230> if<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.830> are<00:05:31.860> a

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
are particularly useful if you are a

are particularly useful if you are a
server<00:05:34.230> admin<00:05:35.960> but<00:05:36.960> there<00:05:37.410> we<00:05:37.500> go

that's<00:05:38.930> that's<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.050> dimensional<00:05:40.560> anchor<00:05:40.890> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
that's that's the dimensional anchor the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.290 
that's that's the dimensional anchor the
recipe<00:05:41.820> for<00:05:42.110> is<00:05:43.110> it's<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.860> block<00:05:44.070> of<00:05:44.190> iron<00:05:44.370> with

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
recipe for is it's a block of iron with

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.730 
recipe for is it's a block of iron with
four<00:05:45.840> gold<00:05:46.110> around<00:05:46.230> it

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
four gold around it

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.710 
four gold around it
so<00:05:47.430> not<00:05:48.150> particularly<00:05:48.540> expensive<00:05:49.280> but<00:05:50.280> it<00:05:50.430> is

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
so not particularly expensive but it is

I<00:06:09.930> actually<00:06:10.169> prefer<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:10.919> one<00:06:11.190> now<00:06:11.430> over<00:06:12.090> some

of the others I've tried rather than

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
just being cheap just the fact that I
