this is not my only product that I use
in<00:01:48.009> my<00:01:48.100> hair<00:01:48.280> because<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.939> does<00:01:49.149> not<00:01:49.299> have<00:01:49.359> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
hole that I like but what it does do is

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.669 
hole that I like but what it does do is
I<00:01:53.619> use<00:01:54.130> gel<00:01:54.490> later<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:55.899> helps<00:01:56.319> so<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
I use gel later on so this helps so the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.849 
I use gel later on so this helps so the
gel<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.189> not<00:01:57.520> hard<00:01:58.060> or<00:01:58.539> very<00:01:58.569> crunchy<00:01:59.409> because

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
gel is not hard or very crunchy because

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.249 
gel is not hard or very crunchy because

about maybe like an inch and a half
section<00:02:50.490> starting<00:02:51.120> from<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.420> bottom<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:53.160> can

eyeball<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.880> mean<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> doesn't<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.540> be

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
eyeball it I mean it doesn't have to be

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.030 
eyeball it I mean it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.110> don't<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.620> out<00:02:55.800> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the ruler on have to measure it you just

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.390 
the ruler on have to measure it you just
kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> chunk<00:02:59.130> at<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
kind of you know take a chunk at the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.730 
kind of you know take a chunk at the
bottom<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.540> clip<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.170> with<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.620> know

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
bottom and I clip it up with you know

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.410 
bottom and I clip it up with you know
tall<00:03:02.190> clip<00:03:02.460> or<00:03:02.930> whatever<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.120> use<00:03:06.270> my

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
tall clip or whatever and I use my

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.380 
tall clip or whatever and I use my
Aussie<00:03:06.930> instant<00:03:07.470> freeze<00:03:07.830> sculpting<00:03:08.790> gel<00:03:08.820> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
Aussie instant freeze sculpting gel and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.630 
Aussie instant freeze sculpting gel and
it<00:03:09.960> has<00:03:10.110> three<00:03:10.500> circles<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.070> are<00:03:11.220> colored<00:03:11.520> in

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
it has three circles that are colored in

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.060 
it has three circles that are colored in
out<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.940> four<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.560> three

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
out of four so it's like you know three

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.800 
out of four so it's like you know three
fourths<00:03:14.550> maximum<00:03:15.090> hold<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.510> guess<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:17.690> put<00:03:18.690> this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
fourths maximum hold I guess I put this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.860 
fourths maximum hold I guess I put this
in<00:03:18.990> my<00:03:19.110> hair<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:20.220> press<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.730> down<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.300> my

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
in my hair and I press it down on my

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
in my hair and I press it down on my
roots<00:03:22.170> as<00:03:22.380> well<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.100> gives<00:03:23.580> my<00:03:23.730> hair<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
roots as well and this gives my hair a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.420 
roots as well and this gives my hair a
little<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.330> more<00:03:24.390> flatness<00:03:25.100> so<00:03:26.100> my<00:03:26.220> hair<00:03:26.370> is

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
little bit more flatness so my hair is

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.670 
little bit more flatness so my hair is
not<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:27.030> volumize<00:03:27.720> because<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:28.140> got<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> water

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
not as volumize because I got a water

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.190 
not as volumize because I got a water
hair

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.630 

I<00:03:36.260> take<00:03:36.920> down<00:03:37.099> another<00:03:37.280> section<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.430> just

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
I take down another section and I just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.809 
I take down another section and I just
clip<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> rest<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.569> get<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.780> out<00:03:41.870> away<00:03:42.110> and

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
clip up the rest to get it out away and

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.550 
clip up the rest to get it out away and
my<00:03:43.819> hair<00:03:43.970> starting<00:03:44.300> already<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.870> get<00:03:45.019> dry<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.530> I

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
my hair starting already to get dry so I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.869 
my hair starting already to get dry so I
just<00:03:45.890> spritz<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.400> little<00:03:46.610> bit<00:03:46.700> with<00:03:46.849> some

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
just spritz it a little bit with some

00:03:46.879 --> 00:04:04.250 
just spritz it a little bit with some
water

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.160 

and<00:04:05.330> then<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.569> apply<00:04:07.050> my<00:04:07.290> gel<00:04:08.870> evenly<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.019> the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and then I apply my gel evenly on the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.080 
and then I apply my gel evenly on the
section<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.769> just<00:04:11.099> took<00:04:12.060> down<00:04:16.760> now<00:04:17.760> this

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
section that I just took down now this

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.699 
section that I just took down now this
is<00:04:18.239> where<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.479> starts<00:04:18.780> getting<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:19.260> little<00:04:19.500> bit

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
is where it starts getting a little bit

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.900 
is where it starts getting a little bit
more<00:04:19.919> difficult<00:04:20.519> it's<00:04:21.090> not<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.449> hard<00:04:21.600> though

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:38.690 

spits<00:04:26.910> me<00:04:27.030> here<00:04:27.180> are<00:04:27.240> some<00:04:27.389> water

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.960 

and<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:39.480> focus<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.080> gel<00:04:40.380> only<00:04:40.770> on<00:04:40.920> one<00:04:41.460> small

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
and I focus the gel only on one small

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.620 
and I focus the gel only on one small
section<00:04:42.300> probably<00:04:42.870> about<00:04:42.990> two<00:04:43.260> inches<00:04:43.740> wide

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
section probably about two inches wide

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.110 
section probably about two inches wide
and<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.990> split<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.470> into<00:04:46.950> two<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.580> then<00:04:47.970> the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
and I split that into two and then the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.390 
and I split that into two and then the
smaller<00:04:48.420> section<00:04:48.930> that<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.140> got<00:04:49.440> I<00:04:49.710> split<00:04:50.190> that

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
smaller section that I got I split that

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.420 
smaller section that I got I split that
into<00:04:50.730> two<00:04:50.970> as<00:04:51.450> well<00:04:51.720> so<00:04:52.350> pretty<00:04:52.830> much<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> split

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
into two as well so pretty much a split

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.190 
into two as well so pretty much a split
I<00:04:53.750> know<00:04:54.750> split<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.670> split<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:57.390> two-inch

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
I know split I split the two-inch

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.520 
I know split I split the two-inch
section<00:04:58.740> into<00:04:59.580> a<00:05:01.520> 1/4<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:03.120> 1/4<00:05:03.900> in<00:05:04.080> sections

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
section into a 1/4 to 1/4 in sections

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.560 
section into a 1/4 to 1/4 in sections
that<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:04.770> even<00:05:04.980> makes<00:05:05.130> sense<00:05:05.270> but<00:05:06.270> what<00:05:06.330> I'm

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
that that even makes sense but what I'm

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.500 
that that even makes sense but what I'm
doing<00:05:06.600> is<00:05:07.020> I'm<00:05:07.230> just<00:05:07.700> twisting<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.730> hair<00:05:09.240> on

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
doing is I'm just twisting the hair on

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.630 
doing is I'm just twisting the hair on
top<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.200> one<00:05:10.380> another<00:05:10.410> over<00:05:10.950> each<00:05:11.190> other<00:05:11.400> as

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
top of one another over each other as

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.820 
top of one another over each other as
and<00:05:11.790> you<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.030> twisting<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.630> hair<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:12.990> this

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
and you know twisting the hair and this

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.320 
and you know twisting the hair and this
is<00:05:14.010> called<00:05:14.220> two<00:05:14.430> strand<00:05:14.730> twist<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.210> it's

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
is called two strand twist and it's

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.790 
is called two strand twist and it's
pretty<00:05:15.510> cool<00:05:15.720> because<00:05:15.870> curly<00:05:16.410> hair<00:05:16.590> can<00:05:16.770> be

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
pretty cool because curly hair can be

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.360 
pretty cool because curly hair can be
manipulated<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.560> what<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.680> does<00:05:19.920> is<00:05:20.190> it's

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
manipulated and what this does is it's

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.220 
manipulated and what this does is it's
causing<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.820> curls<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.180> be<00:05:21.360> forced<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.960> clump

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
causing the curls to be forced to clump

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.480 
causing the curls to be forced to clump
together<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:24.560> it's<00:05:25.560> causing<00:05:25.890> them<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.190> create

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
together and it's causing them to create

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.120 
together and it's causing them to create
these<00:05:27.150> really<00:05:27.660> pretty<00:05:27.900> defined<00:05:28.530> curls

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
these really pretty defined curls

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.850 
these really pretty defined curls
instead<00:05:29.700> of<00:05:29.880> like<00:05:30.570> in<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.930> back<00:05:31.170> how<00:05:31.560> each

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
instead of like in the back how each

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.030 
instead of like in the back how each
curl<00:05:32.310> almost<00:05:32.700> looks<00:05:33.000> individual<00:05:33.750> these<00:05:34.590> curls

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
curl almost looks individual these curls

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.980 
curl almost looks individual these curls
are<00:05:35.280> causing<00:05:35.730> them<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:36.060> be<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.600> know<00:05:36.720> clump

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
are causing them to be you know clump

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.230 
are causing them to be you know clump
together<00:05:37.140> and<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.580> top<00:05:38.790> of<00:05:38.820> there<00:05:39.120> it

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
together and so the top of there it

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.060 
together and so the top of there it
looks<00:05:39.390> kind<00:05:39.660> of<00:05:39.750> bushy<00:05:40.230> kind<00:05:40.440> of<00:05:40.500> puffy<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.010> I

because um it's like your hair dries
faster<00:06:43.710> and<00:06:44.100> you<00:06:44.880> don't<00:06:45.060> have<00:06:45.330> to<00:06:45.479> really

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
faster and you don't have to really

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:53.890 
faster and you don't have to really
touch<00:06:45.900> your<00:06:46.080> hair<00:06:46.229> so<00:06:46.500> it<00:06:46.530> doesn't<00:06:46.650> get<00:06:46.919> frizzy

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.270 

you<00:06:54.900> just<00:06:55.080> have<00:06:55.200> to<00:06:55.320> really<00:06:55.530> be<00:06:55.740> careful<00:06:56.190> when

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
you just have to really be careful when

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.410 
you just have to really be careful when
you're<00:06:56.370> doing<00:06:56.430> this<00:06:56.670> because<00:06:56.790> you<00:06:57.000> don't<00:06:57.120> want

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
you're doing this because you don't want

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.910 
you're doing this because you don't want
to<00:06:57.510> create<00:06:57.720> frizz<00:06:58.020> by<00:06:58.230> touching<00:06:58.500> your<00:06:58.770> hair

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
to create frizz by touching your hair

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.890 
to create frizz by touching your hair
too<00:06:59.100> much<00:06:59.330> and<00:07:01.460> this<00:07:02.460> is<00:07:02.640> the<00:07:02.850> fun<00:07:03.060> part<00:07:03.090> okay

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
too much and this is the fun part okay

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.140 
too much and this is the fun part okay
so<00:07:04.230> now<00:07:04.590> you<00:07:04.650> take<00:07:04.980> apart<00:07:05.340> the<00:07:05.580> two<00:07:05.790> strand

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
so now you take apart the two strand

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.870 
so now you take apart the two strand
twists<00:07:06.980> and<00:07:07.980> it's<00:07:08.130> really<00:07:08.400> cool<00:07:08.580> because<00:07:08.730> you

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 
twists and it's really cool because you
