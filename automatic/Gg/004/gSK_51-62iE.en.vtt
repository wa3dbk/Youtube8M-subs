00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.159
 Hello 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.749
 This project introduced Kiseleva I Taras 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:12.729
 oleynik 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.519
 and this but the steamer rondo will be 22 25 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.169
 production company Algeria 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.130
 electronica 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.039
 his main feature 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.189
 High precision LCD 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.859
 panels 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.289
 built by ips technology 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.149
 m 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.729
 why is it important to know for what 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.859
 technology produced lcd 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.460
 because it directly affects 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.320
 image quality 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 the vast majority are cheap 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.910
 The monitor is available in tn mattresses for 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.170
 filming who have a number of born 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.330
 deficiencies 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.110
 there is no accurate color reproduction 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.870
 distortion arising from 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.600
 looking at the display thought 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.240
 all this lack display 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.080
 We had not been equipped before 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.530
 only dear professionally 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.740
 devices 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.240
 now with the advent of the panel 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.740
 having the advantage of such monitors cheaper and 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.440
 become quite accessible to the mass market 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.020
 m 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.579
 trond magic over 22 23 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.400
 looks modest and neat 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.820
 his design is a tribute to simplicity 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.130
 of efficiency 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.210
 Gray matte plastic case is not at all 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.030
 glare 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.540
 stand allows wide limits 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.479
 adjust the height of the slope and cooks 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.520
 panels as well as install it in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.240
 portrait mode 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 control keys crane mining censor may and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.270
 in the dark they don't highlight 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 connect to computer display 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.170
 can through vga interfaces bright 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.280
 the president 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.220
 m 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.080
 payment is provided 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.950
 quick mode selection system 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.120
 mappings 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.920
 also besides typical brightness adjustments 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.790
 contrast and color temperature 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.910
 opportunity present 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.540
 adjust gamma 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.300
 but also fine tune 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.270
 colors are six colors 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.120
 axes 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.620
 controlling for each color its tint and 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.290
 saturation 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.180
 m 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.810
 to find out how much quality 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.040
 shows the monitor 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.690
 take advantage of the hardware says 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.490
 routine 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.479
 special software 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 calibration software 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.450
 dysplasia test results do not give 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.919
 motives dynamics 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.219
 color rendition correctly 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.289
 maximum brightness and contrast also 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:15.879
 quite enough 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.930
 About this display can only be that inflated 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.159
 minimum brightness that will affect when 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.059
 use in the dark 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.139
 as well as a small error 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.679
 elaboration of parts in semitones 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.309
 matrix response time is good 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.679
 the pace 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.049
 m 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.870
 surely this action will not be able 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.150
 compete with expensive 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.459
 professional model 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.629
 there is a buyer for it 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.769
 Misha Mass in history on quality 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.339
 hockey in panama is almost empty 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.149
 it means the fifth does not argue 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:48.689
 photographers and designers will be happy 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.079
 all users who need 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.509
 image quality 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.319
 Well, that when transferring excellent
