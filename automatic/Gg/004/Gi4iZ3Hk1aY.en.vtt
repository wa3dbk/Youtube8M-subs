00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello again boys and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.469
 welcome to nothing because in this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.500
 If we find ourselves, I just have to give you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.699
 of fairly important information 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.600
 hello bizkit hello hello 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 so up until this moment I have had 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.340
 a private teamspeak server where only 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.560
 few have access 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.109
 but now forwards because I am 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 selfish are a lot of shit and you're ad 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.070
 to be ahead as it came anyway 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.040
 practically left unused 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.989
 because very few people had 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.390
 very few people had access to it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 and I only use it to make videos in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.329
 a private room 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.149
 I decided to make it public and to do yes 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.180
 that anyone anyone wants to find a 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.070
 group where to play in company with the others 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 games we like best can 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.660
 enter without password 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.129
 special commitments and then play 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.780
 inside this server test what 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.129
 you will find you will find in the rooms 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 public precisely for the games there 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.150
 like the most you'll also find though 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.740
 private rooms in case you 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 already have a clan group 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.659
 you can enter on our psv will be given 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.130
 a room to play with your friends 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.720
 obviously I prefer you to play 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.259
 a little all together, however, it's fine too 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.270
 so we will also organize meetings 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.650
 where also I will obviously participate and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 we will play on a game chosen at the time 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.540
 which can be minecraft daisy rast 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.009
 what happens to us and we have fun 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.780
 all together we can do it too 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 important things because you succeed 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.799
 to be in 5 10 in short you can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
 do a lot then we'll do some meetings 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 where you can give me advice yes 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 will chat together on the videos you have 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.079
 would like to see things on the channel 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.939
 in short, we could also meet 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.210
 in this sense I still play when I play 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.820
 when I register he sometimes looked for people 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.920
 to make extras of the parts in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.110
 video and of course if you found some 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.979
 people connected on ts with a good one 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.969
 microphone and good headphones too 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.590
 I could ask them come 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.039
 part you want to do it so if anyone 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.599
 of you also interests this is a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.060
 reason to enter you too 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.450
 speak 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.709
 what to say I think it's all here 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 I don't want to say too much 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.760
 bizkit will also always be present 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.260
 on the ts server so if any of you 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.630
 has any particular request or 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.569
 problem can ask me or if there 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 I am also admitted to bizkit end 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:37.480
 and no lajos the fuck what else to tell you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.430
 I will leave all the descriptions in description 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.080
 information needed to connect 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.330
 on teamspeak servers and also for 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.769
 download it set it in case 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.140
 some of you weren't practical 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.880
 however it is very simple indeed 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.239
 just press two buttons in 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.950
 cross I will leave you the link of the high 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
 download of course you have to choose 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.880
 the version for your system 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.310
 operating so if you have the windows 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.860
 windows version if you have a windows 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.380
 64-bit 64-bit version for 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.030
 example windows seven 64 bit and click 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.030
 on windows 64 bit 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.060
 there is more to say, I guess not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.709
 so lion to the ts server we don't have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 lost the thing that brought me good I would have 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.560
 written in description in each case ets 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.390
 punto wen gamers and the point it is this 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.060
