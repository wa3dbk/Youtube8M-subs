 the hospital 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.489
 the ahmad broker 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.639
 sergi santacana in looking at the random numbers 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.159
 pedrosa are repeated 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.159
 and they keep saving to have an arrangement 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.570
 the only condition to be the same again 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.589
 ares and the random number has not been used up before 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 at the end of it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 likewise all the numbers in the arrangement 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.520
 efe that proceed to distribute the images 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340
 on each button 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 corresponding to the random number 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.790
 nick bucci is the power this aqueduct and tries to find the solution to 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.880
 rearrange the miners in Moscow 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.870
 I heard that column 1 irak turner got about 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 two 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.860
 in column 2 hidalgo 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.800
 of the 4 85 min 6 e the columns three strips 2007 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.840
 all times is more than a year 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.910
 bisbal start the game 2 - the random order appears and are the numbers of the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.500
 world through the web you overflow more base levels a plan meets 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.950
 it is visualized that it marginalized him and three mortals I explain myself 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.320
 h this game 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.340
 the mobile video game 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.090
 the notes of the google mobile version the left empty space 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.110
 the prosecutor upwards came down 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 depending on where Chavez is expected in his research the plan 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.820
 h the main objective is to simply put the numbers back to the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.230
 fossil movement and in the mec the shortest time 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.079
 possibility that is predictable we have to find the shortest way what 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.079
 fastest possible 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.929
 once they won the game the process of generating numbers is repeated 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.179
 random 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:25.289

 vitale who researched with file 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.729
 thereafter 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.759
 let's do it again or rebuild

 in huelva 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.989
 very numerous and actors
