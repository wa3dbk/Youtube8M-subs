00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.570
 Y 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.860
 is that you transact how you will be because 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.210
 is very good today here browich 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.290
 Welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.940
 in which I will show you how 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.439
 get the 9 but before you start 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.270
 gentlemen I do not want you to think that in this 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.340
 gameplay are going to see the 9 pérez in action 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.660
 because real I did not do much to do it 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.630
 I was just playing I wanted to take out 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.240
 some some things for the videos and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.530
 I did not spend the 99 pesos but 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880
 there are enough gameplays on youtube I think 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.960
 that poker has one I think that play the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.340
 game has another in case who see a 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.290
 gameplay with the new excuse and they have it 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.910
 things is how to get 29 shares 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.530
 persists from know what good maximum 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.489
 we can get 5 pers counting 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.710
 we can get the four that 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.780
 we want and also the free tav 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.820
 that we get to activate I say but sorry 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.470
 for spending 30,000 points then how 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.479
 we can get the 9 is a way 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.489
 rather complicated rather said is very 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.809
 you need good luck and it's because of 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.670
 what I did not want to do in this video 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.930
 but what needs to be taught is the shovel 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.430
 gold the euro shovel and is that still 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.629
 no tutorial so I'm going to upload some 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.040
 minutes later this video I'm going to 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.330
 leave in the description these good 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.379
 Gentlemen once they have the shovel 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.549
 gold then there will be in your inventory 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.990
 what they have to do is get 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.670
 zombie blood and once you have 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.619
 zombie blood have to look 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.260
 around the whole map not in 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.540
 common locations what would they be in 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.300
 pieces of land where to dig because 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.100
 about three speak that these are always 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.590
 these little piles of tea where can 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.360
 dig normally you appear 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.010
 have zombie blood or not but these 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.570
 specials are going to be a bunch of 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.590
 special land that will only be with 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.630
 the blood is me but they are going to be 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.070
 different locations something that I'm going to 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.690
 that does not matter if there is no 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.910
 heap of land in what would be all the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 map this pile will still seem like this 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.140
 it was going to be a location a little bit 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.670
 special for which you must extend 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.290
 a little more your search limits 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.820
 then have them in blood are my 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.740
 bullets you're going to see what this heap would be 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 this red master amount and like that with 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.090
 golden bones is going to be shining 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.040
 Well, it's going to be very easy to see 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.020
 special pile and once every time 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.090
 in it you will see what will appear 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.260
 it would be a bottle an empty bottle and 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.970
 when I grab it, there's going to be no 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.550
 change however the change that this 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.590
 generated is that you will have a slot plus a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.990
 more space for which for any 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.480
 why do you want for example 7 hours 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.619
 4 pers and good no matter how many you have 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.119
 actually but you already know that you 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.410
 normally they have four spaces for 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.360
 Perez then you have four 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.950
 do one of these and now they have five 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.510
 and now it does not matter how many times they die 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.190
 in the game obviously if the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.990
 This no longer works starting gate 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.910
 every time they die in the game they're going 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.370
 to have room for 5 pérex the persie 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.080
 your 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.370
 and it's a matter of repeating this same 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.599
 process sir is simply that you 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.489
 come out a zombie blood and go to 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.409
 look for what would be this bunch of 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.790
 bright earth and they will be 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.040
 getting it to be in these spaces 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.900
 of the hairs and eventually they go 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.069
 to have room for the 9 pérez what 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.780
 I recommend you gentlemen is that for not 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.599
 do this so long and without having the 9 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.579
 but nothing else get in four of 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.989
 these four bottles will have four 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.700
 countries and that no good forgiveness are going to 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.019
 have eight pérez and that none of them 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.640
 be an adult because they know that 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.959
 adult they give it to you for free and also what 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.730
 you can add no matter how many 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.470
 spaces you have in the pérez then 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.599
 you are in phase gentlemen for the gold 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.069
 zombie blood and motorcycles and ground cough 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.750
 specials around the map are going to 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.459
 give a new space for any 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.780
 because you want and then nothing gentlemen 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.280
 that will be all I hope you like this 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.209
 video costs a lot see you later 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.209
 goodbye
