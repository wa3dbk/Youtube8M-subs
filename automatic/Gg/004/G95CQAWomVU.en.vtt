00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.720
 - Hey, hot Remy! How are you? - Hello there. 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.360
 - Hey, Cedric! - How are you? 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.000
 - You seem to be very familiar. - We are very familiar! 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.960
 Our biggest difference is that in my parents' room, I still have his poster in the room I have lived in. 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.640
 That's it! 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.600
 He won't post my poster! 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.640
 Where are you going? 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800
 - Go to Roland Garros to practice the ball. - Row! 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.600
 - We used to play together. Do you remember? - Remember. 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.360
 I still remember Cedric Piolin's caddy! 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240
 - No way! - This is real! 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.760
 It was the Davis Cup in Pau. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.320
 I remember practicing the ball once, he beat all the balls out of bounds. 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.160
 Also broke the racket. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 The caddy at the side felt his nervousness, and we were particularly worried when we croquet! 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.400
 I propose that you play a mini French net. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.800
 Mini French Network? 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.400
 - I am not wearing red clay tennis shoes. - I am wearing lawn tennis shoes! 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.880
 It turned out to be this! 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600
 Don't have to warm up, let's get started! 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 1 to 0. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.600
 - 1 to 1. - Deciding the disc. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800
 Ready? 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 Come on, hot Remy! you can do it! 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.320
 - I won! - Congratulations! 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.400
 Talking about victory, if you win 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.320
 French Open Championship trophy, where are you going? 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.400
 I have to play a mini French net with Cedric again! 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 The Roland Garros stadium is here. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.200
 Before you get off the bus, let's take a selfie together. Ready? 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.640
 - Snap it! - Take it!
