danced<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.030> face<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.930> what's<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.189> one

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
danced to face and what's up in this one

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840 
danced to face and what's up in this one
it's<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.020> few<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.610> tweets<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's just like a few of tweets in the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's just like a few of tweets in the
main<00:01:15.090> reason<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> many

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
main reason I use this was not that many

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.149 
main reason I use this was not that many
packages<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.060> us<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.479> V<00:01:19.170> wallpaper<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
packages up on us just V wallpaper and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
packages up on us just V wallpaper and
screw<00:01:20.340> coming<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
screw coming and I think this is the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
screw coming and I think this is the
only<00:01:22.680> source<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.340> has<00:01:23.520> v<00:01:23.880> wallpaper<00:01:24.450> right

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
only source that has v wallpaper right

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.350 
only source that has v wallpaper right
now<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.290> free<00:01:25.470> other<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
now for free other than that you have to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.649 
now for free other than that you have to
pay<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> most<00:01:29.880> people<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
pay for it and so most people use this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
pay for it and so most people use this
just<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.200> package<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> that's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
just for that one package and that's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480 
just for that one package and that's
what<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.280> want
