00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello to everything today I you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.940
 offers a video on water marc 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
 which I chose to do in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.800
 french manicure to change a little 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:17.010
 little and I also add a decor in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.180
 3d resin a little flower so for them 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.789
 fingers where there will be the french manicure 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 I put down my basic beige polish and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.500
 on the ring finger thumb I laid the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.869
 white polish then we go so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.109
 apply a french manicure stickers 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.090
 to do the rounding so I glued them 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.649
 three times on my hand and then on 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.210
 my nail so that it does not stick 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.530
 not too much that it does not tear off my nail polish 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.480
 because what I had been very 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.430
 sticky so it's a pity I had not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.219
 too many choice of stickers I had that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.520
 so the smile of my fresh manicure 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.649
 is not so very very rounded 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.129
 then I put a tape below and 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.870
 a scotch scan on it then i'm going 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.030
 apply my white polish to do the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 base of morning embl on others must 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.260
 so I put the tape below I 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.059
 took masking tape because I like 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.430
 well the texture it sticks less than 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.470
 plastic tape then so I 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.510
 taken these four varnishes so these are 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 varnish not very very expensive because 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.790
 I avoid using extremely polish 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.979
 dear for water marc beuls and so I 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 put the drops of varnishes men 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 in others in each other 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 to make my adorable 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.479
 if you want more information for 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.799
 succeed and tips to get to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 do this beautiful ouattara I you 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.470
 advise to go see the video that I have 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.119
 put in annotations so there I spread 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 my humble water and as it remains of the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.140
 place I add a few drops then 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.659
 then when it spreads more I take 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 a little spades so a cure tooth or there 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.490
 I took a pic in doing and I'm going 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 draw lines to create 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.409
 bridges so I'm not bridging too much 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 spaced otherwise there will not be any 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.270
 a lot on the nail and then I'm going 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.180
 soaked nail on the pattern that I like 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 I blow on the water and then I withdraw the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.350
 ouattara bowl with a stick 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.100
 then I turn the nail and so with 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.950
 my tweezers why dirty me 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.020
 loth the other nails I remove my 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.819
 tape so if you have placed the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.440
 scotchs you have very little left 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.060
 cleaning to do that's why 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.500
 besides that I much prefer the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.600
 method with the scotches rather than this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.130
 that we can see with the girls who 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.350
 put some wood glue or stuff 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.630
 made bold it is useless I find 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.340
 that it takes a step in addition to asking 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.780
 the product since in all cases 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.950
 for if you really want some 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.900
 perfect thing it will still be necessary 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.360
 cleaned up at the end so I do not see too much 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.890
 the interest actually 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.420
 then I have limits and my engine 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 beautiful with a small stroke of paint 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 you can do with a varnished liner 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.950
 for example it's just for it to be 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.569
 sharper 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.700
 then I will have fun doing 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.560
 a little resin flower so I 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.519
 took my 3d brush you have of course 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.150
 all the references in the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.300
 description 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.330
 I put a small ball of resin then 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.690
 I will flatten it so with the body of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.610
 my brush I flatten mag august for 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.959
 to make petals if you want more 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.090
 info about the resin 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.610
 so I put you the video in swimming 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.569
 for those who do not know her who 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.569
 want to know a little more 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.330
 and then I just have to apply 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.310
 a rhinestone I forgot to tell you that 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.810
 I had posed before the reason 3d I had 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.730
 laid the top coat and I made 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.630
 directly the 3d resin from above 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.760
 since there is no need for 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.590
 cover up and that's the result 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.470
 I hope you like it 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.580
 will reconcile with the neighbor marble me 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.980
 I give you an appointment Friday 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.420
 next for a new video and if 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.290
 you have ideas do not hesitate to me 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.980
