00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 for the next set of loops we have with 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.899
 you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.139
 poker levers on the carriage must be 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.290
 raised to the usual position ie we 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 just raise them you see brushes 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.660
 changed their position 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.960
 and we will begin to set the edge 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 circle around this loop set we are with you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.490
 exhibit in front of non-working 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.590
 the position is the same 40 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.680
 needles we prepare a detaching comb on 100 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:44.030
 needles thread I already rule in a thread guide 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.840
 carriages and begin to twist the loop 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.690
 we start a thread tip in my hands 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.289
 we start a thread between the first and second 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.920
 needle and twisting counterclockwise 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.920
 not tight 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.260
 there every needle 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.890
 this process is basically enough 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:24.610
 simple but you need what is called to drink 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:35.680
 on this hand was not to entanglement 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:37.000
 too tight or too weak here 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.390
 so we circled 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 all the loops now draw your 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.220
 focus on the carriage I put the density 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.009
 A large enough nine can be if 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.460
 not . thicker and more density 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.800
 put the needle separate 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.610
 leverage or in other words leverage 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.590
 partial knitting are on figure 2 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:12.370
 I recall the needles in position d 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:15.120
 knit and carry out carriages with us once 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.630
 with you turned in 1 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:30.299
 typesetting what we do next we 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:32.370
 slightly push the needles forward so here 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.900
 it's clear that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.400
 the thread we reached because 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.140
 the thread guide is set up enough hay we 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.280
 fix 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.470
 thread in nete water so as not to diminish 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.620
 yarn these loops I just knit 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.620
 manually 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.670
 This is how long it turned out 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.849
 loops and now i keep that what 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.970
 the beginning 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:22.250
 push forward loop we went out 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.800
 as if forward and we have distance 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.980
 between eyelets 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.830
 and needle cases in this distance and me and 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.250
 looking for some 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.250
 trimming comb 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:57.940
 I insert pizza and go over and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:02.060
 down I see this comb on fun 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:08.630
 now we will knit a few more rows 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:11.780
 you can hang the chest while hanging 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.890
 small weight to pull the comb than 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.890
 good this way 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.390
 releasing the thread and clamping and putting 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.010
 estimated density here on the seven 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.010
 put 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.260
 what good is this way so that we have 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.260
 you have 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.120
 uniform delay first row we 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.400
 knit 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.729
 neat because comb here 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.960
 the car is slightly in the way, and then everything 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.960
 like clockwork 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.970
 especially the presence of uniform backstay 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.710
 important for knitting patterns like press 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.930
 so and openwork because the loops are all 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:12.330
 all the same are in the same 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:16.070
 position and so this was the edge closed 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.070
 loops entanglement
