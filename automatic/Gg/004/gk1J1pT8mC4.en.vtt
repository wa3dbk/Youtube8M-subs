00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:25.329
 you are an example of a substance on its 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.329
 two doors that open the middle 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.900
 well as one side 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.320
 around and then the other side sits one 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.860
 stopper needle 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.860
 this storm needle that always sits on the right 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.670
 here it is 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.670
 bell jar and it goes on like that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.640
 if this goes on 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.230
 whether it is about windows or doors 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.090
 the same 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.780
 this is what you say on the right 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.200
 that of 12 to 12 make another side 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:17.929
 around here and then you can get that out of the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:19.609
 hand but you can also fear and then 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.359
 You should always make a little pass that 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.359
 glides nicely 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.090
 and then you can the espagnolet closure can 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.030
 make you needles but you can do it too 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.330
 put it next and he whose money needed 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.840
 to put that on and then you can 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.140
 this so down in an egg in one 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 picture or an uprising 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.490
 can screw up your box on chance 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.179
 you have flat pictures that you put in 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.970
 chops but this is his and on 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:03.319
 you can do with walking over it 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.909
 help you broken but I will see 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.649
 that this is not the case in two and three and 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.019
 then above him I also find a hole with 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.410
 an image where those in the top or 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:21.290
 just in between pulse so-called calf 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:24.200
 No one here can even be later than 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.870
 I made two windows here and then 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.600
 should also be bell windows so I have 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.540
 made such an evening to length here 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.549
 then comes as a judge to this 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.040
 king on the outside but I am mistaken 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:42.230
 still want to see me so pay attention 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.450
 and then you start screwing up and then 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.609
 and that I had to tailor it a bit 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.040
 I saw a slightly broad case that 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.140
 saleswoman of 4 centimeters who 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.160
 tension this window is also 4 centimeters 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.299
 so that works out well but if I do 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.019
 a window and of 3.6 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.870
 inches then I saw him once that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.790
 lace it off and glue it on one 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.650
 I have exactly the thickness of the saw 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.650
 I met down there making these again 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.799
 fits the 3.6 window 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.889
 so then that round doesn't quite come 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.290
 neat again but you can with that 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.310
 rounding that comes to adjust this 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 goes well ago 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.530
 I also spent vigilance and that 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:45.710
 now this goes to here fron fresen 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:45.710
 so that should be free with me 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.560
 k a curve on both sides 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.560
 to fear 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.269
 here 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.190
 I did not fear all the way through 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.010
 the end because you then shoot at you 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.440
 machine and then get point here and this 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.789
 I just sheep by hand 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:15.440
 and this is still of the broad 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.270
 Here you can do that should be round 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.860
 so then I go with so they gave us so 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.620
 then this works 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.160
 prince piece it's a waste piece of it 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:29.440
 he sawed off the many years of thesis 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.440
 should have led 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:20.250
 and still feels a bit stiff but like me 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:25.000
 this is going to paint and paint it very smooth 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:28.810
 then two believe surface each other 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.310
 right under her so now the wood is up 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:35.520
 wood and that is not ground him 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:39.390
 but can the sheep wind you through 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.390
 we did we go for it
