00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
Shane McMahon my only problem is the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.860

anything<00:05:22.199> from<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.860> current<00:05:23.280> era<00:05:24.080> because<00:05:25.080> it

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
anything from the current era because it

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.360 
anything from the current era because it
really<00:05:25.409> burned<00:05:25.590> down<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.919> only<00:05:26.069> good<00:05:26.190> match

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
really burned down the only good match

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.540 
really burned down the only good match
from<00:05:26.909> was<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.750> street<00:05:28.349> fight<00:05:28.620> between<00:05:28.650> Shawn

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550

and<00:05:29.990> Shane<00:05:30.990> McMahon<00:05:31.409> and<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:32.130> really<00:05:32.430> wasn't

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
and Shane McMahon and that really wasn't

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.180 
and Shane McMahon and that really wasn't
that<00:05:32.759> great<00:05:32.940> anyway<00:05:33.029> it<00:05:33.509> was<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:34.500> wasn't<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.979> big

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
that great anyway it was it wasn't a big

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.309 
that great anyway it was it wasn't a big
moment<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.729> something<00:05:36.690> like<00:05:36.840> main<00:05:37.020> events

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
moment in something like main events

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.350 
moment in something like main events
history<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.680> mean<00:05:37.889> it<00:05:38.370> Saturday<00:05:38.969> night's<00:05:39.150> main

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
history I mean it Saturday night's main

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.540 
history I mean it Saturday night's main
event<00:05:39.419> only<00:05:40.020> lasted<00:05:40.529> seven<00:05:41.039> years<00:05:41.279> I<00:05:41.490> think

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
event only lasted seven years I think

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.659 
event only lasted seven years I think
maybe<00:05:42.270> I<00:05:42.389> years<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.590> they<00:05:44.069> did<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.340> great<00:05:44.550> job

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
maybe I years and they did a great job

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.610 
maybe I years and they did a great job
spanning<00:05:45.599> I<00:05:45.659> think<00:05:45.900> they<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.080> put<00:05:46.500> those

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
spanning I think they just put those

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.379 
spanning I think they just put those
extra<00:05:46.770> a<00:05:46.949> couple<00:05:47.190> things<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.669> say<00:05:47.849> yes<00:05:48.180> we

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
extra a couple things in to say yes we

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.469 
extra a couple things in to say yes we
redid<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.729> here's<00:05:50.729> three<00:05:51.210> matches<00:05:51.599> from<00:05:51.750> it

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
redid it here's three matches from it

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.749 
redid it here's three matches from it
but<00:05:54.479> it<00:05:55.020> may<00:05:55.469> have<00:05:55.590> even<00:05:55.680> been<00:05:55.979> disc<00:05:56.310> filling

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
but it may have even been disc filling

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.959 
but it may have even been disc filling
because<00:05:57.539> the<00:05:57.900> G<00:05:58.500> Generation<00:05:59.219> X<00:05:59.400> Spirit<00:05:59.879> Squad

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
because the G Generation X Spirit Squad

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.019 
because the G Generation X Spirit Squad
match<00:06:00.270> was<00:06:00.479> horrid<00:06:01.370> one<00:06:02.370> start<00:06:02.729> on<00:06:02.849> that<00:06:02.969> one

and<00:06:26.250> I've<00:06:26.819> read<00:06:26.969> around<00:06:27.120> most<00:06:27.389> people<00:06:27.719> have

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
and I've read around most people have

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.999 
and I've read around most people have
and<00:06:28.699> it<00:06:29.699> really<00:06:30.060> did<00:06:30.240> show<00:06:30.509> that<00:06:30.840> from<00:06:31.710> what<00:06:31.979> I

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
and it really did show that from what I

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.310 
and it really did show that from what I
have<00:06:32.310> read<00:06:32.639> that<00:06:33.060> it<00:06:33.300> really<00:06:33.629> did<00:06:33.839> show<00:06:34.080> the

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
have read that it really did show the

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.270 
have read that it really did show the
best<00:06:34.500> part<00:06:34.800> of<00:06:35.039> the<00:06:35.759> Senate

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
best part of the Senate

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.340 
best part of the Senate
main<00:06:36.430> event<00:06:36.610> and<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.720> reason<00:06:37.960> why<00:06:38.050> it<00:06:38.110> really

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
main event and the reason why it really

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.650 
main event and the reason why it really
loses<00:06:38.500> that<00:06:38.800> one<00:06:38.980> mark<00:06:39.220> is<00:06:39.490> because<00:06:40.030> the

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
loses that one mark is because the

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.300 
loses that one mark is because the
masters<00:06:40.990> went<00:06:41.139> up<00:06:41.350> to<00:06:41.500> weren't<00:06:41.980> really<00:06:42.190> that

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
masters went up to weren't really that

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.240 
masters went up to weren't really that
