00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.179
 hail hail hail beauty how much in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 area making another video for you and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.570
 in today's video I'll talk about it 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.060
 here something that some enrolled me 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.770
 they ask and maybe there was 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.449
 some other people too 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 so I decided to give a class tip 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.570
 to play the assault is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 understanding that this is only a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.890
 suggestion based on a lot in taste 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320
 It does not mean that it's better to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 class or who can not make some 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.239
 changes in it but usually it is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.059
 today I have achieved good results 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.129
 I have been very pleased with the people. 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 speak of the class itself 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.180
 it should also be remembered that the annexes 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.309
 that you will choose your weapon depends on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 much of the weapon itself that you will use 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 and it is precisely at this point that the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.039
 I mentioned that there may be 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.320
 variations from one hour to another one 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.719
 example is that those themes that have 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.239
 as larger than the other 11 ones 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 recharge faster others are giving 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.449
 bigger and so on 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.939
 this will directly influence the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.070
 choice of attachments and in some ways 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 influencing their gameplay as well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 one more detail that we can not 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 to say is that the class that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 People are going to ride depends on what I 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 I already talked about the game mode that you are going to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 choose to play and this weighs in the hour 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.939
 you choose both sanex and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 advantages okay then I said all this 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.530
 I will use as an example two game modes 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 but on the basis of these modes we can 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.200
 adapt class to other modalities 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.030
 well okay I'll use as assault and 94 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.950
 which is excellent by the way many of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.350
 you should use it but for those who do not use it 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.490
 She's more than recommended, okay? 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.130
 so the first thing that people 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.500
 you need to know what kind of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.090
 game this class will be used me as 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 I have already mentioned data that are 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 dominion as I start with the name 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.659
 nation is once we know which 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.409
 the way we are going to use this 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.939
 class 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.680
 we will define the public cuts that the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.390
 people will use and now you must be 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 wondering apple but have to see 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 the cuts with the class 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.210
 and I respond it's all about whether you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 want to pick the highest cuts you 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.379
 you need to stay somewhat less 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.970
 perceptible on the map connected in a way 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.270
 which draws less attention 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.430
 already if you choose 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 articles smaller the fact that you appear 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.240
 on the map may even be good because 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.650
 enemies are going to go after you 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.420
 turned on that court player when he sees a 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.460
 bridge on the map goes back right 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.170
 if you can kill they will 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.570
 get your cars just by asking 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.340
 so come on you then I 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.490
 I have currently used the Sentinel 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.750
 the war machine and the helicopter is the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.640
 commander hamilton 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.220
 that's the way we go to class 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.530
 properly as the first annex 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.080
 I would choose the quick balcony or door 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.210
 I still prefer quick swing ammunition 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.650
 because I'm very flustered the player 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.020
 hardly plays defensively 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.760
 so if you can turn 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.320
 a little faster enemy 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.470
 Today I feel more confident to run. 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.240
 the whole map and as per the annex and for 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.950
 salt I think it becomes kind of 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.900
 compulsory even to have more agility 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.670
 when you have s 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.280
 is the stock that have the same function 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.140
 basically from the stal Canada mw3 while 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.240
 it's watching you can move the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.850
 the character's mother more quickly 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.560
 I would only put these two but nothing 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.450
 prevents you from putting in one more if you 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.730
 prefer one with three attachments 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.130
 there was the criterion is more personal taste 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.170
 even as the first advantage I 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.760
 I would choose the ballistic vest because I 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.140
 I always get very exposed when I 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.450
 I'll take the flag and die to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.570
 grenades and 4 when you are almost 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.850
 Capturing is tense, or I'm dying of anger. 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.770
 then ballistic vest to play 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.860
 dominich means indispensable 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.680
 and here comes the complement to for this 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.330
 first snow to say is so in the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.160
 my opinion is quite valid that it would 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.440
 add light weight as second 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.420
 advantage in the first lot as many already 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.940
 they said I also agree 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.480
 block 2 is much smaller than 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.920
 there favors the use of SMG but with weight 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.410
 take the character is with a 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.240
 greater mobility and the fact that you 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.500
 did not suffer damage when you jump from a 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.570
 slightly higher height 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.880
 This helps hell and believe this. 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.400
 saves lives but it seems an advantage 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.780
 simple but it is not not very good as 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.150
 second advantage 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.440
 I would use obstinacy and if I think 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.959
 perhaps the best advantage of 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.180
 lot 2 possibilities that take away the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.609
 cap look at the sky do not like me 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.010
 would also mention the equipment 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.290
 heavy that you do not go without a map 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.570
 help a lot but still obina 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.640
 So for me it's the best and kind of him not 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.930
 open hand can changed to match 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.420
 plus some with the equipment itself 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.240
 heavy with the case but he in my 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.130
 class has a guaranteed presence in the 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.950
 third batch or dexterity 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.630
 although in my opinion it will be 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.910
 the best advantages that we can 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.190
 choose everyone here is very good 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.050
 like I said before I run a lot for 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.820
 map then I need to have a more 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.230
 fast than the enemy and sometimes you 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.760
 to look faster when you are 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.400
 running is key 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.470
 if you're already more conservative if it's more 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.530
 careful thank you, I think the engineer 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.390
 is a good order also as secondary 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.790
 I would use 4 40 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.400
 although it was a mere fairy yet 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.950
 I think it's like a mini smg was fine 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.470
 quick on the shots and with grenades 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.710
 our glorious contest or the grenade 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.340
 pn nec is of electromagnetic pulse and as 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.770
 lethal ones and 400 ex but I think 4 and 4 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.110
 is more stylish delegate remembering that 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.120
 This class is for sleeping or 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.040
 location of the way also e.g. 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.110
 that you get very exposed but 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.490
 You play one stayed with fame and with 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.260
 own tvn 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.420
 there I would change a little attachment myself 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.850
 I would put a muffler in order not to 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.890
 so exposed and in the advantages 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.360
 I would trade the vest over the hard line. 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.220
 because that way you can get the 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.170
 your cuts faster and you no longer 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.830
 You gotta worry so much, let's just say. 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.330
 so with grenades or c4 and would place 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.370
 plus an advantage of lots 2 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.990
 would probably be opportunistic not to 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.870
 run the risk of running out of bullet in the gun 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.120
 that I think is best for me and would take away 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.120
 the tactical grenade would only be with the 4 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.950
 even this class I mentioned is a 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.900
 I've been using it, I've been doing it. 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.360
 this has been satisfied with the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.070
 result but to help you , you are 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.230
 somehow remembering that this 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.940
 again it's just a suggestion of mine 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.430
 be you have a better combination 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.800
 and leave comments if you do something 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.840
 different uses something different so that I 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.490
 can also test to invest for me she 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.720
 It's as good as the one I 'm 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.220
 using beauty 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.650
 I'll stay here I hope 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.000
 you have enjoyed if they liked you want 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.320
 Contribute with the phone that the favorite

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.850
 I thank you for not registering.
