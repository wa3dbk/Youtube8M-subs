00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.580 
boost so we'll get x a you know when we
fly<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.310> hold<00:02:31.310> our<00:02:31.519> we<00:02:31.940> go<00:02:32.150> super<00:02:32.540> fast<00:02:35.590> so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
fly and hold our we go super fast so

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.170 
fly and hold our we go super fast so
that's<00:02:36.709> always<00:02:36.950> good<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.340> then<00:02:40.670> there's<00:02:40.850> a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that's always good and then there's a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.000 
that's always good and then there's a
run<00:02:41.569> in<00:02:41.660> all<00:02:41.780> direction<00:02:42.410> will<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:42.830> get

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
run in all direction will just get

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.210 
run in all direction will just get
disable<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:45.019> means<00:02:45.260> we'll<00:02:45.739> be<00:02:45.920> able<00:02:46.040> to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
disable that that means we'll be able to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.220 
disable that that means we'll be able to
sprint<00:02:46.549> in<00:02:46.880> all<00:02:47.030> directions<00:02:47.180> even<00:02:47.959> one<00:02:48.049> week

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
sprint in all directions even one week

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.860 
sprint in all directions even one week
even<00:02:49.130> when<00:02:49.250> we<00:02:49.400> don't<00:02:49.640> even<00:02:49.880> when<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.660> don't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
even when we don't even when we don't

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.830 
even when we don't even when we don't
hold<00:02:51.260> w<00:02:51.769> will<00:02:51.920> be<00:02:51.950> holding<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.480> we'll<00:02:53.720> be

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
hold w will be holding a and we'll be

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.300 
hold w will be holding a and we'll be
sprinting<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.330> be<00:02:56.569> holding<00:02:57.049> we<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:58.069> be

doesn't<00:02:58.880> let<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.090> spring<00:02:59.330> backwards

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
doesn't let you spring backwards

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.839 
doesn't let you spring backwards
actually<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:00.530> yes<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.430> allows<00:03:01.700> you

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
actually this is a but yes it allows you

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.309 
actually this is a but yes it allows you
to<00:03:01.970> sprint<00:03:02.269> backwards<00:03:02.750> as<00:03:02.930> well

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
to sprint backwards as well

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.880 
to sprint backwards as well
now<00:03:03.890> as<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.160> sprint<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.790> side<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.019> that's

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
now as you sprint to the side so that's

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.550 
now as you sprint to the side so that's
that's<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:08.060> good<00:03:08.299> for<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.600> mod<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.109> this

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that's really good for this mod and this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.050 
that's really good for this mod and this
mods<00:03:09.769> really<00:03:10.100> great<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.579> new<00:03:10.700> update

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
mods really great with the new update

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.720 
mods really great with the new update
because<00:03:11.390> as<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.930> mentioned<00:03:11.959> earlier<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.519> is

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
because as I mentioned earlier it is

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.840 
because as I mentioned earlier it is
really<00:03:14.209> really<00:03:14.420> dodgy<00:03:14.980> what<00:03:15.980> really<00:03:16.340> really

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
really really dodgy what really really

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.319 
really really dodgy what really really
hard<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.859> it's<00:03:18.859> really<00:03:19.010> hard<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.519> double<00:03:19.790> tap<00:03:19.970> w

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
hard to it's really hard to double tap w

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.120 
hard to it's really hard to double tap w
especially<00:03:20.750> even<00:03:20.959> your<00:03:21.079> pvping<00:03:21.769> when<00:03:21.980> you're

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
especially even your pvping when you're

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.270 
especially even your pvping when you're
in<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.280> PvP<00:03:22.880> match<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.450> some<00:03:23.660> sort<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.920> really

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
in a PvP match of some sort it is really

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.150 
in a PvP match of some sort it is really
hard<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.670> double<00:03:26.060> tap<00:03:26.180> W<00:03:26.650> because<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.980> is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
hard to double tap W because it is

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.280 
hard to double tap W because it is
really<00:03:28.400> delayed<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.359> sometimes<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.019> actually

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
really delayed and sometimes it actually

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.400 
really delayed and sometimes it actually
doesn't<00:03:30.440> work<00:03:30.650> at<00:03:30.859> all<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:32.600> does<00:03:32.810> not<00:03:32.840> work<00:03:33.200> at

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
doesn't work at all it does not work at

doesn't work at all it does not work at
all<00:03:33.560> sometimes<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.959> I'm<00:03:36.109> sprinting<00:03:36.970> and

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
all sometimes now I'm sprinting and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.210 
all sometimes now I'm sprinting and
there's<00:03:38.840> other<00:03:39.019> there's<00:03:39.410> other<00:03:39.530> times<00:03:39.859> where
