install<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.800> shader<00:00:56.399> mod<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.440> GLSL<00:00:58.850> and<00:01:00.829> then

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
install a shader mod I use GLSL and then

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.179 
install a shader mod I use GLSL and then
also<00:01:02.160> some<00:01:02.520> shader<00:01:02.820> packs<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.430> plenty

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
also some shader packs and I have plenty

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.300 
also some shader packs and I have plenty
so<00:01:08.189> yeah<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.650> you're<00:01:10.830> gonna<00:01:10.920> want<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
do is probably go through these packs

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
do is probably go through these packs
and<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:15.990> ones<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.409> without<00:01:17.310> any

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.190 
what then what you're gonna want to do
is<00:01:37.799> extract<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.090> we'll<00:01:39.450> choose<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.049> at

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is extract and we'll choose this one at

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.539 
is extract and we'll choose this one at
random<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.780> extract<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> files

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
random we're going to extract the files

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.460 
random we're going to extract the files
bring<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> across<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:46.020> like

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
bring that across there just just like

that using windows and that's going to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.450 
that using windows and that's going to
create<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.740> folder<00:01:50.460> um<00:01:51.829> where<00:01:52.829> did<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.310> go

there we go
a<00:01:54.149> folder<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> here

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
a folder like this then if we go in here

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.209 
a folder like this then if we go in here
normally<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.409> find<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.770> shaders

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
normally you're gonna find a shaders

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
normally you're gonna find a shaders
folder<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.490> some<00:02:02.670> an<00:02:03.240> exception

that I know after this which I'll come

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.600 
that I know after this which I'll come
to<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> moment<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.770> go<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> shaders

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
to in a moment so we go into the shaders

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.609 
to in a moment so we go into the shaders
and<00:02:08.819> we're<00:02:09.270> gonna<00:02:09.390> find<00:02:09.720> G<00:02:10.170> buffers

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
and we're gonna find G buffers

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.880 
and we're gonna find G buffers

it's<00:02:24.000> awesome<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.069> what<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:26.610> going

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
it's awesome and then what we are going

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.410 
it's awesome and then what we are going
to<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.599> we're<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.470> search<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:29.420> some

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
to do is we're going to search for some

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.110 
to do is we're going to search for some
terms<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> we're<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.819> search<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
terms so we're going to search for this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.150 
terms so we're going to search for this
text<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.440> ctrl<00:02:38.310> F<00:02:39.980> find<00:02:40.980> next<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:43.160> there

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
text here so ctrl F find next and there

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.729 
text here so ctrl F find next and there
you<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.209> there

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
you go we can see that there

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.420 
you go we can see that there
if<00:02:46.739> entity<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.180> basically<00:02:48.720> defining

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
if entity so this is basically defining

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.550 
if entity so this is basically defining
water<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.910> flowing<00:02:51.720> water<00:02:51.870> believe<00:02:52.380> it's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
water and flowing water believe it's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.199 
water and flowing water believe it's
that<00:02:52.709> way<00:02:52.829> around<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.670> what<00:02:53.880> we're<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that way around so what we're going to

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.539 
that way around so what we're going to
do<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.630> we're<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.959> add<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.530> whole<00:02:56.130> load

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
do is we're going to add in a whole load

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.119 
do is we're going to add in a whole load
of<00:02:56.579> other<00:02:56.970> IDs<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:58.379> account<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.950> terra

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
of other IDs to account for the terra

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.740 
of other IDs to account for the terra
firma<00:02:59.340> craft<00:02:59.959> water<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:02.030> take<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.239> text<00:03:03.510> here

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
firma craft water so take that text here

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.210 
firma craft water so take that text here
and<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.049> will<00:03:04.200> put<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.560> text<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.099> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and I will put this text in the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.670 
and I will put this text in the
description<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.310> we're<00:03:09.000> gonna<00:03:09.090> put<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.450> in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
description and we're gonna put that in

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.470 
description and we're gonna put that in
so<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.890> kind<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.129> between<00:03:11.519> where<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> 9.0

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so it's kind of between where the 9.0

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.449 
so it's kind of between where the 9.0
was<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.769> bracket<00:03:15.319> with<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.349> space<00:03:16.739> there

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
was and the bracket with a space there

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.460 
was and the bracket with a space there
so<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.790> what<00:03:20.970> we're<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.239> do<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.900> we're

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
so then what we're going to do is we're

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.039 
so then what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.620> ctrl<00:03:23.549> F<00:03:23.790> find<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.299> next<00:03:24.569> one

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
going to ctrl F find the next one

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.050 
going to ctrl F find the next one
so<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.250> found<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:28.340> okay<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.880> this

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
so it's found that okay so in this

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.449 
so it's found that okay so in this
particular<00:03:30.359> shade<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.900> pack<00:03:31.109> it<00:03:31.530> only<00:03:32.040> appears

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
particular shade of pack it only appears

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.990 
particular shade of pack it only appears
once<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.940> motion<00:03:33.690> packs<00:03:34.319> I've<00:03:34.500> modified<00:03:35.000> this

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
once in motion packs I've modified this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.569 
once in motion packs I've modified this
line<00:03:36.299> actually<00:03:36.630> appears<00:03:37.260> twice<00:03:37.620> once<00:03:38.130> to

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
line actually appears twice once to

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.089 
line actually appears twice once to
control<00:03:39.060> reflective<00:03:39.810> reflectivity<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
control reflective reflectivity and

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.900 
control reflective reflectivity and
wants<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.819> control<00:03:42.299> whether<00:03:43.019> or<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
wants to control whether or not the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.559 
wants to control whether or not the
waivers<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.030> waves<00:03:45.389> are<00:03:45.569> up<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> down<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.540> you

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
waivers of waves are up and down so you

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.990 
waivers of waves are up and down so you
need<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.200> change<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.769> each<00:03:50.130> time<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.849> this

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
need to change it each time that this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.930 
need to change it each time that this
these<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:52.079> entity<00:03:52.380> references<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.400> you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
these this entity references here you

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.699 
these this entity references here you
don't<00:03:54.060> need<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.389> search<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.019> whole<00:03:55.230> text

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
don't need to search for the whole text

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.159 
don't need to search for the whole text
you<00:03:55.859> could<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.310> search<00:03:56.549> for<00:03:56.720> well<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.019> word

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
you could just search for well the word

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.949 
you could just search for well the word
entity<00:03:58.739> comes<00:03:59.700> up<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.000> few<00:04:00.030> times<00:04:00.419> but<00:04:00.780> that

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
entity comes up a few times but that

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.620 
entity comes up a few times but that
would<00:04:01.079> be<00:04:01.109> one<00:04:01.349> way<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.650> finding<00:04:01.889> it<00:04:02.250> or<00:04:04.099> 8.0

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
would be one way of finding it or 8.0

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.270 
would be one way of finding it or 8.0
will<00:04:06.630> probably<00:04:06.989> get<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.500> correct

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
will probably get you to the correct

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.580 
will probably get you to the correct
line<00:04:08.519> as<00:04:08.730> well<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.720> important<00:04:10.109> thing<00:04:10.349> is

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
line as well and the important thing is

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.789 
line as well and the important thing is
you<00:04:10.889> leave<00:04:11.099> these<00:04:12.079> identities<00:04:13.079> here<00:04:13.380> because

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
you leave these identities here because

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.580 
you leave these identities here because
I<00:04:13.919> believe<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:15.389> default<00:04:15.840> water<00:04:16.289> gets

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
I believe this is the default water gets

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.610 
I believe this is the default water gets
per<00:04:16.799> co-opted<00:04:17.700> as<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.060> salt<00:04:18.329> water<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:19.200> you

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
per co-opted as the salt water and you

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.330 
per co-opted as the salt water and you
add<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.450> all<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.690> these<00:04:21.810> entity<00:04:22.320> IDs<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
add the all of these entity IDs on the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.420 
add the all of these entity IDs on the
end<00:04:23.570> okay<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.840> before<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.979> close

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
end okay and before the close

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.610 
end okay and before the close
of<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.850> code<00:04:27.030> bracket<00:04:28.460> then<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.639> save<00:04:29.970> it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
of the code bracket then you save it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.159 
of the code bracket then you save it
close<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.240> are<00:04:33.240> done<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.870> can

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
close it and you are done you can

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.129 
close it and you are done you can
actually<00:04:35.240> if<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.449> can<00:04:36.690> pull<00:04:36.930> up<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:39.050> pull<00:04:40.050> up

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
actually if I can pull up that pull up

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.629 
actually if I can pull up that pull up
the<00:04:40.229> correct<00:04:40.500> Explorer<00:04:41.100> window<00:04:42.500> there<00:04:43.500> we<00:04:43.620> go

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
the correct Explorer window there we go

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.850 
the correct Explorer window there we go
you<00:04:45.060> can<00:04:45.240> actually<00:04:45.389> use<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:46.350> shader<00:04:46.620> pack

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
you can actually use the shader pack

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.029 
you can actually use the shader pack
there<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.340> its<00:04:47.550> unzipped<00:04:48.030> form<00:04:48.830> which<00:04:49.830> is

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
there in its unzipped form which is

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.840 
there in its unzipped form which is
awesome<00:04:50.539> if<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.900> want<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.889> Rees<00:04:53.280> if<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.669> for

awesome if you want to Rees if it for
some<00:04:53.970> reason<00:04:54.389> you<00:04:54.810> need<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.050> zip<00:04:55.380> up<00:04:55.620> this

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
some reason you need to zip up this

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.930 
some reason you need to zip up this
folder<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.970> rename<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.660> if<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.770> dip<00:04:59.070> this

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
folder and rename it if you dip this

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.300 
folder and rename it if you dip this
folder<00:05:00.539> then<00:05:01.169> you'll<00:05:01.320> get<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.710> zip<00:05:02.070> file<00:05:02.280> that

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
folder then you'll get a zip file that

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.879 
folder then you'll get a zip file that
contains<00:05:02.849> a<00:05:03.000> folder<00:05:03.330> called<00:05:03.509> Zeke's<00:05:04.349> version

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.120 
know how to use GLSL shaitan art or
whether<00:05:36.330> that<00:05:36.419> particular<00:05:37.289> mod<00:05:37.680> doesn't<00:05:38.010> let

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
whether that particular mod doesn't let

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.420 
whether that particular mod doesn't let
you<00:05:38.250> select<00:05:38.639> different<00:05:38.789> levels<00:05:39.330> or<00:05:39.510> something

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
you select different levels or something

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.089 
you select different levels or something
but<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.520> always<00:05:41.669> seems<00:05:42.000> to<00:05:42.060> select<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.720> low<00:05:43.099> so

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
but it always seems to select the low so

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.719 
but it always seems to select the low so
what<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.400> simply<00:05:44.909> do<00:05:45.090> is<00:05:45.389> I<00:05:45.690> just<00:05:45.720> grab<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:47.220> the

water and you can see I've made the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.080 
water and you can see I've made the
change<00:06:29.789> at<00:06:30.509> both<00:06:31.050> places<00:06:31.440> and<00:06:31.909> that<00:06:32.909> is

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
change at both places and that is

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.909 
change at both places and that is
basically<00:06:33.539> it<00:06:33.840> that<00:06:34.349> will<00:06:34.560> give<00:06:34.710> you<00:06:34.889> a

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350

that is but it may well break it if it's
not<00:07:21.500> there<00:07:21.670> anyway<00:07:22.670> so<00:07:22.880> that<00:07:23.630> is<00:07:23.810> it<00:07:24.080> basically
