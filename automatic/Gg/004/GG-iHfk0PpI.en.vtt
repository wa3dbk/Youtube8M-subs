with<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.390> pop<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.409> EF<00:01:46.680> X<00:01:46.950> replica<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
with this pop it is an EF X replica I

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.950 
with this pop it is an EF X replica I
have<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> review<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
have a review of that if you want to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
have a review of that if you want to
check<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> show<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
check it out but I just want to show you

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.679 
check it out but I just want to show you
that<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.640> comparison<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> didn't<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that as comparison I didn't want you to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.420 
that as comparison I didn't want you to
think<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> comes<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> pop<00:01:53.009> itself

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
think that it comes with the pop itself

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
think that it comes with the pop itself
but<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> pop<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:54.960> good<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.320> really

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
but this pop is pretty good I really

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
but this pop is pretty good I really
like<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> big<00:01:56.579> fan<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> Clark<00:01:57.270> Gregg<00:01:57.450> as

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
like it I'm a big fan of Clark Gregg as

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.940 
like it I'm a big fan of Clark Gregg as
an<00:01:57.780> actor<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> director<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> think

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
an actor and as a director so I think

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
an actor and as a director so I think
it's<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.189> cool<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.579> him<00:01:59.670> in<00:02:00.030> pop<00:02:00.360> form

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it's really cool to have him in pop form

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780 
it's really cool to have him in pop form
and<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.710> dug<00:02:01.860> Agent<00:02:02.159> Coulson<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.700> all

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and I really dug Agent Coulson in all

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.980 
and I really dug Agent Coulson in all
the<00:02:02.909> Marvel<00:02:03.149> movies<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.570> he's<00:02:03.810> awesome

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
