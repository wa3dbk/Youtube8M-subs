advanced safety features for car seats

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.580 
advanced safety features for car seats
we<00:00:22.640> study<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.000> science<00:00:23.420> behind<00:00:23.630> car<00:00:24.080> crashes

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
we study the science behind car crashes

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.590 
we study the science behind car crashes
because<00:00:25.460> accidents<00:00:25.790> can<00:00:26.090> come<00:00:26.270> from<00:00:26.480> any

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
because accidents can come from any

at<00:00:31.070> Britax<00:00:31.700> we<00:00:32.330> reverse<00:00:32.630> that<00:00:32.660> principle

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
at Britax we reverse that principle

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.710 
at Britax we reverse that principle
turning<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.250> into<00:00:34.340> 360<00:00:35.270> degrees<00:00:35.570> of

turning it into 360 degrees of
protection<00:00:37.330> then<00:00:38.330> we<00:00:38.600> design<00:00:38.989> our<00:00:39.200> seats<00:00:39.680> so

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
protection then we design our seats so
