00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.110
 ah 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello today I 'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.379
 Americas puff pastry is a recipe 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.549
 very very easy to do in one thing 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.080
 you have it done and you are 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.880
 delicious let's go to it 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.520
 to make the palmeritas you're going to 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.590
 need puff pastry if it can be a 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.580
 brand that has a rectangular shape which 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.140
 buy them from the sugar leader if 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.450
 you want the texture of the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.900
 sugar you can buy icing sugar and a 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.900
 roller 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.520
 to start we put sugar in all the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.079
 work surface you have to put 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.489
 quite sugar since it is the only 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.769
 ingredient that this recipe carries 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.950
 it also depends on reduces that iso 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.260
 the palmeritas 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.540
 now we separate the puff pastry from the paper 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 from the oven and spread it on top of the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.370
 sugar 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.370
 Y 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.909
 we throw more sugar over the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.909
 puff pastry and we distribute it well 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.060
 a massa not a little bit so that it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.060
 integrate the sugar and the puff pastry 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.890
 now welcomes one end of the iron 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.650
 of puff pastry and it will take half the beam 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 the same with the other side 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.730
 repeat the same operation again 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.250
 first on one side and then on the other 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.340
 finally put one end on top of the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.429
 another as well as the hole 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.289
 reserve your roll of palmeritas collects 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.689
 the sugar left over and we're going to prepare the 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.350
 oven tray now let's cut 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.240
 the palmeritas 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.369
 protect the surface where you go 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.080
 make the cuts I've put a 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.360
 baking paper so as not to scratch the table 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.650
 cut into portions of plus or minus 1 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.630
 centimeter thick 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.190
 the knife has to be sharp 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 if you're not going to have any trinkets 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.330
 place one in one of the palmeritas 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.550
 on top of the tray 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.740
 do not forget to leave a small separation 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.880
 between them because they grow in the oven if 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.880
 they would pay each other 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.769
 preheat the oven to 210 degrees 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.000
 I hope it's hot in my case 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.530
 when the oven reaches the temperature 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.530
 the red pilot goes off 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.530
 insert the palmeritas into the oven and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.530
 wait for them to get golden 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.019
 It took me 11 minutes 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.190
 ah 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.920
 take out the tray from the oven and wait for 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.920
 the puff will cool a bit 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.430
 then with the palmeritas one by one 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.819
 in a grid so that they finish 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.819
 cool 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.370
 We do this because the tray of the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.500
 The oven is still hot and the palmeritas are 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.930
 they would continue cooking 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.130
 and you already have your palmeritas 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.130
 sugar ready to eat 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.650
 they look good 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.420
 this has been the recipe today I hope that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 you encourage to do it and that you do it
