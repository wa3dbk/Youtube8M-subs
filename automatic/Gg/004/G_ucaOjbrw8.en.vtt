side and I'm actually quite clever did

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.890 
side and I'm actually quite clever did
that<00:00:14.830> because<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:18.220> but<00:00:18.490> it<00:00:18.670> does<00:00:18.940> just

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
that because here but it does just

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.320 
that because here but it does just
greatly<00:00:20.289> improve<00:00:20.680> my<00:00:21.460> chances<00:00:21.760> are<00:00:22.090> getting

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
greatly improve my chances are getting

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.060 
greatly improve my chances are getting
the<00:00:22.390> dip<00:00:22.600> out<00:00:22.780> without<00:00:23.470> too<00:00:23.710> much<00:00:23.830> of<00:00:23.980> a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
the dip out without too much of a

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.540 
the dip out without too much of a
struggle<00:00:24.310> i<00:00:24.520> think<00:00:24.760> so<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.890> I'm<00:00:27.039> planning<00:00:27.279> on

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
struggle i think so what I'm planning on

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.710 
struggle i think so what I'm planning on
doing<00:00:27.609> now<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.740> drain<00:00:30.510> drain<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.660> oil

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
doing now is the drain drain the oil

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.049 
doing now is the drain drain the oil
from<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.109> diff<00:00:32.379> which<00:00:33.190> comes<00:00:33.489> out<00:00:33.609> this<00:00:33.760> plug

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
from the diff which comes out this plug

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.059 
from the diff which comes out this plug
here<00:00:34.329> it's<00:00:34.839> just<00:00:35.019> a<00:00:35.109> 13-mile<00:00:35.679> spanner<00:00:36.039> and<00:00:38.069> get

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.069 
here it's just a 13-mile spanner and get

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:45.259 
here it's just a 13-mile spanner and get
all<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.399> old<00:00:39.579> oil<00:00:39.760> out<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:42.219> there's<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
all the old oil out and then there's I

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.270 
all the old oil out and then there's I
think<00:00:46.269> I'll<00:00:46.420> probably<00:00:46.629> remove<00:00:47.139> the<00:00:47.409> drive

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
think I'll probably remove the drive

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.259 
think I'll probably remove the drive
shaft<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.789> prop<00:00:48.969> shaft<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:52.589> held<00:00:53.589> on<00:00:54.269> by

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
shaft the prop shaft which is held on by

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.660 
shaft the prop shaft which is held on by
four<00:00:55.539> bolts<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:58.059> if<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.449> can<00:00:58.569> see<00:00:58.749> them<00:00:58.899> yeah

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
four bolts know if you can see them yeah

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.009 
four bolts know if you can see them yeah
there<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.760> can<00:01:00.909> see<00:01:01.059> as<00:01:01.149> I<00:01:01.269> turn<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.780> prop

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
there you can see as I turn the prop

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.490 
there you can see as I turn the prop
there's<00:01:02.469> one<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:04.080> three<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.350> there's

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
there's one two three and there's

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.070 
there's one two three and there's
another<00:01:05.650> one<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.460> they<00:01:07.360> look<00:01:07.540> easy<00:01:07.750> enough<00:01:08.050> to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
another one so they look easy enough to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.220 
another one so they look easy enough to
undo<00:01:08.500> now<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.040> prop<00:01:09.340> shaft<00:01:09.370> on<00:01:09.820> these<00:01:10.230> is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
undo now the prop shaft on these is

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.440 
undo now the prop shaft on these is
actually<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:12.310> pushed<00:01:12.640> straight<00:01:13.060> into<00:01:13.420> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
actually just pushed straight into the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.550 
actually just pushed straight into the
gearbox<00:01:13.930> here<00:01:14.350> on<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.670> spline<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.560> there's

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
gearbox here on a spline and there's

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.580 
gearbox here on a spline and there's
nothing<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.950> keep<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.460> oil<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.850> gearbox

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
nothing to keep the oil in the gearbox

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.990 
nothing to keep the oil in the gearbox
I'm<00:01:20.590> hoping<00:01:20.830> because<00:01:21.160> my<00:01:21.400> car's<00:01:21.700> tipped

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
I'm hoping because my car's tipped

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.180 
I'm hoping because my car's tipped
forwards<00:01:22.510> with<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.200> back<00:01:23.380> being<00:01:23.710> jacked<00:01:23.950> up

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
forwards with the back being jacked up

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.520 
forwards with the back being jacked up
that<00:01:25.000> I'm<00:01:25.540> not<00:01:25.690> going<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.870> lose<00:01:25.960> any<00:01:26.020> oil<00:01:26.380> out

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
that I'm not going to lose any oil out

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.010 
that I'm not going to lose any oil out
of<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.650> gearbox<00:01:27.070> there<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:28.060> know<00:01:28.570> for<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.990> fact

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
of the gearbox there I know for a fact

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.750 
of the gearbox there I know for a fact
if<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.440> was<00:01:29.560> jacked<00:01:29.800> up<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.190> other<00:01:30.310> way<00:01:30.550> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
if it was jacked up the other way the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.560 
if it was jacked up the other way the
oil<00:01:31.000> would<00:01:31.270> fall<00:01:31.510> back<00:01:31.830> so<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.180> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
oil would fall back so because the the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.370 
oil would fall back so because the the
nose<00:01:34.900> on<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.290> prop<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.870> seal

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
nose on the prop is the is the seal

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.200 
nose on the prop is the is the seal
really<00:01:38.980> that's<00:01:39.370> what<00:01:39.520> keeps<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.880> oil<00:01:39.910> in

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
really that's what keeps the oil in

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.770 
really that's what keeps the oil in
there<00:01:41.160> so<00:01:42.160> I'm<00:01:42.490> probably<00:01:43.150> just<00:01:43.390> going<00:01:43.659> to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
there so I'm probably just going to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.040 
there so I'm probably just going to
drain<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.350> oil<00:01:45.060> remove<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.240> prop<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.750> then

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
drain the oil remove the prop and then

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.260 
drain the oil remove the prop and then
loosen<00:01:47.740> these<00:01:48.480> mounting<00:01:49.480> bolts<00:01:49.870> here<00:01:50.800> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
loosen these mounting bolts here and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.930 
loosen these mounting bolts here and
here<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:53.170> above<00:01:53.500> for<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.250> diff<00:01:54.550> I<00:01:54.760> don't

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
here and to above for the diff I don't

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.370 
here and to above for the diff I don't
think<00:01:54.970> I'll<00:01:55.210> just<00:01:55.360> loosen<00:01:55.840> them<00:01:55.960> all<00:01:56.080> and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
think I'll just loosen them all and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.130 
think I'll just loosen them all and
there's<00:01:56.560> another<00:01:56.800> one<00:01:57.070> there<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.810> can<00:01:59.110> see

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
there's another one there you can see

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.870 
there's another one there you can see
pointing<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.100> camera<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.490> totally<00:02:00.790> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
pointing the camera and totally the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.760 
pointing the camera and totally the
wrong<00:02:01.000> direction<00:02:01.210> there<00:02:01.690> we<00:02:01.750> go<00:02:01.840> there's<00:02:02.530> one

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
wrong direction there we go there's one

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.070 
wrong direction there we go there's one
there<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:04.360> there

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.400 

as<00:02:09.290> well<00:02:10.210> so<00:02:11.210> I<00:02:13.390> think<00:02:14.390> I'll<00:02:14.600> just<00:02:14.630> loosen<00:02:15.260> them

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
as well so I think I'll just loosen them

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.370 
as well so I think I'll just loosen them
all<00:02:15.560> off<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.420> I'll<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> gauge<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
all off and I'll get a gauge of the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.790 
all off and I'll get a gauge of the
weight<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:20.030> diff<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.570> see<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.620> can

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
weight of the diff and see if I can

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.390 
weight of the diff and see if I can
manage<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.190> by<00:02:22.310> myself<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.630> not<00:02:23.870> i'll<00:02:24.440> i'll

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
manage it by myself and if not i'll i'll

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
manage it by myself and if not i'll i'll
wait<00:02:25.730> until<00:02:26.000> i<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.120> get<00:02:26.420> friend<00:02:26.690> around<00:02:26.870> to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
wait until i can get friend around to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.320 
wait until i can get friend around to
give<00:02:27.200> me<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> lift<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.710> our<00:02:27.770> think<00:02:28.330> certain

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
give me a lift with our think certain

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.970 
give me a lift with our think certain
you<00:02:29.390> don't<00:02:29.450> want<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.720> be<00:02:30.290> ending<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.620> dropping

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
you don't want to be ending up dropping

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.520 
you don't want to be ending up dropping
that<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.310> either<00:02:32.210> damaging<00:02:32.780> myself<00:02:32.960> or<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
that and either damaging myself or the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.520 
that and either damaging myself or the
diff<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:35.030> that's<00:02:35.810> what<00:02:35.960> i'm<00:02:36.020> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.350> for

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
diff so that's what i'm going to do for

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.440 
diff so that's what i'm going to do for
now<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> oil<00:02:37.310> out<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.670> loosen<00:02:38.390> a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
now just get the oil out and loosen a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.090 
now just get the oil out and loosen a
few<00:02:38.480> bolts<00:02:38.780> off<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.160> for<00:02:40.220> now<00:02:42.070> ok<00:02:43.070> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
few bolts off so that's it for now ok a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.220 
few bolts off so that's it for now ok a
little<00:02:43.310> bit<00:02:43.490> more<00:02:43.610> progress<00:02:44.000> that's<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.540> prop

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
little bit more progress that's the prop

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770 
little bit more progress that's the prop
shaft<00:02:45.260> removed<00:02:45.800> there<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.460> as<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.750> see

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
shaft removed there and as you can see

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.040 
shaft removed there and as you can see
we<00:02:48.200> look<00:02:48.350> up<00:02:48.500> into<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.830> transmission<00:02:49.760> tunnel

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
we look up into the transmission tunnel

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.160 
we look up into the transmission tunnel
there<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.530> end<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.640> gearbox<00:02:53.170> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
there is the end of the gearbox the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.320 
there is the end of the gearbox the
spline<00:02:54.590> where<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.490> prop<00:02:55.670> shaft<00:02:55.700> goes<00:02:56.090> in

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
spline where the the prop shaft goes in

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.110 
spline where the the prop shaft goes in
at<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.570> end<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:58.160> handbrake<00:02:58.550> cable<00:02:58.760> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
at that end and the handbrake cable you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.970 
at that end and the handbrake cable you
can<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.450> up<00:02:59.570> there<00:02:59.750> as<00:02:59.930> well<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.530> can<00:03:00.680> see<00:03:00.860> how

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
can see up there as well you can see how

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.550 
can see up there as well you can see how
in<00:03:01.310> excess<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.760> all<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.270> stuff<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.080> really<00:03:03.350> if

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
in excess of all this stuff is really if

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.230 
in excess of all this stuff is really if
you're<00:03:03.709> having<00:03:03.830> trouble<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.490> you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
you're having trouble with it you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.949 
you're having trouble with it you
imagine<00:03:05.600> if<00:03:05.720> you've<00:03:05.840> got<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.170> exhaust<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
imagine if you've got the exhaust on and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.600 
imagine if you've got the exhaust on and
everything<00:03:08.959> else<00:03:09.320> that<00:03:09.620> belongs<00:03:10.070> underneath

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
everything else that belongs underneath

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.290 
everything else that belongs underneath
here<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.780> go<00:03:11.959> real<00:03:12.290> pain<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.580> backside<00:03:13.850> to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
here you go real pain in the backside to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.979 
here you go real pain in the backside to
do<00:03:14.480> some<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.780> these<00:03:14.870> jobs<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:16.570> there<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.870> know

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
do some of these jobs but there you know

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.150 
do some of these jobs but there you know
you<00:03:18.260> they<00:03:18.410> have<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> be<00:03:18.800> done<00:03:18.980> unfortunately

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
you they have to be done unfortunately

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.800 
you they have to be done unfortunately
so<00:03:20.060> that's<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.200> way<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:23.300> then<00:03:23.510> at<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
so that's the way it is and then at the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.690 
so that's the way it is and then at the
other<00:03:23.840> end<00:03:24.200> here<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:26.000> can<00:03:26.150> see<00:03:26.420> that's<00:03:26.690> the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
other end here you can see that's the

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.870 
other end here you can see that's the
that's<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.850> speedometer<00:03:29.920> sensor<00:03:30.920> at<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.670> top

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
that's the speedometer sensor at the top

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.060 
that's the speedometer sensor at the top
there<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:32.959> up<00:03:33.080> there<00:03:33.170> thinking<00:03:33.470> again<00:03:33.860> you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
there just up there thinking again you

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.440 
there just up there thinking again you
can<00:03:34.250> imagine<00:03:34.489> if<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.910> have<00:03:35.060> trouble<00:03:35.209> with

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
can imagine if you have trouble with

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.660 
can imagine if you have trouble with
that<00:03:35.680> there's<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.890> be<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.040> real<00:03:37.310> pain<00:03:37.610> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
that there's going to be a real pain to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.300 
that there's going to be a real pain to
to<00:03:38.570> replace<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.500> though<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.739> unlikely<00:03:39.890> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
to replace and though it's unlikely to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.210 
to replace and though it's unlikely to
get<00:03:40.430> damaged<00:03:40.820> up<00:03:41.030> there<00:03:41.320> but<00:03:42.320> if<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.100> know

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
get damaged up there but if it you know

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.910 
get damaged up there but if it you know
if<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.459> went<00:03:43.580> faulty<00:03:44.150> or<00:03:44.650> something<00:03:45.650> happened

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
if it went faulty or something happened

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.680 
if it went faulty or something happened
to<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.430> speedometer<00:03:46.760> wasn't<00:03:47.300> working

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
to that the speedometer wasn't working

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.050 
to that the speedometer wasn't working
that's<00:03:48.560> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.920> be<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.100> real<00:03:49.340> pain<00:03:49.760> in<00:03:49.820> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that's going to be a real pain in the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.590 
that's going to be a real pain in the
backside<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.720> have<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.019> rip<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:52.040> out<00:03:52.100> and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
backside to have to rip that out and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.180 
backside to have to rip that out and
swap<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.750> over<00:03:54.080> these<00:03:54.739> are<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.950> teeth

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
swap it over these are the teeth

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.979 
swap it over these are the teeth
obviously<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:58.519> sensor<00:03:59.420> counts<00:03:59.750> as<00:03:59.870> it

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
obviously that the sensor counts as it

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.490 
obviously that the sensor counts as it
goes<00:04:00.110> around<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.690> that's<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.050> that's

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
goes around so so that's that that's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.289 
goes around so so that's that that's
that<00:04:03.620> side<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.459> I've<00:04:04.880> drained<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.269> oil

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
that side of it so I've drained the oil

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.840 
that side of it so I've drained the oil
off<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:06.650> came<00:04:06.890> out<00:04:07.010> quite<00:04:07.070> clean<00:04:07.519> as<00:04:07.730> well<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:09.380> I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
off it came out quite clean as well so I

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.100 
off it came out quite clean as well so I
was<00:04:10.850> expecting<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.450> look<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.750> bit<00:04:11.900> worse

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
was expecting it to look a bit worse

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.680 
was expecting it to look a bit worse
than<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.440> was<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:12.830> it's<00:04:13.160> not<00:04:13.640> too<00:04:13.850> bad<00:04:14.030> and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
than it was but it's not too bad and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.690 
than it was but it's not too bad and
just<00:04:15.680> another<00:04:15.890> thing<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.400> thought<00:04:16.640> might

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
just another thing that I thought might

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.080 
just another thing that I thought might
be<00:04:17.060> worth<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.419> mention<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:18.669> one<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.789> the<00:04:19.880> things

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
be worth a mention is one of the things

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.319 
be worth a mention is one of the things
I've<00:04:20.299> been<00:04:20.330> doing<00:04:20.510> as<00:04:21.049> I

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
I've been doing as I

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.409 
I've been doing as I
i<00:04:21.409> dismantle<00:04:22.409> parts<00:04:22.889> especially<00:04:23.460> rotating

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
i dismantle parts especially rotating

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.450 
i dismantle parts especially rotating
parts<00:04:24.870> like<00:04:25.110> drive<00:04:25.409> shafts<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:25.949> prop<00:04:26.159> shafts

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
parts like drive shafts and prop shafts

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.619 
parts like drive shafts and prop shafts
is<00:04:26.729> mark<00:04:27.659> them<00:04:27.960> i<00:04:28.800> just<00:04:29.639> sent<00:04:29.879> to<00:04:30.000> punch<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
is mark them i just sent to punch the

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.990 
is mark them i just sent to punch the
flange<00:04:30.930> there<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:31.710> I've<00:04:32.370> also<00:04:32.460> sent<00:04:32.909> to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
flange there and I've also sent to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.020 
flange there and I've also sent to
punched<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:34.379> corresponding<00:04:35.159> position<00:04:35.819> on

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
punched the corresponding position on

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.290 
punched the corresponding position on
the<00:04:36.240> prop<00:04:36.750> shaft<00:04:37.400> same<00:04:38.400> on<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.729> output<00:04:38.849> four

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
the prop shaft same on the output four

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.020 
the prop shaft same on the output four
ng<00:04:39.629> on<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> output<00:04:40.110> drive<00:04:40.770> shafts<00:04:41.219> as<00:04:41.370> well<00:04:41.610> at

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
ng on the output drive shafts as well at

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.459 
ng on the output drive shafts as well at
the<00:04:42.060> back<00:04:42.360> there<00:04:43.610> there<00:04:44.610> because<00:04:45.569> it's<00:04:46.139> always

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
the back there there because it's always

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.790 
the back there there because it's always
good<00:04:46.710> practice<00:04:46.889> i<00:04:47.219> think<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.550> put<00:04:47.729> parts<00:04:48.419> back

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
good practice i think to put parts back

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.080 
good practice i think to put parts back
where<00:04:49.800> they<00:04:49.919> came<00:04:49.949> from<00:04:50.129> in<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.789> exact

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
where they came from in the exact

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.200 
where they came from in the exact
position<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.400> you're<00:04:53.400> less<00:04:53.520> likely<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.940> run

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
position and you're less likely to run

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.600 
position and you're less likely to run
into<00:04:54.240> trouble<00:04:54.719> with<00:04:54.840> vibration<00:04:55.560> or<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:56.520> know

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
into trouble with vibration or you know

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.610 
into trouble with vibration or you know
it's<00:04:57.240> not<00:04:57.419> fitting<00:04:57.690> quite<00:04:58.020> as<00:04:58.199> well<00:04:58.409> as<00:04:58.469> they

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
it's not fitting quite as well as they

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.050 
it's not fitting quite as well as they
did<00:04:58.770> when<00:04:59.069> they<00:04:59.129> when<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.580> pulled<00:04:59.789> them<00:04:59.940> apart

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
did when they when you pulled them apart

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.629 
did when they when you pulled them apart
really<00:05:00.479> so<00:05:00.840> let's<00:05:01.560> think<00:05:01.919> again<00:05:02.310> good

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
really so let's think again good

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.369 
really so let's think again good
practice<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.090> mark<00:05:03.300> things<00:05:03.810> off<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:06.379> replace

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
practice to mark things off and replace

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.559 
practice to mark things off and replace
them<00:05:07.770> where<00:05:08.490> they<00:05:08.580> came<00:05:08.759> from<00:05:08.819> put<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.389> same

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
them where they came from put the same

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.860 
them where they came from put the same
bolts<00:05:09.930> into<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.259> same<00:05:10.440> holes<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.870> it's

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
bolts into the same holes and it's

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.279 
bolts into the same holes and it's
you're<00:05:13.500> less<00:05:13.680> likely<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:14.069> run<00:05:14.340> into<00:05:14.370> trouble

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
you're less likely to run into trouble

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.369 
you're less likely to run into trouble
so<00:05:16.849> final<00:05:17.849> part<00:05:18.060> for<00:05:18.270> today<00:05:18.539> is<00:05:18.599> I'm<00:05:19.110> going<00:05:19.259> to

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
so final part for today is I'm going to

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.429 
so final part for today is I'm going to
loosen<00:05:19.650> all<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:20.069> diff<00:05:20.400> bolts<00:05:21.240> off<00:05:21.449> and<00:05:21.750> then

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
loosen all the diff bolts off and then

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.050 
loosen all the diff bolts off and then
I'm<00:05:22.949> going<00:05:23.099> to<00:05:23.189> make<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.370> judgment<00:05:23.580> call<00:05:24.000> on

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
I'm going to make a judgment call on

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.559 
I'm going to make a judgment call on
whether<00:05:24.509> I<00:05:24.870> actually<00:05:25.289> remove<00:05:25.770> it<00:05:25.919> or<00:05:26.009> not

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
whether I actually remove it or not

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.879 
whether I actually remove it or not
looking<00:05:27.569> at<00:05:27.719> it<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.960> think<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.319> unlikely<00:05:28.469> I

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
looking at it I think it's unlikely I

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.209 
looking at it I think it's unlikely I
think<00:05:29.129> I'll<00:05:29.250> just<00:05:29.279> loosen<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.819> bolts<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:31.219> get

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
think I'll just loosen the bolts and get

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.879 
think I'll just loosen the bolts and get
it<00:05:32.310> ready<00:05:32.430> for<00:05:33.029> when<00:05:33.180> my<00:05:33.379> friend<00:05:34.379> comes<00:05:34.620> around

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
it ready for when my friend comes around

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.809 
it ready for when my friend comes around
then<00:05:35.490> we<00:05:35.639> can<00:05:35.819> both<00:05:36.060> live<00:05:36.330> together<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:37.819> less

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
then we can both live together and less

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.079 
then we can both live together and less
of<00:05:38.849> a<00:05:39.060> struggle<00:05:39.089> really<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:41.729> will<00:05:41.849> be<00:05:41.969> it

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
of a struggle really so that will be it

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.420 
of a struggle really so that will be it
for<00:05:42.120> today<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:42.539> think<00:05:42.889> just<00:05:43.889> loosen<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.159> bolts

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
for today I think just loosen the bolts

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.629 
for today I think just loosen the bolts
off<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.879> we'll<00:05:45.060> see<00:05:45.210> where<00:05:45.360> we<00:05:45.449> go<00:05:45.479> ok<00:05:46.639> cover

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
off and we'll see where we go ok cover

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.640 
off and we'll see where we go ok cover
the<00:05:47.789> problem<00:05:48.150> with<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.479> mountain<00:05:49.469> on<00:05:49.620> the

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
the problem with the mountain on the

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.459 
the problem with the mountain on the
diff<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.819> oven<00:05:51.479> on<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:51.690> front<00:05:51.960> ones<00:05:52.169> and

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
diff the oven on the front ones and

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.430 
diff the oven on the front ones and
they've<00:05:53.190> all<00:05:53.400> come<00:05:53.430> undone<00:05:54.029> nicely<00:05:54.750> there

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
they've all come undone nicely there

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.409 
they've all come undone nicely there
something<00:05:56.039> we're<00:05:56.129> quite<00:05:56.310> tight<00:05:56.580> but<00:05:56.789> I<00:05:56.909> must

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
something we're quite tight but I must

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.329 
something we're quite tight but I must
get<00:05:57.539> them<00:05:57.659> all<00:05:57.810> out<00:05:57.839> and<00:05:58.169> I<00:05:58.680> came<00:05:58.889> to<00:05:59.039> undo<00:05:59.310> the

00:05:59.329 --> 00:05:59.339 
get them all out and I came to undo the

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:01.550 
get them all out and I came to undo the
back<00:05:59.639> one<00:05:59.940> at<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.539> top<00:06:00.719> of<00:06:00.779> the<00:06:01.050> death<00:06:01.289> and

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
back one at the top of the death and

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.649 
back one at the top of the death and
I've<00:06:02.279> actually<00:06:02.430> found<00:06:02.819> that<00:06:03.089> the<00:06:03.210> bolt<00:06:03.419> is

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
I've actually found that the bolt is

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.700 
I've actually found that the bolt is
loose<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:05.210> if<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.300> get<00:06:06.449> a<00:06:06.509> bar<00:06:06.750> like<00:06:07.740> this<00:06:07.770> and

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
loose and if I get a bar like this and

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.730 
loose and if I get a bar like this and
put<00:06:10.710> it<00:06:10.740> underneath<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.699> day<00:06:12.060> like<00:06:12.960> that<00:06:12.990> but

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
put it underneath the day like that but

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.150 
put it underneath the day like that but
don't<00:06:13.830> if<00:06:13.979> you<00:06:14.069> can<00:06:14.219> see<00:06:14.430> both

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.340 

that<00:06:18.060> noise<00:06:18.300> that<00:06:18.990> clunking<00:06:19.500> noise<00:06:20.060> is<00:06:21.350> the

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
that noise that clunking noise is the

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.910 
that noise that clunking noise is the
exact<00:06:23.510> same<00:06:24.510> noise<00:06:24.780> that<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.110> get<00:06:25.440> as<00:06:25.650> I'm

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
exact same noise that I get as I'm

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.620 
exact same noise that I get as I'm
driving<00:06:26.070> along<00:06:28.940> right<00:06:29.940> rattles<00:06:30.420> right

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
driving along right rattles right

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.840 
driving along right rattles right
through<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.960> care<00:06:31.170> so<00:06:31.920> I'm<00:06:32.220> pretty<00:06:32.370> sure<00:06:32.640> that

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
through the care so I'm pretty sure that

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.240 
through the care so I'm pretty sure that
i<00:06:32.880> found<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.270> root<00:06:33.450> of<00:06:33.570> my<00:06:33.750> problem<00:06:34.170> is<00:06:34.860> that

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
i found the root of my problem is that

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.010 
i found the root of my problem is that
it's<00:06:35.670> not<00:06:35.850> an<00:06:36.000> internal<00:06:36.480> problem<00:06:36.660> with<00:06:36.930> the

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
it's not an internal problem with the

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.760 
it's not an internal problem with the
death<00:06:37.230> toll<00:06:37.560> it's<00:06:38.250> a<00:06:38.430> mounting<00:06:38.820> problem<00:06:39.300> and

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
death toll it's a mounting problem and

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.080 
death toll it's a mounting problem and
it<00:06:40.770> looks<00:06:40.980> as<00:06:41.100> though<00:06:41.160> what's<00:06:41.550> happened<00:06:41.970> is

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
it looks as though what's happened is

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.610 
it looks as though what's happened is
that<00:06:42.270> the<00:06:42.450> bolts<00:06:42.750> come<00:06:42.930> loose<00:06:43.140> and<00:06:43.410> it's

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
that the bolts come loose and it's

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.170 
that the bolts come loose and it's
elongated<00:06:43.980> the<00:06:44.550> mounting<00:06:44.940> bracket<00:06:45.060> holes<00:06:45.510> and

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
elongated the mounting bracket holes and

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.520 
elongated the mounting bracket holes and
it's<00:06:48.180> given<00:06:48.540> them<00:06:48.630> enough<00:06:48.840> room<00:06:49.080> to<00:06:49.230> have<00:06:49.320> some

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
it's given them enough room to have some

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.770 
it's given them enough room to have some
play<00:06:49.740> in<00:06:50.010> there<00:06:50.190> now<00:06:50.430> so<00:06:50.760> I<00:06:50.940> think<00:06:51.390> I'll<00:06:51.540> still

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
play in there now so I think I'll still

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.850 
play in there now so I think I'll still
take<00:06:51.960> the<00:06:52.080> diff<00:06:52.260> out<00:06:52.470> and<00:06:54.500> have<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.560> look<00:06:55.710> at<00:06:55.800> the

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
take the diff out and have a look at the

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.670 
take the diff out and have a look at the
bracket<00:06:56.250> and<00:06:56.370> that<00:06:56.550> but<00:06:56.880> i'm<00:06:57.720> pretty<00:06:58.110> sure<00:06:58.230> i'm

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
bracket and that but i'm pretty sure i'm

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.440 
bracket and that but i'm pretty sure i'm
not<00:06:58.800> going<00:06:58.950> to<00:06:58.980> send<00:06:59.190> it<00:06:59.250> away<00:06:59.370> now<00:06:59.670> i<00:06:59.880> think<00:07:00.000> i

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
not going to send it away now i think i

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.070 
not going to send it away now i think i
think<00:07:01.230> that<00:07:01.590> that<00:07:01.620> is<00:07:02.010> the<00:07:02.250> root<00:07:02.400> of<00:07:02.550> my<00:07:03.080> my

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
think that that is the root of my my

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.750 
think that that is the root of my my
problem<00:07:04.560> so<00:07:06.560> that's<00:07:07.560> it<00:07:07.740> for<00:07:07.770> now<00:07:08.010> just<00:07:08.550> shows

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
problem so that's it for now just shows

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.190 
problem so that's it for now just shows
you<00:07:08.970> you've<00:07:09.210> got<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.390> check<00:07:09.630> everything<00:07:09.960> on

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
you you've got to check everything on

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.650 
you you've got to check everything on
these<00:07:10.350> things
