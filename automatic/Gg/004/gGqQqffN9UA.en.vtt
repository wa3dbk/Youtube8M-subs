oars here and I figure well what better
to<00:02:42.880> stay<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.120> anyways<00:02:43.420> there's<00:02:43.959> no<00:02:44.080> sense<00:02:44.290> in

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
to stay in anyways there's no sense in

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.630 
to stay in anyways there's no sense in
switching<00:02:44.709> out<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.040> don't<00:02:45.220> need<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.430> thing

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.140 
and I was not a fitness to kill at all I
mean<00:03:08.740> seriously<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:09.250> did<00:03:09.430> not<00:03:09.640> expect<00:03:09.820> that

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
mean seriously I did not expect that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.120 
mean seriously I did not expect that
because<00:03:10.360> vileplume<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.080> rather<00:03:11.320> beastly<00:03:11.650> but

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
because vileplume is rather beastly but

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.100 
because vileplume is rather beastly but
I<00:03:12.160> supposed<00:03:12.489> his<00:03:13.000> isn't<00:03:13.360> so<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.720> decide<00:03:14.080> to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
I supposed his isn't so I decide to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.699 
I supposed his isn't so I decide to
elect<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.530> bird<00:03:14.769> which<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.370> his<00:03:15.670> Zapdos<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.709> I

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
elect a bird which is his Zapdos and I

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.140 
elect a bird which is his Zapdos and I
could<00:03:18.130> attack<00:03:18.489> because<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:18.880> think<00:03:18.940> you're

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
could attack because I think you're

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.970 
could attack because I think you're
gonna<00:03:19.300> be<00:03:19.390> slower<00:03:19.630> anyways<00:03:20.019> but<00:03:20.320> he<00:03:20.530> gets<00:03:20.800> for

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
gonna be slower anyways but he gets for

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.920 
gonna be slower anyways but he gets for
aerial<00:03:21.459> ace<00:03:21.580> out<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.880> all<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.269> strangest

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
would use aerial ace especially since it

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.610 
would use aerial ace especially since it
gets<00:03:26.680> drill<00:03:26.950> peck<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:27.940> he's<00:03:28.450> charts<00:03:29.260> area

well<00:04:48.800> then<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.940> know<00:04:50.090> i<00:04:50.389> can<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:50.960> keep

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
well then you know i can just keep

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.270 
well then you know i can just keep
stalling<00:04:51.380> this<00:04:51.590> thing<00:04:51.770> out<00:04:51.919> and<00:04:52.040> kill<00:04:52.160> it

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.850 
stalling this thing out and kill it
eventually<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.570> i'm<00:04:53.870> fairly<00:04:54.229> certain<00:04:54.410> i<00:04:54.740> need

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
eventually and i'm fairly certain i need

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.409 
eventually and i'm fairly certain i need
that<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:55.040> sucker<00:04:55.250> punch<00:04:55.430> PP<00:04:55.789> by<00:04:55.910> now<00:04:56.060> or<00:04:56.300> he's

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
that a sucker punch PP by now or he's

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.760 
that a sucker punch PP by now or he's
not<00:04:56.539> just<00:04:56.690> gonna<00:04:56.810> go<00:04:56.990> for<00:04:57.020> FC<00:04:57.410> nails<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.740> i

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
not just gonna go for FC nails and i

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.010 
not just gonna go for FC nails and i
probably<00:04:57.889> icon<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.220> attack<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.270> i<00:04:59.479> decided<00:04:59.960> to

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
probably icon to attack so i decided to

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.409 
probably icon to attack so i decided to
just<00:05:00.200> let<00:05:00.919> him<00:05:00.950> die<00:05:01.220> from<00:05:01.430> toxic<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.060> night

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
just let him die from toxic and night

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.969 
just let him die from toxic and night
goes<00:05:02.570> up<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.750> his<00:05:02.840> last<00:05:03.020> was<00:05:03.320> sleeping<00:05:03.590> Macario

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
goes up to his last was sleeping Macario

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.950 
goes up to his last was sleeping Macario
and<00:05:04.729> i<00:05:04.820> figure<00:05:05.120> i<00:05:05.180> can<00:05:05.270> just<00:05:05.539> keep<00:05:05.690> stalling

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
and i figure i can just keep stalling

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.620 
and i figure i can just keep stalling
until<00:05:06.229> it<00:05:06.410> dies<00:05:06.620> because<00:05:07.039> you<00:05:08.030> know<00:05:08.150> Lucario

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
until it dies because you know Lucario

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.990 
until it dies because you know Lucario
is<00:05:08.840> good<00:05:09.169> but<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:10.100> isn't<00:05:10.340> able<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:10.820> take
