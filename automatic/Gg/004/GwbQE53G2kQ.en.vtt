straight<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.290> fullscreen<00:03:49.830> okay<00:03:50.830> but<00:03:51.220> if<00:03:51.340> you

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
straight to fullscreen okay but if you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.620 
straight to fullscreen okay but if you
do<00:03:51.550> this<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:54.010> were<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.340> go<00:03:54.970> back<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.510> will

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
do this and you were to go back you will

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.510 
do this and you were to go back you will
see<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:55.930> actually<00:03:56.350> runs<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.010> video<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:57.400> the
