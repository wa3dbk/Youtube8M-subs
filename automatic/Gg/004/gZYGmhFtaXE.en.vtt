00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:09.040
 hello good morning let's start with 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.730
 some meatballs typical of mallorca 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.910
 and the ingredients are good you can 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.760
 do these answered in summer roast 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.710
 to the gardener and I'll explain everything 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.380
 what good pork and beef 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.489
 veal the two meats are separated 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.239
 but here 200 grams will be mixed 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:38.440
 of sobrasada 100 grams of see 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.670
 complicated purple 2 eggs salt pepper 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 and nutmeg 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.360
 we put cows here 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 for me 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.800
 we can spend not much because the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.480
 sobrasada has salt and the b contains 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.720
 let's shine it's not like that 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.150
 we put the pepper 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.240
 have the flavor 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.240
 and then to nutmeg 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.490
 Well now let's put the marjoram 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 at higher risk we call purple but 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.690
 you think the most improved already 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.580
 is now we put the sobrasada 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.020
 you see 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 we put the bacon 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.810
 the eggs 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.000
 and now you have to have fun kneading 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.780
 it's like that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 so they fall apart married basso because 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.170
 if we do not put our hands the works of 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.619
 bacon I have not turned out well 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.870
 we would be sobrasada one place and with another 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.890
 from the afternoon to another and there's more to something 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.319
 well how was sobrasada passed 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.810
 well let's start with the meatballs 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.660
 they are already aligned 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.350
 and you advance we passed by the girl equally 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.800
 we have 21 doubts fried there's good 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.770
 option that if for example in summer 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.510
 you do not want to go lay eggs you can put 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.810
 flour or a little bit of nothing 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.379
 and curd as with the egg as the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.150
 mayonnaise with milk also tastes very good 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:51.269
 that mayonnaise with milk is more let's 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.690
 to start with the aquariums if you have 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.610
 a little thing like that, little redondito that no longer 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.170
 you see concrete 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 we have with flour 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.870
 yes 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.300
 we take them we put them of the conclave 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.000
 when we have all we read them 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.810
 we passed with the pan with oil 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.660
 olive and let's see good as you can 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.510
 see the meatballs are done 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.500
 let's ask them 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.500
 it's a little bit 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.629
 dead prawn 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.510
 you do not have to stay anymore cried 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.459
 of a passage because the eyes remain 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.010
 here meters 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.950
 well here we have the flags already 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.400
 passed through the oil and we finished 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.950
 cut then we start from another point a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.140
 new oil that is left over we removed a 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.140
 little bit because I find there is a lot 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.700
 it's like that a little bit I already have more than 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.069
 I'm going to the inn and we're going to throw the onion 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.069
 and now deportation ends 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.440
 we can already throw the tomato with work 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.350
 roll a love is already cut off 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.730
 tomato 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.730
 now that you think 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.509
 Tomato the bunch of largest capture 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.720
 yes 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.720
 let's go now putting a little salt 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.800
 and pepper 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.310
 it's like that 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.310
 and a little bit of nothing 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.080
 and now to jose la salsita until he's 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.870
 at your point to throw in here good 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.860
 we already have the little eyes made more by quoting 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:22.750
 this time and now let's throw it here 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.470
 inside and now they have to sew the 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.470
 students 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.350
 now we will throw the water if it has field 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.720
 with the field if you do not have water broth 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.720
 example here you see 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.410
 There are 800 grams of water 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.410
 and now let's put the fire 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.639
 yes 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.650
 and we are going to be 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:58.320
 they are cooked have to look at controlling 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.180
 so it does not stick 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.520
 we will put them this way controlled 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.520
 now we cover that bake 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.850
 well we throw the peas the 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.230
 Peas are raw but the rest 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.230
 it's a boil 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:26.040
 is the carrot is boiled because if 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:30.370
 it does not leave a very sweet taste here inside 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.740
 we throw more I call myself in summer ambÃ³n 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.920
 and the flower boxes 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.970
 is the color that has 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.790
 to the bowl of the planters and if you want it 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:47.650
 eat with white rice can also be 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:50.360
 eat now throw the beans 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:54.760
 they also have a tree and now here 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.760
 inside they are to finish concrete 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.020
 A) Yes 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.180
 and now a new tapadito concitarse to 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.930
 final when it was all stitched 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.870
 we will throw the almond bite with 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.320
 parsley and a teaspoon of cornstarch 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.750
 so that the thickest sauce is left 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.330
 well let's crush the almonds the 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.610
 parsley and a teaspoon of cornstarch 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.680
 this is so that the sauce stays more 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.680
 compact good 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.650
 we throw 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.910
 the cornstarch 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.490
 we passed and we 're going to take the dive 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.819
 above and you will see what color and will 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.819
 stay 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:52.730
 it has to boil and it 's all 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:55.540
 the support we are going to enter and you will see 

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.540
 what dish 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:03.049
 and this can be served with some potatoes 

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:03.049
 fried and if not with rice 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:09.340
 we already have the meatballs found 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.340
 point of being alive
