00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
I'm gonna redo them anyway and instead

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.010 
I'm gonna redo them anyway and instead
of<00:01:08.350> doing<00:01:08.590> each<00:01:09.190> pod<00:01:09.550> or<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:09.940> panel<00:01:10.210> separate

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
of doing each pod or a panel separate

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.950 
of doing each pod or a panel separate
with<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.740> mold<00:01:12.270> more<00:01:13.270> than<00:01:13.420> likely<00:01:13.570> just<00:01:13.690> gonna

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
with a mold more than likely just gonna

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.090 
with a mold more than likely just gonna
do<00:01:14.110> like<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.409> one-piece<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.400> whole<00:01:15.520> door

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100

there<00:01:50.080> too<00:01:50.290> like<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.890> said<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.220> does<00:01:51.370> look

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
there too like I said it does look

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.680 
there too like I said it does look
really<00:01:51.700> pink<00:01:52.000> here

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
really pink here

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.950 
really pink here
it<00:01:53.260> does<00:01:53.590> not<00:01:53.740> look<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.190> in<00:01:54.370> real<00:01:54.760> life

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it does not look like that in real life

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.250 
it does not look like that in real life
so<00:01:55.960> it's<00:01:56.230> definitely<00:01:57.100> not<00:01:57.220> think<00:01:58.170> got<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
so it's definitely not think got the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.510 
so it's definitely not think got the
stereo<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.650> decided<00:02:00.040> not<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.160> go<00:02:00.250> with<00:02:00.370> a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
stereo and decided not to go with a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.300 
stereo and decided not to go with a
double<00:02:00.670> din<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.510> I<00:02:01.900> got<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.320> single<00:02:02.860> din<00:02:03.010> in

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
double din so I got the single din in

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.020 
double din so I got the single din in
and<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:04.560> got<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.540> EQ<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:07.750> I'm<00:02:08.289> making<00:02:08.619> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and I got the EQ and I'm making a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.089 
and I got the EQ and I'm making a
faceplate<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.239> now<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.750> that'll<00:02:10.959> be<00:02:11.110> wrapped

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
faceplate for now and that'll be wrapped

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.350 
faceplate for now and that'll be wrapped
in<00:02:12.250> vinyl<00:02:13.590> also<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.890> switch<00:02:15.129> panel<00:02:15.400> done

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
in vinyl also got the switch panel done

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.740 
in vinyl also got the switch panel done
so<00:02:17.080> it'll<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.349> two<00:02:17.530> switches<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
so it'll be two switches and this is the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.470 
so it'll be two switches and this is the
gonna<00:02:20.410> be<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.769> base<00:02:20.920> knob<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:22.209> that'll

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.350 
be under the tray and I'll run the wires
up<00:02:29.500> through<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:30.280> hole<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.849> I<00:02:30.909> have<00:02:31.150> down<00:02:31.330> here

up through a hole that I have down here
and<00:02:32.200> then<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.580> then<00:02:33.700> pop<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> that's

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
and then and then pop that on so that's

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.000 
and then and then pop that on so that's
kind<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.240> in<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.050> interior

really<00:02:55.870> doesn't<00:02:56.110> look<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:59.129> that's<00:03:00.129> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
really doesn't look think that's the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.509 
really doesn't look think that's the
only<00:03:00.519> thing<00:03:00.700> I've<00:03:00.790> been<00:03:00.819> working<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:05.310> making<00:03:06.310> a

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
only thing I've been working on making a

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
only thing I've been working on making a
false<00:03:06.700> floor<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.629> think<00:03:10.629> I<00:03:10.870> said<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.590> before

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
false floor so I think I said it before

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.990 
false floor so I think I said it before
but<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:13.859> floor<00:03:14.859> that<00:03:15.040> came<00:03:15.220> with<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:15.519> had<00:03:15.940> a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
but the floor that came with this had a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.059 
but the floor that came with this had a
good<00:03:16.239> three<00:03:16.510> or<00:03:16.540> four<00:03:16.629> slip<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.349> each<00:03:17.470> side<00:03:17.769> and

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
good three or four slip on each side and

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.970 
good three or four slip on each side and
so<00:03:18.370> anyway<00:03:19.090> made<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.389> false<00:03:19.569> floor<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
so anyway made the false floor the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.830 
so anyway made the false floor the
battery<00:03:27.340> tray<00:03:27.639> so<00:03:27.940> that's<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.239> stock<00:03:28.480> battery

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.270 

board<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.349> it's<00:03:35.650> very<00:03:35.920> well<00:03:38.190> sturdy<00:03:39.190> enough

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
board but it's very well sturdy enough

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280 
board but it's very well sturdy enough
on<00:03:39.549> them<00:03:39.700> on<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.000> bottom<00:03:40.150> side<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.510> I'm<00:03:40.810> going

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
on them on the bottom side and I'm going

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.319 
on them on the bottom side and I'm going
to<00:03:41.319> end<00:03:41.500> up<00:03:41.590> fiberglassing<00:03:42.159> it<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:42.970> it's<00:03:43.090> it's

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
to end up fiberglassing it but it's it's

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.689 
to end up fiberglassing it but it's it's
very<00:03:43.449> very<00:03:44.160> sturdy<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:46.930> what<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.169> is<00:03:47.699> it

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
very very sturdy for what it is it

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.420 
very very sturdy for what it is it
honestly<00:03:50.040> didn't<00:03:51.040> feel<00:03:51.069> it<00:03:51.280> was<00:03:51.310> worth

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
honestly didn't feel it was worth

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.430 
honestly didn't feel it was worth

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
where the original piece would open up

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.710 
where the original piece would open up
but<00:04:11.859> I<00:04:12.069> was<00:04:12.220> taken<00:04:12.459> away<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.669> lot<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.090> space<00:04:13.419> so

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
line it just won't fit

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.960

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.310 
but I'll be covering the battery panel
but<00:05:16.120> that's<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.720> know<00:05:16.750> obviously<00:05:17.140> what<00:05:17.260> I

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
but that's you know obviously what I

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.340 
but that's you know obviously what I
don't<00:05:17.470> want<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:17.650> do<00:05:18.000> so<00:05:19.110> probably<00:05:20.110> just<00:05:20.170> go

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
don't want to do so probably just go

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.120 
don't want to do so probably just go
with<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:20.560> regular<00:05:21.060> Porter<00:05:22.060> fox<00:05:22.300> and<00:05:22.600> see<00:05:23.130> how

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
with a regular Porter fox and see how

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.060 
with a regular Porter fox and see how
that<00:05:24.460> can<00:05:24.550> be<00:05:24.700> on<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.970> -<00:05:25.240> Brutus<00:05:25.660> 15s<00:05:26.290> still

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
that can be on the - Brutus 15s still

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.480 
that can be on the - Brutus 15s still
going<00:05:27.340> for<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.840> for<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.930> budget<00:05:29.230> build<00:05:29.460> but<00:05:30.460> I

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
going for the for the budget build but I

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.180 
going for the for the budget build but I
actually<00:05:30.640> purchased<00:05:31.180> two<00:05:31.360> 18<00:05:31.720> today<00:05:32.190> that

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
actually purchased two 18 today that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.020 
actually purchased two 18 today that
once<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:35.380> Brutus<00:05:35.710> is<00:05:35.830> died<00:05:36.040> or<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.310> get<00:05:36.550> tired

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
once the Brutus is died or I get tired

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.150 
once the Brutus is died or I get tired
of<00:05:37.150> them<00:05:37.300> or<00:05:37.390> whatever<00:05:37.600> I<00:05:37.960> will<00:05:38.650> be<00:05:38.800> building<00:05:39.070> a

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
of them or whatever I will be building a

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.840 
of them or whatever I will be building a
wall<00:05:39.310> with<00:05:39.940> two<00:05:40.060> 18s<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:41.590> guess<00:05:42.430> see<00:05:42.610> pillar

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
wall with two 18s I guess see pillar

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.260 
wall with two 18s I guess see pillar
behind<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.810> seats<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:45.000> that's<00:05:46.000> enough<00:05:46.210> for

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
behind the seats so that's enough for

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.480 
behind the seats so that's enough for
now<00:05:47.310> update<00:05:48.310> but<00:05:48.550> got<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:48.910> lot<00:05:49.090> of<00:05:49.180> work<00:05:49.300> done
