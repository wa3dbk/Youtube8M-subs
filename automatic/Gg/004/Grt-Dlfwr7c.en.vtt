the black arrows are pointing to SAP
these<00:00:05.120> are<00:00:05.390> two<00:00:05.750> by<00:00:05.900> twelve<00:00:06.259> douglas-fir<00:00:07.959> and

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:08.959 
these are two by twelve douglas-fir and

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.449 
these are two by twelve douglas-fir and
I<00:00:09.049> believe<00:00:09.289> they're<00:00:09.499> eight<00:00:09.650> footers<00:00:10.099> I<00:00:10.309> was

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459

I believe they're eight footers I was
using<00:00:10.700> them<00:00:10.969> for<00:00:11.089> some<00:00:11.509> stair<00:00:11.809> stringers<00:00:12.320> and

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
using them for some stair stringers and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.480 
using them for some stair stringers and
I<00:00:13.249> just<00:00:13.519> wanted<00:00:13.849> to<00:00:14.499> show<00:00:15.499> you<00:00:15.530> guys<00:00:15.799> in<00:00:16.280> case

now<00:00:19.519> the<00:00:19.580> arrows<00:00:20.300> are<00:00:20.630> actually<00:00:21.109> pointing<00:00:21.619> to

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.089 
now the arrows are actually pointing to

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.970 
now the arrows are actually pointing to
small<00:00:23.089> cracks<00:00:23.689> that<00:00:24.439> are<00:00:24.830> in<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.210> board

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980

hopefully you can see that I will zoom
in<00:00:29.749> to<00:00:30.199> see<00:00:30.230> probably<00:00:30.679> provide<00:00:31.039> you<00:00:31.160> guys<00:00:31.339> with

in to see probably provide you guys with
a<00:00:31.579> better<00:00:31.820> picture<00:00:32.150> but<00:00:32.990> if<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.290> ever<00:00:33.440> see

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
a better picture but if you ever see

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.970 
a better picture but if you ever see
something<00:00:34.010> like<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:35.050> then<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:36.080> will<00:00:36.800> know

something like this then you will know
what<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.490> now<00:00:37.850> SAP<00:00:38.540> will<00:00:38.930> create<00:00:39.290> problems

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
what it is now SAP will create problems

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.550 
what it is now SAP will create problems
sometimes<00:00:40.340> when<00:00:40.850> you're<00:00:41.000> painting<00:00:41.560> so

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
sometimes when you're painting so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.380 
sometimes when you're painting so
wouldn't<00:00:43.070> be<00:00:43.130> a<00:00:43.160> bad<00:00:43.370> idea<00:00:43.400> to<00:00:43.910> grab<00:00:44.090> some

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
wouldn't be a bad idea to grab some

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.150 
wouldn't be a bad idea to grab some
acetone<00:00:45.050> or<00:00:45.380> some<00:00:45.950> type<00:00:46.160> of<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:47.800> cleaner<00:00:48.800> and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
acetone or some type of a cleaner and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.550 
acetone or some type of a cleaner and
clean<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.880> SAP<00:00:50.120> off<00:00:50.360> before<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.020> do<00:00:51.230> paint

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
clean the SAP off before you do paint

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.820 
clean the SAP off before you do paint
sandpaper<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:52.870> might<00:00:53.870> not<00:00:54.110> do<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.380> job<00:00:54.560> a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
sandpaper that might not do the job a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.560 
sandpaper that might not do the job a
lot<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.370> times<00:00:55.580> you're<00:00:55.790> going<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.150> use

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
lot of times you're going to use

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.140 
lot of times you're going to use
sandpaper<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.470> SAP<00:00:58.310> you're<00:00:58.550> basically<00:00:58.940> going

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
sandpaper and SAP you're basically going

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.300 
sandpaper and SAP you're basically going
to<00:00:59.210> gum<00:00:59.450> the<00:00:59.630> sandpaper<00:01:00.140> up<00:01:00.560> and<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.190> might

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
to gum the sandpaper up and it might

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.810 
to gum the sandpaper up and it might
take<00:01:01.490> a<00:01:01.550> few<00:01:02.650> sheets<00:01:03.650> of<00:01:03.830> sandpaper<00:01:04.129> before

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
take a few sheets of sandpaper before

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.060 
take a few sheets of sandpaper before
you<00:01:04.940> actually<00:01:05.239> get<00:01:05.630> all<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.050> SAP<00:01:06.320> off<00:01:06.590> and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
you actually get all the SAP off and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.060 
you actually get all the SAP off and
even<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.030> do<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:09.050> might<00:01:09.290> not<00:01:09.530> get<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:09.920> all

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
even if you do you might not get it all

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.060 
even if you do you might not get it all
off<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.700> good<00:01:11.390> good

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
off so a good good

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.760 
off so a good good
you<00:01:13.820> know<00:01:13.940> glue<00:01:14.480> remover<00:01:15.110> something<00:01:15.620> like

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
you know glue remover something like

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.120 
you know glue remover something like
that<00:01:16.040> would<00:01:16.370> work<00:01:16.640> great<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:18.140> there<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.100> have

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
that would work great so there you have

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.780 
that would work great so there you have
it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.710 
it
