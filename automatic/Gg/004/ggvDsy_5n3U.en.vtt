fuck this analogy through that kind of
us<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.370> too<00:04:00.870> mMmmm<00:04:01.870> when<00:04:02.140> we<00:04:02.260> first<00:04:02.500> came<00:04:02.709> when

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
us is too mMmmm when we first came when

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.350 
us is too mMmmm when we first came when
we<00:04:03.190> start<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.520> game<00:04:03.730> you're<00:04:04.000> gonna<00:04:04.060> auto

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
we start to game you're gonna auto

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.840 
we start to game you're gonna auto
assign<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.160> whatever<00:04:06.160> side<00:04:06.459> of<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.670> tube

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
assign and whatever side of the tube

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.520 
assign and whatever side of the tube
useful<00:04:07.239> on<00:04:07.360> it's<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> be<00:04:08.050> your<00:04:08.260> side

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
useful on it's going to be your side

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.170 
useful on it's going to be your side
that's<00:04:08.800> your<00:04:08.950> base<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.580> never<00:04:09.730> changes

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
that's your base and it never changes

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.060 
that's your base and it never changes
strikes<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:11.200> can't<00:04:11.470> leave<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:11.890> base

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
strikes you you can't leave that base

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.040 
strikes you you can't leave that base
you<00:04:12.310> can<00:04:12.489> push<00:04:12.700> through<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.000> tube<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.720> still

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
you can push through the tube it still

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.960 
you can push through the tube it still
confirm<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.310> other<00:04:15.459> team's<00:04:15.670> gonna<00:04:15.790> be<00:04:15.880> on

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
confirm so the other team's gonna be on

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.190 
confirm so the other team's gonna be on
the<00:04:16.060> other<00:04:16.150> side<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.750> they're<00:04:16.989> gonna<00:04:17.079> be

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
the other side and they're gonna be

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.050 
the other side and they're gonna be
pushing<00:04:17.350> some<00:04:17.590> students<00:04:17.950> taking<00:04:18.609> out<00:04:18.760> only
