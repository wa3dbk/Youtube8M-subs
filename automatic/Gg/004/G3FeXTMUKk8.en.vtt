the<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:36.700> looking<00:01:37.700> after<00:01:37.850> them<00:01:38.179> then<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.720> think

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
the of looking after them then I think

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.080 
the of looking after them then I think
there<00:01:39.500> has<00:01:39.679> to<00:01:39.710> be<00:01:39.890> an<00:01:40.070> end<00:01:40.220> game<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:40.850> end

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
there has to be an end game and that end

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.389 
there has to be an end game and that end
game<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:41.450> me<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.659> where<00:01:42.500> possible<00:01:42.979> finding

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
game for me is where possible finding

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.770 
game for me is where possible finding
ways<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.820> can<00:01:44.000> reintroduce<00:01:44.270> them<00:01:44.630> back
