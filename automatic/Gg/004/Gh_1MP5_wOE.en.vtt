00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
really happened and then I that's when I

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.130 
really happened and then I that's when I
kind<00:00:22.000> of<00:00:22.090> went<00:00:22.210> oh<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.490> really<00:00:24.699> just<00:00:25.140> let

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
kind of went oh this is really just let

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.870 
kind of went oh this is really just let
me<00:00:26.230> think<00:00:26.260> about<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:26.650> for<00:00:26.800> a<00:00:26.980> second<00:00:27.310> but<00:00:27.699> by

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
me think about this for a second but by

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.460 
me think about this for a second but by
that<00:00:28.029> point<00:00:28.090> it<00:00:28.359> was<00:00:28.420> too<00:00:28.570> late<00:00:28.689> already<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.230> was

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
that point it was too late already I was

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.349 
that point it was too late already I was
already<00:00:29.590> in<00:00:29.740> New<00:00:29.890> York<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.400> she<00:00:30.609> was<00:00:30.760> to<00:00:31.060> lose

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
already in New York and she was to lose

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.970 
already in New York and she was to lose
too<00:00:31.689> late

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.490 

no<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.730> thing<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.970> loved<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.500> this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
no one thing I loved about this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
no one thing I loved about this
character<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:39.890> her<00:00:40.890> relationship<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.820> her

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
character was her relationship to her

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.110 
character was her relationship to her
family<00:00:42.770> for<00:00:43.770> me<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.220> think<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.640> every

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
family for me I think you know every

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.760 
family for me I think you know every
actor<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.440> different

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
actor you want to do different

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.900 
actor you want to do different
characters<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.309> different<00:00:47.520> roles<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
characters in different roles and this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
characters in different roles and this
is<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> role<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> haven't<00:00:48.750> done<00:00:48.870> before<00:00:49.020> but

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is a role I haven't done before but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900 
is a role I haven't done before but
there<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.890> similarity<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.640> our<00:00:50.790> brain

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
there is one similarity that our brain

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.520 
there is one similarity that our brain
to<00:00:51.030> every<00:00:51.360> rule<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.110> choice<00:00:52.350> as

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to every rule that's just my choice as

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
to every rule that's just my choice as
an<00:00:52.620> actress<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.030> portray

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
an actress and how I want to portray

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.420 
an actress and how I want to portray
female<00:00:55.230> characters<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> strength

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
female characters and that's a strength

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.100 
female characters and that's a strength
but<00:00:56.940> strength<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> me<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.750> comes<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.080> different

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
but strength to me it comes in different

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.700 
but strength to me it comes in different
ways<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:59.330> in<00:01:00.330> some<00:01:00.839> strengths<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.290> can't<00:01:01.500> see

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
ways and in some strengths you can't see

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.369 
ways and in some strengths you can't see
and<00:01:01.890> some<00:01:02.100> some<00:01:02.640> strength<00:01:02.910> isn't<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.480> isn't

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and some some strength isn't just isn't

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
and some some strength isn't just isn't
brute<00:01:04.739> force<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> think

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
brute force and it just and some I think

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770 
brute force and it just and some I think
sometimes<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.649> Jen<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.630> one<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
sometimes and with Jen the one of the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.820 
sometimes and with Jen the one of the
hardest<00:01:10.140> strengths<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.649> is<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
hardest strengths to have is is is is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.050 
hardest strengths to have is is is is
just<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:15.050> hold<00:01:16.050> back<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.649> just<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.580> love
