00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.049
 good we go immediately to the text 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.330
 biblical because apparently god does not 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.060
 he only uses technology but 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.060
 nuclear weapons we are seeing nuclear and 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.230
 no sir we are in genesis that 2019 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.570
 verse 24 28 ya see and their young 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.869
 a lot of attention with the data on 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.999
 Sodom and Gomorrah Sulfur and Fire from the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.800
 sky ok 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.140
 destroyed those cities to all 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.039
 inhabitants of cities and even 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.350
 soil plants plus women of the 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.059
 that was the only one that survived 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.030
 order of the angels who rescued him 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.010
 looked back since it was forbidden 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.590
 look when you study the cities and you 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.230
 turned into salt statue rose 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.570
 open tomorrow and it was the place where 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.390
 had been in front of key he looked towards 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.390
 sodoma and gomorra and saw that of that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.329
 land attention as it was now that it 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.490
 allowed them to watch smoke rose as the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.530
 smoke of a 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.200
 why not please I want that immediately 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.090
 give me a characteristic photo and 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.520
 tell me if what you are writing there 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.310
 obviously in that alien passage is if not 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.710
 it's the following rain 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.750
 when you allow to see when you have the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 they are far enough says that it looks like 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.210
 one that ascends in a giant way like 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.820
 the smoke of a furnace 6 attention there is a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.070
 This is also not minor when 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.590
 angels because he tells you please 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.149
 god that does not destroy these cities that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 although they are full of corruption 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.409
 let's say and it's like the name tells them 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.210
 no problem if you are able to 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.679
 prove to fall on a couple of people 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.409
 like you in this city we do not destroy the 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.479
 city make a tour there was nobody 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.920
 and he says ok at the time of leaving 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.560
 because god goes the bottom of user 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.729
 but do not go back to look clear what is 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.229
 what is recommended as the tests 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.539
 nuclear that you have to use it with lens and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.549
 everything else in your century is based van 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.130
 running away away by the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.560
 long time and suddenly disobeys the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.330
 lot's woman who looks back and gets 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.909
 turns into a statue of salt 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.440
 they say the correct introduction and 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.330
 we are seeing the graph from a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.130
 player where it is booting 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.510
 he shares his family and the wife of 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.030
 behind that remains like a statue 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.670
 completely solidifies they say that the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 real direct translation of the Hebrew 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.890
 it's not that I look back wanted 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.110
 stay behind to contemplate better 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.330
 show 1 and see what you can do 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.130
 compare the following please that neither 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.840
 more or less because we say that this 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.370
 it can be nuclear personnel and there is a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.340
 example one of the victims of the bomb 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.560
 Nuclear shot in Nagasaki and Hiroshima 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.900
 is exactly someone who is burned by 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.550
 legal or just nuclear and obviously it remains 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.410
 for the destruction of the concrete of all 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.420
 the buildings look like 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.640
 salt statues when the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.709
 nuclear wind to run and you 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.920
 has obviously like this fish that ni 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.870
 You know today in my house along with which 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 until today they feel in 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.370
 minimal doses of radioactivity in these 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.560
 which is pure desert towns where 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.870
 is the technology after the pump 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.170
 nuclear in hiroshima it rains and rains 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.019
 black 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.310
 it rains acid and the people and people who 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.959
 they were there damaged with the bomb 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.090
 they thought they were going to save themselves and they start 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.069
 to take that blue water and this water was 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.230
 contaminated and then die 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.700
 later as you well say and that 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.510
 it is not the perfect description of a 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.060
 nuclear attack 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.590
 whose tests to date are 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.409
 continue to perceive with instruments of 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.360
 geiger counters in my opinion can that 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.450
 this is not about denying God 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.670
 clearly exists but apparently there 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.069
 other figures or other beings that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.750
 they intervened and helped us other times 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.739
 guided us in the culture of 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.739
 human civilization
