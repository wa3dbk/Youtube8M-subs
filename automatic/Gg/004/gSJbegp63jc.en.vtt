00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and certainly the heavy situation 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.810
 economic that ours is experiencing 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.630
 country can also be seized in a 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.849
 curious indicator you see it on mine 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.269
 shoulders and that of a bicycle 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.550
 in fact according to the latest data in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.350
 Italy now sell more bicycles 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.900
 what cars 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:31.590
 testifies to this in this service 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:33.809
 laura will be those who go to work in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 only more bicycle produces 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.870
 the last of the studies that praise i 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 benefits of two-wheeled pedals 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 published by the prestigious magazine 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.140
 force in the UK have calculated 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879
 that an increase in the use of the bike 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.920
 could increase the productivity of the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.980
 work of 15 and a half billion euros 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 the equivalent of a corrective maneuver 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.250
 compared to those who do not use the bike i 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.199
 cyclist workers even have a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 absenteeism rate lower than 50 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.469
 percent 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 because cycling means 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.940
 first of all do physical activity 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.489
 mood improves memory and second 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.580
 some studies live on average two years 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.119
 more, in short, I lower the car and everyone into 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.610
 saddle 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.049
 two mayors have already done so 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 renzi and marine ignazio 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.860
 often and immortalized a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 walk on their own bikes 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 Florence has been a theater these days 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.680
 of world cycling welcomed 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 hundreds of runners but they are not 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.130
 lack of inconvenience to city traffic 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.140
 there are over 1,600,000 bikes sold in the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.150
 2012 down compared to the year 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.280
 previous due to the crisis but still 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.080
 more and more than one million and 400 cars 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.490
 thousand a figure that reflects the great 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.710
 vitality of the sector 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.930
 events like bike expo the most 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.550
 important in the national panorama that yes 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.740
 is recently held at the fair of 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.960
 padua show that interest in the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.910
 bicycle is increasingly widespread among 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.520
 curious and neophyte enthusiasts 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.750
 the army of pedals fans increases by 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.100
 year on year with fuel costs 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.990
 more and more Italians are 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.880
 choose the bicycle as a means of 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.460
 locomotion also to go to work 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.330
 according to the latest data at least 5 million 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.739
 of Italians have chosen the bicycle 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.090
 to the car carrying the army of gods 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.230
 aunt cycles a total of 14 million 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.970
 Italy remains the largest player 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.760
 European in terms of production 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.010
 assembly counting on companies 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.110
 they cycled on colnago bikes 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.180
 pope wojtyla rickman carlos and the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.980
 apple founder steve jobs that ne 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.980
 bought two directly at the factory 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.819
 I could tell by helicopter though not 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.480
 they had the basics of landing ours 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.000
 placed there landed altered thing to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.010
 born later but to be three 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200
 four hours you get story had to see 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.629
 our our shop ours 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 company is a crime in force on two measures 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.769
 for you one of the many but always home 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.129
 so many times so many 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.870
 oh people of any class I esteem 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.200
 the great little thefts I go to 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.200
 bicycle 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.760
 there really is something for everyone from 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.500
 old winery bikes revisited with 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.079
 a touch of elegance to the super 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.329
 even racing bikes from 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.970
 sand and snow also suitable 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.519
 for walks in the city and then misses 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.140
 in the bike electric bikes the folding 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.690
 more and more requests because easily 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.549
 transportable as luggage on trains and 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.709
 those with assisted pedaling 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.959
 still a niche product 20 thousand 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.819
 pieces sold per year but very practical 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.319
 especially in the city can autonomy 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.030
 vary depending on the level of 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.220
 required bicycle assistance 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 itself and there is the possibility of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.510
 select according to the model of 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.730
 bicycle between three or six different levels 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.040
 help from the engine e 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.139
 autonomy can vary from 40 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.180
 kilometers up to 120 depending on the 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.510
 model and type of use that 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.129
 we have with the bike 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.959
 but if on the one hand the offer increases 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.799
 product does not happen as much for the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.139
 infrastructure 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.870
 every euro invested in cycling and 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.370
 would return 5 to the community what 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.120
 administrations should do 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.760
 local cities are not equipped 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.920
 we say like our distant cousins â€‹â€‹of the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.579
 north so we don't have bike paths 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.019
 we have no parking areas 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.430
 dedicated to bicycles and then 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.259
 obviously what we say 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.150
 discourages the appliance from being used 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.190
 of the bike is really related to theft 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.740
 bicycle sex and its 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.650
 components in a system that still a 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.320
 services that can be useful for those 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.139
 use the bicycle then park 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.449
 then bike paths that can 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.729
 allow those who use the bicycle to 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:44.020
 go safely and we will take the path 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.389
 within the cities in Germany yes 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.940
 calculate about 42 thousand kilometers of 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.949
 17,000 bike paths in England 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.070
 while we hardly reach 3 thousand 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.449
 kilometers would at least serve others 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.550
 14 thousand the average cost of a track 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.770
 cycle path of 200 euros per meter 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.270
 or 3 billion euros total that 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.699
 would guarantee that development of the 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.530
 cycling tourism revenues of over 10 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.750
 billions if you think that in Germany 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.180
 there are seven million cyclists 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.310
 who spend on average 1,200 euros 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.710
 year if historical centers are excluded 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.810
 where cycling is more 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.330
 or less guaranteed for the majority of 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.370
 the cyclists are dangerous cities 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.710
 still few roads protected the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.110
 so-called zones 30 with a limit of 30 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.330
 kilometers per hour and bike paths 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.360
 traits mostly unrelated to each other 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.360
 and in some cases dilapidated and risky
