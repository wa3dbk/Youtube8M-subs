 For several weeks, Central Germany has a direct connection 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 to the Scottish metropolis Eppenberger three times a week a plane starts 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.099
 Erfurt is Altenburg 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.650
 now the Scottish slip airline is waiting with a very special one 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.900
 Action on 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.900
 which also benefits an exit for him 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.519
 The action is called Monster Wanted and leans against our new track in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.499
 Hattenburg 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.679
 we know the Loch Ness monster 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.499
 and to make people aware of this route will be on everyone's lips 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.890
 invited tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.670
 to get to Johannisplatz as if coming into a situation 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.180
 the first 50 who come and show us their monsters 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.160
 mother-in-law 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 but something else 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200
 "She finally knows a free flight to Heidelberg 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.950
 wanted is so that from Thuringia MS pull completely Una Monster 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.059
 History satisfied 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.299
 shows Ryanair about the air traffic from Thuringia 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.640
 Here, in addition to Altengrabow also London and Barcelona are served 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 around the nine cities now this year 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.240
 are very satisfactory have to hide with Barcelona Girona around long 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.170
 Already know passengers 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.260
 in the past summer months also busy 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.800
 are as in the past year 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.830
 changes in the new track comes after a wide further present so 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.350
 with that very clearly say that even this new track clubs for the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.640
 Summer months already very good before the outbreak of the 2 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.420
 however, the further expansion of the tried and tested Altenburg-nobitz is uncertain 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.759
 A new dispatch hall is planned alone the grant commitment of the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490
 Landes Thuringia is missing 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.930
 Ryanair also keeps up and this is quite common with theirs 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.840
 Announcement of new routes back No he is the only airline the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.450
 currently can continue to grow 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.020
 will continue to grow 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.860
 of course, mine wants to continue growing in Germany as well 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.110
 which airport will still be and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.360
 and when which routes will come to that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.660
 to discuss this at the moment still behind closed doors 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.630
 But the fact is smaller will continue to grow in Germany 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.430
 continue to grow 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 we see a giraffe and thus is as 1 percent 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.480
 still a very big potential 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.720
 for other lines are currently the chances for Altenburg rather bad 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.499
 after all 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.219
 airport taxes were abolished in Italy 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.470
