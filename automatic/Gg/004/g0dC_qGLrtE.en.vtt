00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.150
 welcome to my channel in the video of 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 today I'm going to make a simple recipe 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 of stewed pigeon peas 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.599
 if you want to see this recipe that is simple 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.179
 and a recipe for trouble sacks stay 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.420
 in tune with me to show you the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.090
 ingredients and the procedure 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.850
 although in the recipe we are going to need 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.860
 As I told you, a very simple recipe 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:42.290
 Simple pigeons can use them on 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.360
 serve and cook but that would be 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.850
 another recipe that I'm going to make 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.330
 using a 15 ounce lacquer of pigeon peas 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.930
 greens ok I'm using oil with 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.580
 achiote and this is optional if you do not 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.030
 they have or if they do not want to do it but in 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.920
 use a little oil an envelope of a 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.210
 seasoning with cilantro made from its 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.070
 preference 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.930
 here I have 2 tablespoons of zombie sauce 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.080
 and if they do not want to use the sofrito they can 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.510
 chop onion pepper etcetera et cetera 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.690
 etcetera here I have a teaspoon of 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.850
 garlic paste an 8-ounce can of 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.840
 ketchup 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.210
 a little bit of coriander and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.000
 here I have a small potato cut the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.520
 peeled washed and cut into pieces and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.170
 salt to taste I'm going to open this can and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.500
 we begin with the preparation of this 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.110
 recipe that is very simple 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.260
 what here I have a pot to which 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.260
 I put on medium high heat to heat 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.229
 I will look for water but slackers 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.689
 if you do not want you do not like that flavor 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 You can remove the water and wash it candú les 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.700
 I have done it before as well 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.979
 still has a little water so 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.960
 soon that water evaporates we're going to 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.939
 pour the oil with achiote and as I said 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.320
 if you have it, with luck you can 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.220
 add a little oil to 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.869
 sauté your vegetables 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.090
 ok i 'm going to start 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.090
 by the trickle of oil 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 I'm going to take the sofrito 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.970
 this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.870
 coriander 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.970
 and just like if you chopped onions 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.579
 pepper and you want to make your subscribed 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.260
 fresh with vegetable expert in the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.290
 problem 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.000
 you can do it like that and you're going to do this 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.590
 you will fry the same procedure 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.970
 little bit now we are going to throw him the pope 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.970
 From the can 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.569
 sauce 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.610
 we stir 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.690
 let's cook the sauce with the sauce 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.010
 for about a minute 2 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.290
 meanwhile he likes the envelope of 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.470
 seasoning with cilantro and achiote 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.470
 preference 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.090
 I'm going to take a little cumin 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.500
 and as I always say if you want it 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.940
 picosito you can take a chilito 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.940
 or cayenne pepper 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.329
 to then throw the pigeons with everything and 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.329
 22 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.110
 we miss the potato 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.100
 aa 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.440
 I'm going to give you a little bit of 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.440
 the slope is of sauce with water 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.389
 let's add salt to taste and I could 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.389
 be also pepper 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.750
 they throw salt and they steal 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.690
 I'm going to let it boil on fire 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.940
 medium high when it starts to boil what 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.490
 I'm going to lower to medium fire I'm going to 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.310
 put a lid but not completely 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.300
 covered and I'll let it cook 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.110
 for approximately 20 minutes 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.110
 okay 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.260
 bring it closer 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.840
 the final result of him 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.870
 they charge me their visas 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:09.050
 well it 's pesitos 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.050
 that you can serve it with white rice 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.220
 as I had left a cutlet 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.360
 chop piece a piece of chicken 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.360
 I made an arrogant 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.810
 I have a rosita here, almost up 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.320
 I have space but well there is a 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:31.460
 Chinese arrocito and then to serve with that 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.140
 because I'm not going to vote for food this way 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.820
 that you do not serve with what you 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.940
 want 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.820
 I 'm going to eat it now 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.220

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.430
