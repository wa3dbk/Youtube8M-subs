00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello i apologize dirty 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.080
 he is such a hard worker 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.630
 he never stands still means that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.810
 I would like to mention this means 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:25.109
 distance to the disk and the sight itself 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 the wheels should be the same as this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.219
 distance on that side 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 otherwise everything will be offset for what 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.070
 made this distance match 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.770
 assign i cut the frame see the frame 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.140
 cut and the same circle added on that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 the side that is tied here is the profile 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 here comes here tied this piece 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.539
 Profile well here so of course all 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:07.159
 sublevel all that was chiki-peaks means 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:10.200
 what next is he seeing these 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.119
 profile one fight that is from both 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.119
 solid here I added a little longer 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.400
 welded and here welded to the top 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.070
 at first was almost 4 millimeters 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 she gave a crack she and now I have her 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.729
 left it somewhere here now show here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.310
 visible and added on top means 8 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.030
 millimeter plate scalded together 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.549
 wall stand and we got here on 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.829
 this side in order to save 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:50.250
 Now the size of the wheels to the same 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.740
 so it was necessary from such a notch 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.619
 make you gram turned out 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.909
 goal on because here is open here this 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.149
 lord's plate 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.189
 on the other side of the wallpaper we are not laid then 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.649
 turns as if everything inside intact bolts 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.489
 through these two plates there plates 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.090
 four 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.670
 here you measures 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.790
 it means 12 millimeters thick 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.940
 This is all good yard on 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.190
 and here it is attached on one side with 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:30.180
 other side so for offset with 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.180
 the other side means 3 grams whole 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:40.080
 explaining in order to save here 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.519
 This distance from the injury is visible to the hand 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.450
 disk wheel show on everything was 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.910
 equally I had with that way 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.910
 obligations of the party see what 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.780
 handsome 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:01.349
 hunky when they are full but not 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.790
 today is not now and asked to show 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.290
 show me how I fixed it to the frame 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.480
 then this one hexagon 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.709
 hexagon should go parallel 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.239
 frame that is not parallel at an angle of 90 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.019
 degrees strictly that is by no means 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.510
 but breaking the angle of 90 degrees is good 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:31.049
 center the wheels that is so as not to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:35.530
 it was this movement 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.880
 he is at the differential hub see here 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.130
 there is nothing so complicated 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.180
 let's say they can make turner can 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.910
 make anyone near future i 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:57.450
 put the video on the differential floor 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:04:02.190
 but for now they shut up the system 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:11.209
 the order system has time the carriage is the same 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:11.209
 the most from see the same center 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:20.190
 central wheel that is this one 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.860
 This strip their center of the wheel 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.229
 must absolutely sleep in bed with this 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.229
 sides same story 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:42.510
 the distance is valid from the pendulum to the edge 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:47.100
 here to the edge like this should be 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.440
 the gap between the wheels is the same 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.290
 hoped to put the wings to nothing 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.780
 meaning unnecessary work nobody needs 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.080
 principle that on the engines now and you 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.180
 I'll take a closer look at how it is fixed 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.030
 Like all that to watch, then 4 bolts are good 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.070
 tightened 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:19.710
 1 2 it turns out the bottom plate 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:22.440
 here's the bottom you see there is a simple 4 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.800
 millimeter top 8 millimeters yourself 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:30.120
 it turns out 12 drilled through 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.360
 well yard on here are 1 2 sides same 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.160
 the thing here is all connected started to do on 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.150
 mating well and not to the body 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:48.090
 winter ahead still in front 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:50.599
 Basically everything I can say tract 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.599
 rec. 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:00.830
 mean more on the box here is the top 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:06.010
 bottom of the box ties them 4 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:09.830
 bolts for the tractor to move 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:13.160
 how would here speed back its bottom 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.030
 forward that is nitrate aroma god to 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:21.500
 put to put the seat that was 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:24.200
 convenient and put let's say that I am 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.870
 just turned just this 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.970
 I think you are all unwound and oil again 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:39.200
 bought 4 bolts and unwrapped 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:42.590
 this is now seen these here here here I 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:46.820
 turned 180 degrees on the mount 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:52.430
 all coincided and get growth and rides 2 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:57.830
 speed back here is one thing ahead how 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:02.150
 walker and as a tractor type 16 then 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:06.860
 there are vice versa 2 trailers forward and on 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:09.860
 Reverse back noise principle all motoblock 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:15.380
 the same remained nothing has changed 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.830
 no cows are not added and the pedal brought 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.910
 current 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:24.080
 grevus and grip from that side 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.080
 clutch also brought on this all here 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 you and the whole 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 tractor 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:38.229
 well, goodbye
