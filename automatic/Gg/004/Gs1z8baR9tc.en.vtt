00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.760 
right so I just got done using it the
soap<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.630> works<00:02:06.780> pretty<00:02:07.140> well

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
soap actually it works pretty well

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.479 
soap actually it works pretty well
smells<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:11.100> small<00:02:11.459> for

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
smells really nice it is a bit small for

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.940

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the price it is of 1099 but that's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.259 
the price it is of 1099 but that's
probably<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.670> supposed<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.060> come

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269
