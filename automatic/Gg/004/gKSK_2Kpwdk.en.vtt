protein<00:00:22.529> shake<00:00:22.800> simple<00:00:23.250> because<00:00:23.369> your<00:00:24.090> diet

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
protein shake simple because your diet

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.290 
protein shake simple because your diet
doesn't<00:00:25.109> consist<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.980> sufficient<00:00:26.580> protein<00:00:27.000> so

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
doesn't consist of sufficient protein so

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.419 
doesn't consist of sufficient protein so
protein<00:00:27.750> shake<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> must<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.890> want<00:00:29.130> nice

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429

shakes<00:00:32.969> isn't<00:00:33.300> all<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> easy<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
shakes isn't all that easy because you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.310 
shakes isn't all that easy because you
have<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> blender<00:00:35.850> add<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.960> milk

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
have to get the blender add the milk

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.860 
have to get the blender add the milk
then<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.370> add<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.969> protein<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
then you have to add the protein that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.340 
then you have to add the protein that
you<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.450> once<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.840> done<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.230> have

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you got and then once it's done you have

you got and then once it's done you have
to<00:00:43.469> clean<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> blender<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> very

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to clean the blender this is a very

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
to clean the blender this is a very
time-consuming<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> big<00:00:46.200> hassle<00:00:46.350> but

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
time-consuming it's a big hassle but

blender<00:00:50.640> bottle<00:00:50.820> these<00:00:51.420> bad<00:00:51.660> boys<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:52.140> great

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
blender bottle these bad boys are great

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
blender bottle these bad boys are great
because<00:00:53.250> unlike<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.660> blender<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.219> takes<00:00:56.910> less

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
because unlike the blender it takes less

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
because unlike the blender it takes less
than<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> minute<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.379> prepare<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.160> protein

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
than a minute to prepare your protein

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
than a minute to prepare your protein
shake<00:00:59.850> with<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.750> let<00:01:00.870> me<00:01:00.930> show<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.140> how

shake with this so let me show you how

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
shake with this so let me show you how
it<00:01:01.289> works<00:01:01.559> alright<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> way<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.370> blender

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it works alright so the way that blender

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.119 
it works alright so the way that blender
bottle<00:01:03.270> works<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:04.949> has<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bottle works is that actually has a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
bottle works is that actually has a
spring<00:01:05.939> inside<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> let<00:01:06.720> me<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.960> show<00:01:07.080> you

one here's what's gonna make your

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
one here's what's gonna make your
protein<00:01:33.299> shake<00:01:33.570> delicious<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> spring

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
protein shake delicious what this spring

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.819 
protein shake delicious what this spring
essentially<00:01:36.090> does<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.689> spins<00:01:37.110> around<00:01:37.290> inside

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
essentially does it spins around inside

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.940 
essentially does it spins around inside
the<00:01:37.950> bottle<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.840> much<00:01:39.930> blends<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the bottle and it pretty much blends the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.910 
the bottle and it pretty much blends the
protein<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> works<00:01:42.060> done<00:01:42.570> good<00:01:43.200> spring

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
protein and it works done good spring

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.539 
protein and it works done good spring
food<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.350> basically<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.860> add<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.340> milk

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
food so you basically just add your milk

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.990 
food so you basically just add your milk
or<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.850> water<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.509> protein<00:01:49.850> seal<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
or your water and your protein seal it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.859 
or your water and your protein seal it
up<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.470> shake<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.890> BAM

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.390 

not<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.680> guys<00:01:58.830> right<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.220> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this works much better than the blender

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219
