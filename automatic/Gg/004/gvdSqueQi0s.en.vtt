00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Good all day 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.790
 connecting the stepper motor to the axis at 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.880
 help module on pc f80 574 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.700
 about which I told in the past video 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.310
 here I own the module itself and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.539
 all arduins connected to this driver 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.830
 on l293d redone of bipolar this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 chinese stepper motor 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 I do not remember how it is called correctly 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.699
 and accordingly the code will be for 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.210
 bipolar engines then bershka 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 I mean, which works in four cycles 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.180
 by the way so this can be seen in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.250
 the st-pier library 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:46.230
 and so here it is but it looks like it is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.530
 the beginning of the winding is included in one 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.210
 direction with one polarity then on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.890
 one coil polarity is changing 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.309
 changing to another well and so actually 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.309
 round 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.859
 need these bits 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.390
 I think you need to first force the engine 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.149
 work only act than what will be needed 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.340
 make will need to make an array of 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.000
 four bytes in which will lie 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.759
 such here it is bits and we will send by 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.759
 Queue at the port under your 85 74 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.829
 and now you need these measures and in turn 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.829
 toss into the port 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.909
 controllable sense bytes 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.610
 you 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.830
 and waiting 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.170
 and seconds we load see what 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.170
 it turned out to be a mistake 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.079
 but to turn the other side you need 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.139
 just run this counter in reverse 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:19.010
 direction and I think the department is better 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.010
 arrange function 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.850
 function will be passed 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.110
 fat rate 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.319
 and the direction of rotation 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.520
 hung programs to record from the screen 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.150
 general this function is working 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.030
 the function comes the number of steps 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.410
 rotation speed and direction known 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.360
 if danits came here artur twist cycle 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.830
 specified number of steps in the loop body 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.540
 send to enter the port 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.870
 we are waiting for a certain amount 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:13.680
 milliseconds if came 0 let 's do everything 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.450
 the same is only turning the motor and cycle in 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.780
 the reverse direction in the loop is calling 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 this function 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.249
 Thank you all for your attention.
