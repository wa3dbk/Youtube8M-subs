00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.800
 they are at paul scherrer-institut despite red light source Switzerland 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.820
 the core of this world modern research facility forms a 280 meters 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 long annular electron accelerator 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.320
 inside the tunnel next to there by means of intense electrical and 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.650
 magnetic fields 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.830
 Accelerating electrons in a vacuum to almost the speed of light 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 The electrons pass through the three sections 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.050
 the linear accelerator the semifinals 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.260
 the boosters 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.270
 and finally the storage ring 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.980
 where they circle over a duration of up to 8 hours on average 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 The electrons can be obtained from an electron 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440
 from where they are on a straight line stretch the linear accelerator 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.249
 be accelerated to an energy of one hundred mega electron volts 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 From there, the electrons get into the booster 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.190
 this accelerated particle beams are in innumerable cycles within 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.560
 less seconds has her final cruising speed 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.820
 Schonach flows a billion kilometers per hour 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.469
 almost as fast as the light 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.659
 from the toaster, the electrons are then invested in the memory 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.919
 the most exciting 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.489
 a variety of periodically arranged technical equipment the multiple 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.809
 constant 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.529
 finally, the electrons are in a so-called and Ulla tour with 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.659
 Help strong permanent magnets 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.609
 pushed to a very tight slalom band 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.739
 The electrons are high-frequency electromagnetic waves 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.849
 that in Kyoto not 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.340
 This is not so far then can be at the core of the social performance in Spain 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.199
 also learned playfully 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.499
 used for research purposes 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.049
 while the electrons maintain their regular circle association 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.939
 In 2001, the SLS launched four strategies 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.049
 Today, this state-of-the-art facility operates 16 controversial lines around the clock 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.979
 and by 2010, it even ran 20 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 the specialist is called the world for research purposes 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.779
 AUD 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.539
 for the smooth running the security of the plant ensures 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.779
 control center 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.810
 which surveys and regulates all activities 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.070
 the construction and maintenance of sophisticated equipment 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.820
 are subject to their own department for large 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.000
 research facilities 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 in short, the EFTA 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.730
 Thus, the Paul Scherrer Institute secures scientists from Switzerland and Switzerland 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.689
 other countries 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.829
 one of the most modern ones is open research questions
