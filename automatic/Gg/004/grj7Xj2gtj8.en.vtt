00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
all taken and so these were the only got

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.290 
all taken and so these were the only got
one<00:03:12.489> choice<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:14.849> he's<00:03:15.849> going<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> go<00:03:16.239> here<00:03:18.300> and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
one choice and he's going to go here and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.610 
one choice and he's going to go here and
look<00:03:19.480> at<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.730> blind<00:03:22.030> finger<00:03:22.630> actually<00:03:23.140> here's

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
look at the blind finger actually here's

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.660 
look at the blind finger actually here's
one<00:03:23.920> by<00:03:24.340> getting<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.850> full<00:03:25.380> horizontal<00:03:26.380> line

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
one by getting a full horizontal line

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.960 
one by getting a full horizontal line
and<00:03:27.670> just<00:03:27.790> high<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.209> if<00:03:28.390> we<00:03:29.970> straight

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
and just high like if we straight

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.880 
and just high like if we straight
through<00:03:31.269> there<00:03:31.450> now<00:03:32.019> that's<00:03:32.230> with<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.440> blind

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
through there now that's with a blind

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.360 
through there now that's with a blind
finger<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.870> bandaid<00:03:35.560> on<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.830> it's<00:03:36.190> actually

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
finger the bandaid on it it's actually

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.509 
finger the bandaid on it it's actually
one<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:39.569> it's<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.870> IQ<00:03:41.650> right<00:03:41.830> touch<00:03:42.220> frame

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
one and so it's the IQ right touch frame

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.400 
one and so it's the IQ right touch frame
and<00:03:42.790> action<00:03:43.330> there<00:03:43.540> on<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:44.340> wall-mounted<00:03:45.340> LCD

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
and action there on a wall-mounted LCD

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.470 
and action there on a wall-mounted LCD
it's<00:03:47.410> approximately<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> 19<00:03:48.370> inch<00:03:48.489> monitor<00:03:49.030> and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
it's approximately a 19 inch monitor and

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.870 
it's approximately a 19 inch monitor and
can<00:03:49.720> go<00:03:49.900> right<00:03:50.170> up<00:03:50.349> to<00:03:50.380> 4<00:03:51.190> meters<00:03:51.519> whined<00:03:53.880> 200

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
can go right up to 4 meters whined 200

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.270 
can go right up to 4 meters whined 200
inches<00:03:55.030> diagonal<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.989> we<00:03:59.079> have<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.350> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
inches diagonal so here we have it the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.580 
inches diagonal so here we have it the
blind<00:04:00.609> finger<00:04:01.090> actually<00:04:01.660> won<00:04:01.840> over<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
blind finger actually won over the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.039 
blind finger actually won over the
finger<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.340> could<00:04:03.579> see<00:04:03.900> thanks<00:04:04.900> for

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
finger that could see thanks for

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.440 
finger that could see thanks for
