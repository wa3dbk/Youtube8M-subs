00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello guys today we are going to make torrijas 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.750
 with cinnamon and sugar for this we are going to 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.880
 divide the ingredients into two parts 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.490
 on the one hand the ingredients for the 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.090
 bread that are 410 grams of flour 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.699
 force 285 ml of milk 20 grams of 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.490
 fresh yeast zest of a lemon 10 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.420
 grams of sugar 10 grams of salt and 10 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 grams of molasses 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.619
 on the other hand the ingredients for the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.570
 torrijas are three parts of milk per 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.520
 one of white wine does not matter 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.949
 quantities the important thing is 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.390
 proportions we will also need 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.860
 three beaten eggs and sugar and cinnamon 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.449
 Now that we have it all, we are going to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.930
 start our recipe on the one hand 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.730
 we have the milk the molasses the sugar the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 lemon zest and salt 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.810
 to start we put the milk to heat 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.810
 and we are adding sugar 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.980
 the salt 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.980
 the lemon zest 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:23.619
 and the teaspoon of molasses 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:25.719
 and we remove it well and once 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.579
 hot but not boiling we remove it 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:33.990
 of the fire and we move it to the last step 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.990
 we add fresh yeast 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.050
 as you see it must be well dissolved 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.510
 we take the flour that we had prepared 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.510
 and we are going to add the previous mix 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.350
 what we have to do is remove it 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.450
 well if you have a rod blender 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.440
 will help you a lot since this mass is a 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.440
 little sticky 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.560
 once we see that the dough is good 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.170
 homogeneous we will let it rest 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:44.840
 for 30 minutes or until you double your 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:46.580
 volume as you can see it has already doubled its 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.730
 volume then what are we going to proceed 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.890
 is to shape it we are going to form a 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.140
 bread loaf each one that gives the form 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.880
 desired to bread since the final form of 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.739
 the torrija will depend on the way you 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.569
 you give time to bread 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.940
 to see our bread have already the form what 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.970
 let's stand for 30 minutes 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.530
 more after the 30 minutes we are going to 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.110
 proceed to cut the bread into slices 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:23.560
 everyone can cut it as they want to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:25.540
 thinner or thicker slices a 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.720
 Once we have it, we preheat the oven to 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.890
 200 degrees we 're going to leave about 20 or 30 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.540
 minutes until it's golden brown for 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.340
 know that our bread is already made 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.769
 let's tap the base 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.569
 if it sounds hollow it will be ready our 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.160
 bread and now that we have it, we are going to 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.440
 cut it into the slices we had 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.579
 marked to be preparing and the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.579
 slices well the torrijas 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.549
 as you can see the friend of the bread has 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:42.500
 been well compact this will help 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:44.810
 absorb more milk and we have here 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.250
 our bread slicing now 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.530
 let's start now to make our 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.539
 torrijas we are going to need an empty bowl 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.160
 to make the mixture and they are three parts 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.160
 of milk for one of white wine 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:37.280
 and we mix it well and we overturn it 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.470
 a deep dish to have more 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.470
 ease to bathe our slices 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.020
 Once we have it, we are going to start 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.250
 bathe our slices of bread in the 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.120
 mixture of milk and cinchona that we have 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.590
 prepared 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.300
 I recommend letting drain 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.300
 slices on a grid 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.169
 while it runs off in our 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.960
 slices let's beat 3 eggs 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.360
 once we have it, we will go bathing 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:54.509
 our slices in the beaten egg and 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:56.520
 We are going to leave them on a plate 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:00.800
 Once we have them all ready we heat 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.800
 olive oil and put them to fry 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.670
 when we have them ready the 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.160
 we will put on a plate with paper of 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:23.480
 cook so that it absorbs all the 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:26.000
 oil once we have them ready 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.150
 we will take sugar and cinnamon and proceed 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.150
 to sprinkle the this goes to taste 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:05.540
 and we have our torrijas ready 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:09.550
 remember that I have more recipes at www
