the<00:02:23.989> see<00:02:24.230> over<00:02:24.470> there<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.650> starting<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.430> look

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
the see over there is starting to look

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.370 
the see over there is starting to look
orange<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.630> think<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.930> might<00:02:27.080> be<00:02:27.200> due<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
orange we think that might be due to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.530 
orange we think that might be due to
rust<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.070> that's<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.060> kind<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.300> pollution

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
rust and that's the kind of pollution

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.630 
rust and that's the kind of pollution
that's<00:02:30.170> rather<00:02:30.410> more<00:02:30.620> difficult<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.459> deal

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that's rather more difficult to deal

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.810 
that's rather more difficult to deal
with<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.500> here<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.769> we<00:02:34.010> smelt<00:02:34.340> diesel

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
with it was here that we smelt diesel

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.050 
with it was here that we smelt diesel
and<00:02:34.970> spotted<00:02:35.780> an<00:02:35.900> oily<00:02:36.290> sheen<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.980> water

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
and spotted an oily sheen on the water

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.580 
and spotted an oily sheen on the water
from<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> air<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.690> clearly<00:02:39.110> see<00:02:39.230> where

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
from the air you can clearly see where

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.890 
from the air you can clearly see where
it's<00:02:39.709> come<00:02:39.980> from<00:02:40.010> two<00:02:40.790> cracks<00:02:41.209> which<00:02:41.660> may

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
it's come from two cracks which may

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.229 
it's come from two cracks which may
cause<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.440> vessel<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.890> break<00:02:43.130> up<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
cause the vessel to break up but the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.120 
cause the vessel to break up but the
Coast<00:02:44.450> Guard<00:02:44.750> says<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.230> double<00:02:45.590> hull<00:02:45.830> has

Coast Guard says that double hull has

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.009 
Coast Guard says that double hull has
not<00:02:46.370> been<00:02:46.640> breached<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.660> their<00:02:47.840> first

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
not been breached so their first

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.259 
not been breached so their first
priority<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.100> remove<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.790> three<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.209> a

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
damage isn't even a consideration and we

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.680 
damage isn't even a consideration and we

window of opportunity they have

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.729 
window of opportunity they have
basically<00:03:26.780> till<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.049> end<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.320> week

when the weather is expected to

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.210 
when the weather is expected to
deteriorate<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:30.019> try<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> get<00:03:30.560> all<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.980> oil

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
deteriorate to try to get all that oil

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.970 
deteriorate to try to get all that oil
hundreds<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.030> tons<00:03:32.329> of<00:03:32.510> oil<00:03:32.660> off<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.200> ship<00:03:33.769> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
hundreds of tons of oil off the ship and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.800 
hundreds of tons of oil off the ship and
try<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.489> get<00:03:34.640> all<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.880> remaining<00:03:35.150> containers

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
try to get all the remaining containers

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.210 
try to get all the remaining containers
off<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.110> ship<00:03:36.320> because<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:36.680> they<00:03:36.769> can't<00:03:37.010> do

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
off the ship because if they can't do

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.949 
off the ship because if they can't do
that<00:03:37.370> by<00:03:37.519> Thursday<00:03:37.940> Friday<00:03:38.120> they<00:03:38.420> think<00:03:38.600> they

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
that by Thursday Friday they think they

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.660 
that by Thursday Friday they think they
could<00:03:39.019> be<00:03:39.170> big<00:03:39.500> environmental<00:03:39.980> problems<00:03:40.489> so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
could be big environmental problems so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.430 
could be big environmental problems so
they're<00:03:41.000> working<00:03:41.269> through<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.540> night<00:03:41.690> as<00:03:41.930> the
