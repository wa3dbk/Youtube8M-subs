transplanted<00:00:31.349> seedlings<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.880> we're<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
transplanted seedlings so we're going to

timba<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> he's<00:00:40.079> got<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> bowl<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.950> food<00:00:41.129> grade

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
timba and he's got a bowl of food grade

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
timba and he's got a bowl of food grade
diatomaceous<00:00:41.820> earth<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:44.420> he's<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
diatomaceous earth and he's going to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
diatomaceous earth and he's going to
he's<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> kill<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.219> bugs<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.030> we'd

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
he's going to kill the bugs with it we'd

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.910 
he's going to kill the bugs with it we'd
like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> kills<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> bugs

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
like this because it kills the bugs

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.910 
like this because it kills the bugs
through<00:00:50.370> injuring<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.410> instead<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> by

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
through injuring them instead of by

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
through injuring them instead of by
poisoning<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.850> when<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> poison<00:00:54.989> insects

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
poisoning them when you poison insects

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.819 
poisoning them when you poison insects
they<00:00:56.250> tend<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> build<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.239> resistance<00:00:57.829> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
they tend to build up a resistance to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.049 
they tend to build up a resistance to
that<00:00:59.399> poison<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.190> it's<00:01:02.190> hard<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> kill<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
that poison and it's hard to kill the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
that poison and it's hard to kill the
future<00:01:03.480> generations

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
future generations

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.250 
future generations
okay<00:01:05.640> Timbo<00:01:06.060> show<00:01:06.450> us<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
okay Timbo show us how you're going to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.969 
okay Timbo show us how you're going to
do<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.039 

we<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.610> timber<00:01:12.390> lifts<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> weeds

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
we know that when timber lifts the weeds

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.130 
we know that when timber lifts the weeds
the<00:01:13.380> bugs<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> roll<00:01:14.900> crawl<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the bugs are going to roll crawl out of

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.600 
the bugs are going to roll crawl out of
it<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.619> they're<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> try<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.400> back

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it and they're going to try and get back

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.350 
it and they're going to try and get back
into<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> soil<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.439> doing<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.799> border<00:01:20.360> so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
into the soil so we're doing a border so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.249 
into the soil so we're doing a border so
as<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.290> run<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.990> try<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> get

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
as they as they run out and try to get

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
as they as they run out and try to get
back<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> garden<00:01:26.220> they'll<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> run

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
back into the garden they'll have to run

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.319 
back into the garden they'll have to run
through<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> de<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.369> it'll

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
through the de and when they do it'll

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
through the de and when they do it'll
get<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.750> their<00:01:30.930> bodies<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.409> it'll<00:01:31.890> cut<00:01:32.130> them

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
get on their bodies and it'll cut them

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.160 
get on their bodies and it'll cut them
if<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.390> doesn't<00:01:33.840> cut<00:01:34.079> them<00:01:34.350> don't<00:01:35.310> lick<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.520> off

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
if it doesn't cut them don't lick it off

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.910 
if it doesn't cut them don't lick it off
if<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.560> tongues<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.710> when<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.860> do

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
if they have tongues and when they do

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
if they have tongues and when they do
and<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.850> ingest<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.509> it'll<00:01:42.780> cut<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.290> in

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and they ingest it it'll cut them up in

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.639 
and they ingest it it'll cut them up in
the<00:01:43.560> inside<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> they'll<00:01:44.430> die<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.350> there

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the inside and they'll die and if there

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.789 
the inside and they'll die and if there
are<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:47.610> their<00:01:47.939> babies<00:01:48.390> eat<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.960> back<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
are if their babies eat them back at the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
are if their babies eat them back at the
nest<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.670> back<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> nest

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
nest if they make it back to the nest

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.800 
nest if they make it back to the nest
the<00:01:52.049> babies<00:01:52.409> will<00:01:52.590> die<00:01:52.619> too<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the babies will die too so we think this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
the babies will die too so we think this
is<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> cool<00:01:55.290> insect<00:01:55.860> killer<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.060> he<00:01:57.119> gets

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
is a cool insect killer now when he gets

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.209 
is a cool insect killer now when he gets
that<00:01:57.509> sprinkled<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.229> top<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> weeds

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that sprinkled on the top of the weeds

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.889 
that sprinkled on the top of the weeds
he's<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> shake<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.509> bit

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
he's just going to shake it a little bit

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.350 
he's just going to shake it a little bit
distribute<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> de<00:02:01.920> through<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> weeds<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
distribute the de through the weeds and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.230 
distribute the de through the weeds and
then<00:02:04.350> he's<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> carefully<00:02:05.130> pick<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.909> the

to kill them we're circling the plant

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.940 
to kill them we're circling the plant
with<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> dry<00:03:40.890> de<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:42.110> then<00:03:43.110> timber<00:03:43.770> will

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
with the dry de and then timber will

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.930 
with the dry de and then timber will
lift<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.310> plant<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:46.310> blast<00:03:47.310> them<00:03:47.640> with<00:03:47.670> the

lift the plant and blast them with the
dry<00:03:48.180> de<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:49.020> scamper<00:03:49.739> away<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> very

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
dry de is a scamper away this is a very

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.860 
dry de is a scamper away this is a very
good<00:03:53.550> way<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.850> kill<00:03:54.360> squash<00:03:54.780> bugs<00:03:56.510> some<00:03:57.510> people

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
good way to kill squash bugs some people

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.410 
good way to kill squash bugs some people
will<00:03:58.050> use<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.230> board<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.610> pin<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> squash

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
will use a board and the pin the squash

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.240 
will use a board and the pin the squash
bugs<00:04:00.750> will<00:04:00.959> crawl<00:04:01.200> under<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.650> board<00:04:01.920> but<00:04:02.130> when

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
bugs will crawl under the board but when

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.030 
bugs will crawl under the board but when
you<00:04:02.370> lift<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.730> board<00:04:03.060> they<00:04:03.300> tend<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.630> run<00:04:04.040> so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
you lift the board they tend to run so

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.699 
you lift the board they tend to run so
the<00:04:05.610> de<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.510> board<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.930> good<00:04:07.170> way<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.380> go

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the de and the board is a good way to go

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.290 
the de and the board is a good way to go
if<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.250> don't<00:04:08.400> have<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> board<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.600> works<00:04:09.989> too

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.979 

it's<00:04:14.660> important<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.230> remember<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.800> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
it's important to remember that the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.960 
it's important to remember that the
