hall opens at 6:00 in the morning and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.950 
hall opens at 6:00 in the morning and
the<00:01:58.530> show<00:01:58.710> starts<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:59.189> 7:00<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.750> you're

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the show starts at 7:00 and if you're

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
the show starts at 7:00 and if you're
doing<00:02:01.049> collector<00:02:01.500> class<00:02:01.680> entries<00:02:02.070> you're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
doing collector class entries you're

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.770 
doing collector class entries you're
setting<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:02.969> 6:00<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.390> got<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> get

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
setting that up at 6:00 you got to get

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.030 
setting that up at 6:00 you got to get
at<00:02:03.899> least<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> rest<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
at least a little bit of rest because it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.760 
at least a little bit of rest because it
is<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> long-ass<00:02:06.119> day<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.960> starts<00:02:07.259> really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
is a long-ass day and it starts really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.199 
is a long-ass day and it starts really
early<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.399> you're<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> morning<00:02:09.060> person

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
early and if you're not a morning person

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.559 
early and if you're not a morning person
just<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.959> am<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:11.160> hard<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.300> be

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
just like I am it's hard so just be

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
just like I am it's hard so just be
aware<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
aware of that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
aware of that
ii<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> divisions<00:02:15.540> run

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
ii know that all the divisions run

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.630 
ii know that all the divisions run
concurrently<00:02:16.350> there's<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.890> lot<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.250> divisions

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
concurrently there's a lot of divisions

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.130 
concurrently there's a lot of divisions
not<00:02:18.120> counting<00:02:18.450> performance<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.050> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
not counting performance in the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.560 
not counting performance in the
collectors<00:02:19.530> class<00:02:19.770> let's<00:02:20.160> see<00:02:20.360> regular<00:02:21.360> runs

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
collectors class let's see regular runs

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.860 
collectors class let's see regular runs
special<00:02:22.110> run<00:02:22.290> collectability<00:02:23.250> minis<00:02:24.120> customs

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
special run collectability minis customs

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.290 
special run collectability minis customs
so<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:25.710> five<00:02:26.130> different<00:02:26.490> sections<00:02:26.850> all

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
so that's five different sections all

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300 
so that's five different sections all
running<00:02:27.690> concurrently<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.070> believe

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
running concurrently and then I believe

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.950 
running concurrently and then I believe
there's<00:02:29.490> three<00:02:29.700> performance<00:02:30.240> sections<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
there's three performance sections and

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.530 
there's three performance sections and
also<00:02:31.140> three<00:02:31.740> collectors<00:02:32.520> class<00:02:32.730> divisions<00:02:33.240> so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
also three collectors class divisions so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.330 
also three collectors class divisions so
obviously<00:02:33.960> there's<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.290> lot<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.740> stuff<00:02:34.980> going

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
obviously there's a lot of stuff going

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.490 
obviously there's a lot of stuff going
on<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.790> with<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:37.050> important

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
on and with that it's really important

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.320 
on and with that it's really important
to<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.650> organized<00:02:38.130> listen<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> class

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
to be organized listen to the class

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.900 
to be organized listen to the class
calls<00:02:39.600> as<00:02:39.750> best<00:02:40.020> as<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.440> cuz<00:02:41.310> they<00:02:41.880> are

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
calls as best as you can cuz they are

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.640 
calls as best as you can cuz they are
not<00:02:42.420> gonna<00:02:42.630> wait<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.080> there's<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> first

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
not gonna wait for you there's a first

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.520 
not gonna wait for you there's a first
call<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.130> second<00:02:44.790> call<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.450> closing<00:02:45.900> call<00:02:46.110> if

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
call a second call and a closing call if

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.590 
call a second call and a closing call if
you're<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.250> by<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.520> closing<00:02:47.940> call<00:02:48.120> you

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
you're not in by that closing call you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.390 
you're not in by that closing call you
are<00:02:48.690> not<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.200> class<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.160> all

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
are not in the class and this all

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.949 
are not in the class and this all
happens<00:02:50.820> whether<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> span<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.660> I'd<00:02:51.780> say

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
happens whether the span of like I'd say

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.780 
happens whether the span of like I'd say
two<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.290> three<00:02:52.500> minutes<00:02:52.830> basically<00:02:53.250> whenever

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
getting in that class so you gotta stay

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.050 
getting in that class so you gotta stay
on<00:03:07.110> top<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.620> what's<00:03:07.770> going<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:08.850> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
on top of what's going on and with that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.940 
on top of what's going on and with that
always<00:03:09.570> be<00:03:09.720> sure<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.900> periodically<00:03:10.530> check<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
always be sure to periodically check the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.310 
always be sure to periodically check the
pony<00:03:11.160> pound<00:03:11.430> cuz<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.780> were<00:03:12.870> probably<00:03:13.080> gonna

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
pony pound cuz you were probably gonna

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.900 
pony pound cuz you were probably gonna
forget<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:13.800> least<00:03:13.950> one<00:03:14.220> horse<00:03:14.459> somewhere

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
forget at least one horse somewhere

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.479 
forget at least one horse somewhere
along<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.330> line<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.840> forgot<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.800> last<00:03:17.070> year<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
along the line I forgot to last year and

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.100 
along the line I forgot to last year and
they<00:03:17.790> were<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.090> chillin<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.600> pony<00:03:18.810> pound

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
they were just chillin in the pony pound

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.259 
they were just chillin in the pony pound
so<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.739> down<00:03:20.010> by<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.220> left<00:03:20.550> side<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
so it's down by the left side of the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.120 
so it's down by the left side of the
judges<00:03:21.690> podium<00:03:22.170> also<00:03:22.560> be<00:03:22.680> sure<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.860> keep

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
judges podium also be sure to keep

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.009 
judges podium also be sure to keep
checking<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.550> board<00:03:23.880> they<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.780> big

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
checking the board they have this big

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.350 
checking the board they have this big
board<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:26.070> all<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.400> rings<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.209> says

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
board with all the rings and it says

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.880 
board with all the rings and it says
what<00:03:27.540> classes<00:03:27.989> are<00:03:28.080> up<00:03:28.230> right<00:03:28.380> then<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.739> there

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
what classes are up right then in there

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.590 
what classes are up right then in there
so<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.580> make<00:03:29.760> sure<00:03:29.790> you're<00:03:30.120> on<00:03:30.239> top<00:03:30.450> of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
so just make sure you're on top of

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.449 
so just make sure you're on top of
everything<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.590> jump<00:03:31.769> off<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.250> with

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
everything and to jump off of that with

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.580 
everything and to jump off of that with
the<00:03:32.670> Rings<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.209> believe<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:33.989> are<00:03:34.080> sixteen

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the Rings I believe there are sixteen

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.160 
the Rings I believe there are sixteen
rings<00:03:34.920> concurrently<00:03:35.550> go<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.510> again<00:03:36.870> there's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
rings concurrently go so again there's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.720 
rings concurrently go so again there's
so<00:03:37.320> many<00:03:37.440> divisions<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.459> got<00:03:38.610> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
so many divisions you just you got to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.270 
so many divisions you just you got to
keep<00:03:38.850> listening<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.810> only<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:41.040> division

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
keep listening so not only what division

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.550 
keep listening so not only what division
is<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.060> what<00:03:42.360> class<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.870> going<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.320> but

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
is going on what class is going on but

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.020 
is going on what class is going on but
also<00:03:43.680> what<00:03:43.950> color<00:03:44.220> ring<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.700> what<00:03:44.820> number

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
also what color ring and what number

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.509 
also what color ring and what number
ring<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:46.110> obviously<00:03:46.530> certain<00:03:46.860> ones<00:03:47.190> will<00:03:47.400> go

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
ring and obviously certain ones will go

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.920 
ring and obviously certain ones will go
on<00:03:47.640> multiple<00:03:48.000> rings<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> lot<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
on multiple rings like a lot of the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.710 
on multiple rings like a lot of the
bigger<00:03:49.110> classes<00:03:49.820> but<00:03:50.820> just<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.209> got<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.480> keep

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
bigger classes but just you got to keep

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.570 
bigger classes but just you got to keep
on<00:03:52.019> top<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.440> everything<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.890> cannot<00:03:53.190> stress

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
on top of everything I cannot stress

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.840
