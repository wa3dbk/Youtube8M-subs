00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Well, I suggest you start 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.189
 right away with the subaru eczet as 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.000
 you say is en route then on the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.980
 sb routes with benoÃ®t galand on hbo 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.990
 magazine the Belgian monthly of the car and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.990
 motor motorsport partner 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.619
 subaru is a case a little apart in the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.480
 world of automakers with 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.669
 one do not get very wide with one 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.140
 almost universal devotion to the 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.849
 full transmission and then with a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.920
 use of the diesel engine that has been 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.180
 on the late subaru does not make big 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.239
 something like the others it must be said 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.949
 and yet the Japanese builder has 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.510
 his followers thanks to his 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.420
 boxer engine in 4 cylinders flat 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.239
 diesel or gasoline for that matter 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.430
 its incomparable performance and then 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.410
 compactness too and then thanks well 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.719
 heard at its all-wheel drive and 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.250
 well subaru unanimously he was 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.340
 time for the Japanese builder of 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.960
 present a crossover 4x4 the xv and at 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.680
 side of the forester besides more 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.840
 beefy 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.200
 the xv and plays on a register resolutely 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.910
 modern more urban than forest the xv 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.340
 and there is a good chic crossover good kind 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.110
 with as much focus on the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.940
 comfort of its occupants than on its 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.680
 road qualities 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.119
 the line is frankly successful with its 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.070
 dynamic fighter 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.050
 the good news is that quality 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.440
 perceived in the cockpit is of good 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.910
 level 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.909
 which has not always been the case 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.650
 the past at subaru xv and offers 5 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.810
 Real seats and standard equipment 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.180
 is richly endowed with the subaru xv and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.970
 actually flirts with the premium category 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.009
 but beyond its alluring look the xb 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.780
 also offers a great behavior 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.350
 thanks in part to its 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.350
 full transmission 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.250
 as always at subaru the qualities 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.320
 Roads are above average 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.130
 a chassis that is very well suspended 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.900
 motor skills 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.240
 obviously flawless and then the engine 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.619
 diesel boxer that's full of going there 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.330
 do not need more to ensure the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.610
 pleasure of the driver and even his 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.290
 passengers just pity that the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.149
 boot of speed be somewhat 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.910
 imprecise based on the platform of the 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.370
 future impreza the xv and flies over the road 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.680
 imperiously with a position 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.540
 slightly elevated the 2001 driver 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.080
 road and this participates in the pleasure of 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.850
 conduct 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.850
 three levels of finishes are 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.130
 proposed in too luxury or executive 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.080
 like on our test car or the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.360
 leather navigation are standard 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.800
 if the xv and is offered with an engine 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.940
 2 liter gasoline 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.730
 the bulk of sales in belgium 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.980
 concerns the 2 liter diesel version in 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.390
 this category highly prized the boxer 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.190
 japanese is doing with all the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.959
 honors even if we could hope 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.150
 still a few more couples in 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.410
 the very low regime but the spread of 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.319
 the box allows an excellent level 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.940
 of performances whether it's in town on 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.680
 highway on a country lane 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.930
 the xv and always shoot themselves business 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.709
 brilliantly but his biggest asset is 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.810
 maybe its price less than 26 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.910
 thousand euros this subaru is is really 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.350
 agreement especially since his equipment is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 very rich and that at this price level 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.100
 most of its competitors do not offer 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.060
 that two-wheel drive and for those who 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.560
 have already tasted the day of the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.680
 full transmission they know that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.880
 safety efficiency and performance are 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.880
 constantly waiting for you 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.290
 four-wheel drive it's true that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.630
 it is a plus undeniable but 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.880
 remember our test plus winter's 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.780
 last week in the conditions 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.940
 delicate 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.970
 an all-wheel drive is not enough 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.060
 it is necessary to have the right tires 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.440
 in this case more winter thanks to 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.640
 these for four wheels but for two 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.170
 wheels you who are worthy motor one does 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.540
 how winter ah bah me finally and I 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.610
 think all reasonable people range 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.250
 wisely their motorcycle to the garage during 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.630
 the winter there are motorcycles with transmission 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.340
 integral among others to the dakar and that's 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.370
 a plus of course for motor skills 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.370
 but we must face the obvious 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.860
 ground contact of wheel tires 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.860
 of a motorcycle is so so small 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.350
 that it's lost on the snow or 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.010
 on the ice is to be the studded 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.080
 also in town hall 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.580
 that's it no it's forbidden on the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.580
 road me if it's forbidden
