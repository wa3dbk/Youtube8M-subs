00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
four feet all along the foundation here

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
four feet all along the foundation here
take<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.769> wall<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
take a look at this wall you see how it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
take a look at this wall you see how it
steps<00:01:06.390> down<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
steps down what you want to do with the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
steps down what you want to do with the
foundation<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> make<00:01:09.420> sure<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
foundation is you want to make sure that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
foundation is you want to make sure that
at<00:01:09.990> every<00:01:10.229> level<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.760> level<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.510> it's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
at every level it is level and it's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
at every level it is level and it's
steps<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.010> could<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.340> poured

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
steps down you know I could have poured

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
steps down you know I could have poured
a<00:01:14.880> solid<00:01:15.299> concrete<00:01:15.540> wall<00:01:16.080> across<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.950> but

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
a solid concrete wall across here but

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.469 
a solid concrete wall across here but
you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.000> been<00:01:18.060> more

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you know that would have just been more

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.649 
you know that would have just been more
money<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.040> happen<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.299> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
money so what will happen now is that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.280 
money so what will happen now is that
will<00:01:21.990> begin<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.530> set<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> blocks<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:24.420> center

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
will begin to set the blocks on center

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
will begin to set the blocks on center
across<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.340> foundation<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.689> down

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
across this foundation all the way down

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
across this foundation all the way down
just<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.979> Lego<00:01:29.220> blocks<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.119> we'll

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just like little Lego blocks so we'll

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
just like little Lego blocks so we'll
build<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> was

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
build it up from there but it was

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770 
build it up from there but it was
important<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.939> sure<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
important to make sure that we have the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.530 
important to make sure that we have the
foundation<00:01:34.530> set<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.820> look<00:01:36.000> over<00:01:36.150> here

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
foundation set and if you look over here

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.050 
foundation set and if you look over here
you'll<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.619> reinforcing<00:01:38.310> steel<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you'll see that the reinforcing steel is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.580 
you'll see that the reinforcing steel is
coming<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:40.610> underneath<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.350> these

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
coming out underneath here and these

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
coming out underneath here and these
walls<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:46.159> load-bearing<00:01:47.159> walls

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
walls are going to be load-bearing walls

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
walls are going to be load-bearing walls
in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> house<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.960> important<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
in the house so it's important to have a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
in the house so it's important to have a
solid<00:01:50.250> foundation<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:51.240> over<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.659> these

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
solid foundation that over here these

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
solid foundation that over here these
piers<00:01:52.229> haven't<00:01:52.680> been<00:01:52.829> poured<00:01:53.189> yet<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.030> these

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
piers haven't been poured yet so these

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
piers haven't been poured yet so these
will<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.479> piers<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.470> help<00:01:55.590> support<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
