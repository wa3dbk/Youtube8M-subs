 let's access the word in a moment 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.520
 more already saw the children your children and 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.750
 says one of them is malnourished 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 in fact he has not even taken the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.820
 vaccines I think they have not even 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.900
 registered 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.190
 to neither of them for lack of 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.690
 papers because you do not have minutes of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 birth or you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.130
