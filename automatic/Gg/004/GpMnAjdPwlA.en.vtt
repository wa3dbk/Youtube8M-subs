00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.879
 new video by iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.170
 today let's take a look at the new one 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.170
 application messages 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.730
 well found boys today look 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.060
 quick to one of the applications 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.650
 perhaps more evolved with ios 8 we are 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.800
 speaking of messages left out 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 fact that I type 8 thousand tests because 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.329
 all the various tests I have have it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.910
 done 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.250
 however, we immediately see the news then 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.199
 meanwhile like other features up 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.400
 of the apple operating system now 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.250
 we have the new keyboard you see with the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.280
 text that is in fact predicted by 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.559
 these three little buttons and then we have 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 then these new buttons are on the way 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.000
 oh well that being we know it all 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 but when there is no text 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.379
 typed turns into this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.570
 pulsantino that now sees tested in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.820
 actually you don't see but I'm acquiring a 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.710
 voice memo I don't know what the limit is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 honestly if it's a minute like 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.660
 whatsapp but it's okay we stop here 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 and we can also listen to the memo 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:24.840
 before sending it we feel I don't know how 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.119
 but you hear the registration 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.150
 I say that at the moment at least in the beta 1 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.430
 ios 8 voice recording really 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.890
 at very low levels 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.020
 we are not remotely close to the levels 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 of whatsapp however you see 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.970
 by pressing the up button with that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 dart you can send ours 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.040
 more memos we have here one 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.530
 quick image selection more 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.439
 recent to be able to send them so immediately 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.329
 on the fly you see I select a fax 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.670
 sends photos or I can also 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.149
 add a comment clearly nothing 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.240
 of particular and the photo is sent 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.009
 then we will know instead about details or the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 page of the person I am contacting 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.340
 with information possibility to do 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.810
 call gsm or facetime the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.329
 display of all attachments 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.250
 Shared down here I can andarmi 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.829
 to fish out this way 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.200
 now I do not care is the function 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.209
 do not disturb now only active for 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.970
 individual chats so this means that 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.460
 if you are in a group chat a lot 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.230
 boring on imac 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.000
 if you have a person who bores you 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.150
 you want to read only when you decide 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.230
 your messages sent 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.450
 activated do not disturb state 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 don't worry then we share my location 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.140
 which allows you to share with this 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.630
 person we are contacting ours 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.630
 geographical location for an hour up to 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.330
 end of the day or no more limits 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.090
 we can send as on whatsapp now 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.830
 our gps position directly 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.320
 in the chat so that then that 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.480
 person who receives it can take up 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.760
 of it and possibly receive 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.850
 road signs still from 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.230
 imessage settings on ios 8 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.010
 we can choose to archive the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.870
 messages always after 30 days or after a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.720
 year this means the messages 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.580
 will be canceled after a certain amount of time 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.650
 see this mineral action 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.180
 messages older than 30 days 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.700
 in this way we are sure of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
 delete all messages already received 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.890
 archived older than 30 days but 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.050
 not just the messages that will become ad 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.940
 example hands 30 days old 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.860
 they will be deleted in this way 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.780
 same speech with the choice one year 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.030
 which however clearly moves forward 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.580
 this limit to a year then how 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.530
 we have also seen in the dedicated video 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.340
 to the rapid response to new ones 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.350
 notifications clearly ios 8 allows you to 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.150
 respond quickly to notifications 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.400
 that we receive on our device if 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.050

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.540

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.890
