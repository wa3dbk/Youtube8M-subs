think it's cool the first few weren't

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
think it's cool the first few weren't
like<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.780> one

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
awesome and it's really not too

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
awesome and it's really not too

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
difficult to put a minifigure on the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
difficult to put a minifigure on the
sphere<00:01:46.399> most<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.640> probably<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.420> by

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
sphere most of you probably know this by

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.600 
sphere most of you probably know this by
now<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> take<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> off

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
now but what you do is you take that off

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.080 
now but what you do is you take that off
and<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> easiest<00:01:52.530> ways<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.909> him

holding<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.509> weapon<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.909> just

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
holding a weapon and then you're just

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.410 
holding a weapon and then you're just
gonna<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> set<00:01:57.719> him<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:58.670> right<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
gonna want to set him down right here on

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
gonna want to set him down right here on
the<00:02:00.930> speeder<00:02:01.369> after<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.430> take<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.729> off<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the speeder after you take that off and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.180 
the speeder after you take that off and
it's<00:02:03.840> easiest<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.619> lean<00:02:04.829> him<00:02:05.040> back<00:02:07.190> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it's easiest just to lean him back and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.520 
it's easiest just to lean him back and
then<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.670> clip<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.390> together

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.490 

like<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:14.600> you've<00:02:14.990> got<00:02:15.200> your

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
like that and then you've got your

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.180 
like that and then you've got your
minifigure<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.220> your<00:02:16.430> speeder<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.920> he's<00:02:18.920> not

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
minifigure on your speeder and he's not

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.890 
minifigure on your speeder and he's not
going<00:02:19.490> anywhere<00:02:19.550> he's<00:02:20.120> hooked<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.660> there

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
going anywhere he's hooked in there

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.140

as<00:02:58.489> soon<00:02:58.730> as<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:59.030> started<00:02:59.540> building<00:02:59.780> it<00:03:00.050> was

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
as soon as I started building it was

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.190 
as soon as I started building it was
that<00:03:01.040> most<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.209> them<00:03:02.360> only<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> six

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
that most of them only have the six

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.440 
that most of them only have the six
pieces<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.650> Qi<00:03:04.010> right<00:03:04.280> here<00:03:04.489> these<00:03:05.180> little

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
pieces of Qi right here these little

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.860 
pieces of Qi right here these little
pieces<00:03:05.630> right<00:03:05.840> here<00:03:06.160> however<00:03:07.510> you've<00:03:08.510> got<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
pieces right here however you've got the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.170 
pieces right here however you've got the
six<00:03:09.200> right<00:03:09.470> here<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.010> you've<00:03:10.220> also<00:03:10.400> got<00:03:10.760> one

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
six right here and you've also got one

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.870 
six right here and you've also got one
on<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.750> set<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:12.650> technically<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.310> get<00:03:13.459> seven

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
on the set so technically you get seven

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.810 
on the set so technically you get seven
pieces<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.269> Qi<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.569> this<00:03:14.720> which<00:03:14.989> is<00:03:15.019> cool

can<00:03:59.120> come<00:03:59.299> through<00:03:59.570> here<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.470> when<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.709> knock

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
can come through here and when you knock

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.509 
can come through here and when you knock
this<00:04:01.160> down<00:04:02.590> makes<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.190> second

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
this down makes it so that the second

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.190 
this down makes it so that the second
person<00:04:04.640> can't<00:04:05.090> go<00:04:05.209> through<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.049> they're

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
person can't go through so they're

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.560 
person can't go through so they're
trying<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.440> stuck<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.910> just<00:04:08.120> kind<00:04:08.480> of

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
trying to stuck and it just kind of

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.569 
trying to stuck and it just kind of
pushes<00:04:08.930> this<00:04:09.079> out<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.650> not<00:04:09.799> connected<00:04:10.100> as

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
pushes this out this is not connected as

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.330 
pushes this out this is not connected as
you<00:04:10.760> can<00:04:10.880> see<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.209> just<00:04:11.450> kind<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.440> holds<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.220> up

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
you can see it just kind of holds it up

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.670 
you can see it just kind of holds it up
but<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.060> think<00:04:14.299> it's<00:04:14.420> awesome<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:15.260> mean<00:04:15.320> it's
