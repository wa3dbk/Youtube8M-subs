00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.130
 3 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.009
 we can approve the nokia n97 the most powerful Nokia terminal 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.740
 and the third in which the Finnish manufacturer uses a touch screen 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.390
 This terminal Nokia united a touch screen of 3 with 5 inches 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.909
 with a qwerty keyboard 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.109
 that is collected behind the screen 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.090
 and that has the peculiarity that when deployed it tilts 45 degrees 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.780
 this makes it especially comfortable 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.350
 We can not leave the terminal on the table for example for the media 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.100
 or we can create in it 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 having the screen at a more appropriate angle than if it remained flat the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.080
 truth is that the work they have done with the keyboard and the mechanism for 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.969
 handle him 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.969
 it's pretty good 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.170
 the screen has a diagonal of 3 with 5 inches 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.000
 this format 16 9 and can reproduce 16 with 7 million colors 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 per hundred the resolution is 640 by 360 pixels an allied high format 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 definition and it's a screen of resistive type 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.580
 what does that mean? 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.260
 that unlike on the iphone 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.100
 that this one handles with quite solid 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.060
 on this screen 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.340
 you have to make a very slight pressure so that it can move 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.260
 to tackle the screens of resistive type is that they allow to use a 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.400
 writing pointer 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.300
 and writing recognition applications that those of capacitive type 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.800
 ninth does not allow however nokia has not included any space in it 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.999
 terminal 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.780
 to take the pointer 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440
 what does this include 1 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 a small pointer we can not try on the mobile 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 and what can be used to write 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.529
 we could even get to write with our finger 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.319
 very easily because the system of writing recognition aes work 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.999
 fairly good 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.159
 If what we want is to live 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.549
 is too long and we manage with the pointer we can always open the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.889
 screen and walk qwerty keyboard staf 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.859
 on that nail and in addition there was a small step 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.299
 with which we can manage 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.159
 The lists 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.869
 we can manage up and down 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.700
 select applications although you have the keyboard read 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.209
 the size of the mobile is not too excessive 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.159
 in fact to be very similar to a nokia n81 for example 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.329
 just a little more weight from mexico and less than other phones that have 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.229
 also keyboards 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.339
 the terminal has position sensors we can activate you to do 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.829
 different functions 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.829
 for example two do that is that the screen automatically 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.450
 did also happens for example when we open the keyboard although laporta be 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:10.409
 other 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.069
 it is assumed that surfing 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.279
 horizontal format 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.279
 On the left we have a small button to unlock the screen 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.089
 that way it feels blocked 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.769
 nor do we avoid that in your pocket you can ibarra tamayo sensor 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.789
 proximity on top 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:31.319
 so that when we roger we go to the face to talk it also blocks the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.749
 screen 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 corruption is simply open the phone 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.469
 otherwise government press on a 5 megapixel camera with lens 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:42.779
 carl zeiss 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.179
 with an iodine doublet to illuminate 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:47.029
 this gives you 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.329
 a worse result than a xenon flash in photographs 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.329
 but allows it to be used also says 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.859
 for the lid automatically the camera is set low 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.769
 It has a slot 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.030
 for micro SD cards that unfortunately is behind the lid 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 it's just a little bit more uncomfortable 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.209
 and a cd battery allows us to have a very good opportunity we have not had 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.449
 none afflict the time we have been testing 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.749
 the sovereign 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:26.619
 the periods of distributing a connector of standard helmets of 3 5 millimeters the 

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:30.399
 charging is done with a micro usb cd connector following the new standard 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.240
 and also with the terminal 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.789
 an accessory is included 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.929
 that allows us if we have federal an old charger of nokia I know how to do 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.050
 of the oldest, widest model 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.779
 we can move it 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.779
 we can use it to convert it backwards 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.899
 and load with this transformer also the n97
