00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
now this is a very simple map with a

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.009 
now this is a very simple map with a
simple<00:00:08.400> concept<00:00:08.610> it's<00:00:09.030> infection<00:00:09.599> there<00:00:09.929> are

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
simple concept it's infection there are

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
want to weave around the block center

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
want to weave around the block center
inside<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.039> maze<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.939> have

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
inside of this maze because you have

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.429 
inside of this maze because you have
kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.539> whole<00:00:24.750> bunch<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> these<00:00:25.170> hallways

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
kind of a whole bunch of these hallways

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
kind of a whole bunch of these hallways
that<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.010> turn<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.609> weave<00:00:27.029> around<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that you can turn and weave around the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.450 
that you can turn and weave around the
different<00:00:27.869> boxes<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.619> through<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.310> can

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
different boxes to get through you can

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.609 
different boxes to get through you can
either<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> corner<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.539> say<00:00:30.929> hmm<00:00:31.260> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
either be at the corner and say hmm I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.740 
either be at the corner and say hmm I
think<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.250> I'll<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.940> safe<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.480> because

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
think that I'll be safe here because

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
think that I'll be safe here because
they<00:00:33.960> only<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.530> ways<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> getting<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> me

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
they only have two ways of getting to me

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
they only have two ways of getting to me
but<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.690> there's<00:00:36.840> two<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.050> them

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
but then you think there's two of them

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
but then you think there's two of them
they<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> trap<00:00:38.010> me<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.550> maybe<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
they can trap me or maybe just one and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.819 
they can trap me or maybe just one and
then<00:00:39.510> he<00:00:39.540> comes<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.989> nowhere<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.680> only

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
then he comes out of nowhere and I only

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.100 
then he comes out of nowhere and I only
have<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.160> place<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.660> place<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
have one place to go that one place to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.619 
have one place to go that one place to
go<00:00:43.260> most<00:00:44.070> likely<00:00:44.280> will<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.670> me<00:00:44.820> killed<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
go most likely will get me killed so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
go most likely will get me killed so
either<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.350> weave<00:00:46.649> around<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
either you weave around or you go to the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
either you weave around or you go to the
corners<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.660> are<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> bunch<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> different

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
corners there are a bunch of different

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.470 
corners there are a bunch of different
ways<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.890> survive<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.059> either<00:00:51.210> way

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
ways you can survive this but either way

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
ways you can survive this but either way
it's<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.079> spooky<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.640> got

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's going to be spooky because you got

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
it's going to be spooky because you got
the<00:00:54.120> red<00:00:54.719> swords<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.860> infected<00:00:56.219> people

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

zombie is if two of them go out at once
you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.890> tell<00:01:23.040> we're<00:01:23.189> both<00:01:23.369> Lamar<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you can tell we're both Lamar and you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
you can tell we're both Lamar and you
can<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:24.960> advantage<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.409> get

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
can use that to your advantage to get

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
can use that to your advantage to get
around<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.189> try<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.460> stay<00:01:26.700> away<00:01:26.909> from<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
around and try and stay away from the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
around and try and stay away from the
zombies<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.350> only<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.189> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
zombies but you can only do that for so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
zombies but you can only do that for so
long<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> keep<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.540> moving<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
long so you want to keep on moving and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.660 
long so you want to keep on moving and
weaving<00:01:31.590> through<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.979> least<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
weaving through at least that's what I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
weaving through at least that's what I
did<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.320> dangerous

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
did and that can be very dangerous

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.350 
did and that can be very dangerous
because<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.340> zombies<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:35.970> going

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
because the zombies are also going

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.030 
because the zombies are also going
through<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.659> maze<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.560> happen<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
through this maze and if they happen to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
through this maze and if they happen to
stumble<00:01:38.520> upon<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.509> most<00:01:39.689> likely

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
stumble upon you you will most likely

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
stumble upon you you will most likely
die<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> very<00:01:41.490> pretty

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
die it's not going to be a very pretty

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.270 
die it's not going to be a very pretty
death<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:43.020> around<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.380> sides<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
death if you go around the sides which a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
death if you go around the sides which a
lot<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> people<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.210> immediately<00:01:46.140> after

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
lot of people do just immediately after

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.780 
lot of people do just immediately after
playing<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.920> map<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> first<00:01:47.549> time<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
playing this map for the first time a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
playing this map for the first time a
lot<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> people<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.420> around<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> sides<00:01:49.049> which

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
lot of people go around the sides which

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.370 
lot of people go around the sides which
I<00:01:49.860> guess<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.430> smart<00:01:50.790> idea<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.200> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I guess is a smart idea because you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
I guess is a smart idea because you can
see<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.890> way<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> hallway

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
see all the way down that hallway

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
see all the way down that hallway
there's<00:01:54.240> nobody<00:01:54.570> behind<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.259> anything

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
there's nobody behind you or anything

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
there's nobody behind you or anything
but<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.880> zombie<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.329> also

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
but the thing is the zombie can also

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
but the thing is the zombie can also
know<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.530> lot<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.860> people<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
know that a lot of people are there and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.130 
know that a lot of people are there and
it's<00:01:59.729> very<00:01:59.909> easy<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.299> see<00:02:00.540> them<00:02:00.780> because

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it's very easy to see them because

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's very easy to see them because
there's<00:02:01.500> only<00:02:01.530> four<00:02:01.890> sides<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.430> only<00:02:02.549> have

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
there's only four sides they only have

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.910 
there's only four sides they only have
to<00:02:02.759> check<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.180> areas<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> fun<00:02:04.530> map<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to check for areas so it's a fun map and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.819 
to check for areas so it's a fun map and
its<00:02:05.040> really<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.619> bit

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
its really really it's got a little bit

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.859 
its really really it's got a little bit
of<00:02:07.860> strategy<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.300> say<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.690> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
of strategy to it now I will say this is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.900 
of strategy to it now I will say this is
not<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.110> creative<00:02:10.800> map<00:02:11.129> I've<00:02:11.340> seen<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.730> map

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
not a creative map I've seen this map

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.860 
not a creative map I've seen this map

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it is just because it's a fun map

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.880
