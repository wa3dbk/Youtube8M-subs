little video showing our takashima
al-wasat<00:00:05.819> oh<00:00:06.029> how<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.629> cuts<00:00:06.839> will<00:00:07.500> kind<00:00:07.680> of

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
al-wasat oh how it cuts will kind of

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.250 
al-wasat oh how it cuts will kind of
finish<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.160> leaves<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.700> what<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.750> looks<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
finish it leaves and what it looks and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.070 
finish it leaves and what it looks and
sounds<00:00:10.530> like<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.509> small<00:00:12.630> talk

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
sounds like so here is a small talk

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.780 
sounds like so here is a small talk
lashing<00:00:13.349> my<00:00:13.469> lasso<00:00:13.710> though<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.460> doesn't<00:00:14.639> have

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
lashing my lasso though it doesn't have

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.460 
lashing my lasso though it doesn't have
a<00:00:14.880> base<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.299> anymore<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.960> that's<00:00:16.080> because

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
a base on it anymore and that's because

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.710 
a base on it anymore and that's because
I've<00:00:16.650> used<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.279> vigorously<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> base

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
I've used it so vigorously that the base

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.710 
I've used it so vigorously that the base
has<00:00:19.470> come<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.180> haven't<00:00:21.420> had<00:00:21.510> time<00:00:21.660> yet

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
has come off and I haven't had time yet

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.400 
has come off and I haven't had time yet
to<00:00:22.050> reattach<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:23.359> mind<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.960> used<00:00:25.230> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
to reattach it mind you I have used it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.279 
to reattach it mind you I have used it
probably<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.980> than<00:00:26.130> most<00:00:26.189> people<00:00:26.460> ever<00:00:26.730> will

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
probably more than most people ever will

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.339 
probably more than most people ever will
so<00:00:28.289> don't<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.400> worried<00:00:29.640> about<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:31.170> does

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so don't be worried about it but it does

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410 
so don't be worried about it but it does
it<00:00:31.619> does<00:00:31.800> work<00:00:32.040> better<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> has<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> base

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it does work better when it has a base

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
it does work better when it has a base
underneath<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.950> gives<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> stone<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
underneath it and I gives the stone a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750 
underneath it and I gives the stone a
little<00:00:35.969> bit<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.239> stability<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:37.680> would<00:00:38.550> worry

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
little bit more stability I would worry

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.880 
little bit more stability I would worry
about<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.480> possibly<00:00:39.930> cracking<00:00:40.410> over

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
about it you know possibly cracking over

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.500 
about it you know possibly cracking over
time<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.550> too<00:00:41.760> much<00:00:41.850> pressure<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
time if you use too much pressure on it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.959 
time if you use too much pressure on it
and<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.809> weren't<00:00:43.079> careful<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:44.489> sides<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and you weren't careful the sides of the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.600 
and you weren't careful the sides of the
stone<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.629> lacquered<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> clear<00:00:47.340> lacquer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
stone are lacquered with a clear lacquer

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.100 
stone are lacquered with a clear lacquer
so<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> different<00:00:48.870> layers<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so you can see the different layers in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.479 
so you can see the different layers in
the<00:00:49.289> stone<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.309> hiding

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the stone it's not really hiding

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
the stone it's not really hiding
anything<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.110> does<00:00:52.379> protect

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
anything there but it also does protect

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.360 
anything there but it also does protect
the<00:00:52.829> stone<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.430> cracking<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.600> flaking<00:00:54.840> away

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
the stone from cracking or flaking away

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
the stone from cracking or flaking away
so<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.750> why<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so when you see it that's why it is that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.369 
so when you see it that's why it is that
way<00:00:59.480> anyways<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> our<00:01:01.500> kitchen<00:01:02.070> AG<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
way anyways here is our kitchen AG and

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.050 
way anyways here is our kitchen AG and
let's<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> work

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.880 

so<00:01:11.060> again<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.420> natural<00:01:11.810> stones<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.410> think<00:01:12.800> I

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
so again with natural stones I think I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.710 
so again with natural stones I think I
showed<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.280> video<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.850> did<00:01:14.090> with<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.330> sita

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
showed in the video I did with the sita

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.780 
showed in the video I did with the sita
you<00:01:15.200> start<00:01:15.500> off<00:01:15.650> with<00:01:15.860> harder<00:01:16.190> pressure<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
you start off with harder pressure and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.930 
you start off with harder pressure and
the<00:01:16.970> goal<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.540> work<00:01:17.690> up<00:01:17.900> mud<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.760> top

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
the goal is to work up mud and the top

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.000 
the goal is to work up mud and the top
oisin<00:01:20.210> mawa<00:01:20.510> sato<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.990> pretty<00:01:21.320> muddy<00:01:21.620> stone

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
oisin mawa sato is a pretty muddy stone

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.740 
oisin mawa sato is a pretty muddy stone
pretty<00:01:22.400> quickly<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:28.490> once<00:01:29.270> we<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.540> mud

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
pretty quickly and once we have mud

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.400 
pretty quickly and once we have mud
worked<00:01:29.990> up<00:01:30.250> we're<00:01:31.250> going<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.400> spend<00:01:31.640> time

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
worked up we're going to spend time

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:46.390 
worked up we're going to spend time
refining<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.740> but<00:01:33.950> using<00:01:34.760> lighter<00:01:34.970> pressure

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.160 

I'm<00:01:47.060> going<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.240> add<00:01:47.330> water<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> stone

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
I'm going to add water to the stone

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.500 
I'm going to add water to the stone
don't<00:01:48.650> add<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:48.860> lot<00:01:48.980> at<00:01:49.310> any<00:01:49.460> time<00:01:49.760> add<00:01:50.060> just

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
don't add a lot at any time add just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.450 
don't add a lot at any time add just
enough<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.200> keep<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.500> mud<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:51.950> there<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
enough to keep the mud on there and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.630 
enough to keep the mud on there and
working<00:01:52.970> smoothly<00:01:54.100> if<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.190> add<00:01:55.340> too<00:01:55.610> much

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
working smoothly if you add too much

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.700 
working smoothly if you add too much
you're<00:01:56.000> going<00:01:56.120> to<00:01:56.180> rinse<00:01:56.360> away<00:01:56.570> all<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.380> your

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
you're going to rinse away all of your

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.910 
you're going to rinse away all of your
work<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.190> refining<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.850> mud<00:01:59.380> if<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.860> course

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
work and refining the mud if of course

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.650 
work and refining the mud if of course
you<00:02:01.220> add<00:02:01.340> too<00:02:01.520> little<00:02:01.760> it's<00:02:02.300> going<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.540> be<00:02:02.630> a

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
you add too little it's going to be a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:22.890 
you add too little it's going to be a
pain<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.990> sharpen<00:02:03.320> on<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> very<00:02:03.680> dry<00:02:03.860> stone

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.809 

and<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.170> see<00:02:24.380> from<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> slurry<00:02:25.700> that

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
and you can see from the slurry that

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.729 
and you can see from the slurry that
it's<00:02:26.180> got<00:02:26.360> almost<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.870> grayish<00:02:27.170> color<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.650> it

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
it's got almost the grayish color to it

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.120 
it's got almost the grayish color to it
already

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
already

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.160 
already
and<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.849> did<00:02:29.030> initially<00:02:29.300> have<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> very<00:02:29.930> gray

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
and it did initially have a very gray

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.110 
and it did initially have a very gray
color<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.069> it's<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.610> stone<00:02:31.819> cuts

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
color and it's because the stone cuts

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.850 
color and it's because the stone cuts
relatively<00:02:32.720> quick<00:02:32.959> especially<00:02:33.680> for<00:02:33.830> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
relatively quick especially for a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.420 
relatively quick especially for a
natural<00:02:34.040> stone<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.730> I'm<00:02:35.480> also<00:02:35.630> cutting<00:02:35.959> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
natural stone and I'm also cutting a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.729 
natural stone and I'm also cutting a
very<00:02:37.430> hard<00:02:37.760> semi<00:02:38.690> stainless<00:02:39.200> steel<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.590> it's

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
very hard semi stainless steel so it's

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.059 
very hard semi stainless steel so it's
not<00:02:39.890> even<00:02:40.130> carbon<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.900> most<00:02:41.900> people<00:02:42.200> use<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
not even carbon and most people use the

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.490 
not even carbon and most people use the
Naturals<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.700> carbon<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.300> just<00:02:45.110> want<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.350> show

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
Naturals on carbon I just want to show

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.559 
Naturals on carbon I just want to show
you<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> works<00:02:46.069> on<00:02:46.640> stainless<00:02:47.300> steels

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
you that it works on stainless steels

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.390 
you that it works on stainless steels
and<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.989> works<00:02:48.170> on<00:02:48.440> semi<00:02:48.709> stainless<00:02:49.160> steels

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
and it works on semi stainless steels

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.110 
and it works on semi stainless steels
also<00:02:54.220> let's<00:02:55.220> see<00:02:55.370> how<00:02:55.489> we're<00:02:55.640> coming<00:02:55.910> along

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
also let's see how we're coming along

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:51.220 
also let's see how we're coming along
here

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 

with<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.129> little<00:03:52.370> bit<00:03:52.550> more<00:03:52.730> work<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.209> get<00:03:53.330> an

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
with a little bit more work I can get an

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.330 
with a little bit more work I can get an
even<00:03:53.599> better<00:03:53.780> even<00:03:54.050> finish<00:03:54.319> there<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:54.800> here

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
even better even finish there but here

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.160 
even better even finish there but here
you<00:03:55.459> can<00:03:55.610> kind<00:03:55.849> of<00:03:55.910> see<00:03:56.120> how<00:03:56.840> it's<00:03:57.019> coming

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
you can kind of see how it's coming

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.059 
you can kind of see how it's coming
along

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.580 

and<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:00.939> that<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.540> toughest<00:04:01.959> email<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.379> said
