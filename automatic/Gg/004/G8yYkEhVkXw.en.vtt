00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.150
 to me 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.120
 it's like they're welcome to a new 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.320
 video and good guys this time 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.879
 we are back conscious for 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.139
 minecraft because although this that they 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.000
 I bring beautiful doses of those 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 chuladas for all the people who 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 they like children or they will love it so 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 remember that the names are those of 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.509
 the description so these guys 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.540
 they have double or more huge so the 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.009
 first is crack 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 just 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.410
 but we give him the same following 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.000
 creative so well yes I think that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.189
 They can serve you because you like the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 snowballs or what do I know a world 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.510
 so with avoided it would be very nice 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.950
 survival and creative masters we think 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 what is possible to do any kind 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.880
 of construction with that so that they 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.950
 we put on that part boys and if 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.380
 let's go up you can see that the map 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.110
 It is composed more or less 80% 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.150
 I deny that you really see those 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 incredible and that here we have ice and 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.750
 Well, what I like to say is that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 we have here this water pit not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.090
 but this is not what I like these 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 boys we have these types rivers 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 over here that give a very nice touch 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.439
 here we have a little cane for this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.440
 part we have a little normal language 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.180
 boys a little bit of grass x and then 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.250
 now that we have a great 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.980
 pit or rather looks like a frozen lake 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.870
 that there is so nothing because it is so much 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.490
 mystery simply that a snow circus 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.280
 so later I hope you like it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.890
 guys and here we have more snow in 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 this part we have a water pit and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 over there we have nothing so that's 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.440
 everything with respect to that is to say I hope that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.330
 like it and let's go with the next one 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.790
 boys I think it's just 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.080
 beautiful and the next if you want this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.610
 whole is the cndh and right here are the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.229
 I put for you to see it ender slender 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.460
 as a mixture between anderman and that of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 ander but good that's not important and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.540
 I live them just but here we are generated in 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.040
 a creative way as always so 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.869
 nothing guys wilkins actually that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.100
 these sets because I like snow a lot 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.899
 and everything so well remember that if 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.490
 you want more and then comment it so that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.740
 know and bring more here than yes 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 here we are made we hope here karl 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.230
 and well, actually, I think he lived more 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.970
 minecraft favorite would be the tundra 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.200
 because the desert that yes that here 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.270
 we are not asked but good 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.800
 you can see that for that part we have what 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.680
 which is a biome like any other 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.940
 language then of normal forest here 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.560
 we have a lot of water that actually 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.690
 not bad around here have never 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.490
 a little sand and then in this part 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.290
 boys we have what is the language of 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.640
 snow that is very extensive and I am 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.870
 like it more than the previous one for the simple 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.580
 fact that we have more than everything 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.980
 mountains with me so why the car 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.500
 that is very beautiful to the world and then nothing 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.300
 it is simply a biome with snow there is no 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.100
 nothing more damn in just a 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.840
 biome with a lot of snow that I love is 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
 a sky so here we have a 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100
 little more sand here in this 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.660
 port we have a few hills that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.430
 a few trees and then really 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.010
 what more would be needed in this world 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.660
 I think it 's a defect they are trees like that 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.030
 that they would have to go talk is 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.620
 fried so it's all liked you know 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.180

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.210
