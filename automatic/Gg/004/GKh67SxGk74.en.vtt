in<00:03:17.280> Pokemon<00:03:18.280> but<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.880> scene<00:03:19.209> right<00:03:19.239> there<00:03:19.600> is

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
in Pokemon but that scene right there is

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.850

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
trend of custom Pokemon games moving

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.710 
trend of custom Pokemon games moving
towards<00:03:26.470> RPG<00:03:26.920> maker<00:03:27.130> kind<00:03:27.579> of<00:03:27.700> games<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.239> that

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
towards RPG maker kind of games is that

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.390 
towards RPG maker kind of games is that
it<00:03:28.870> allows<00:03:29.110> them<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.440> lot<00:03:29.620> more<00:03:29.650> freedom<00:03:30.070> you're

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
it allows them a lot more freedom you're

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.300 
it allows them a lot more freedom you're
no<00:03:30.519> longer<00:03:30.820> restricted<00:03:31.269> by<00:03:31.630> what<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:33.070> roms

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
no longer restricted by what the roms

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.250 
no longer restricted by what the roms
force<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.060> do<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.540> things<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:34.840> that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
force you to do and things like that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.810 
force you to do and things like that
that<00:03:35.620> also<00:03:35.829> means<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.220> requires<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.549> lot<00:03:36.790> more

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
that also means it requires a lot more

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.000 
that also means it requires a lot more
dev<00:03:37.269> work<00:03:37.540> however<00:03:40.230> barrier<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.380> entry<00:03:41.530> is

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
dev work however barrier of entry is

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.990 
dev work however barrier of entry is
never<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.670> reasonable<00:03:43.450> complaint<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:45.670> think

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
never a reasonable complaint and I think

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.650 
never a reasonable complaint and I think
it's<00:03:46.180> led<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.570> lot<00:03:46.870> more<00:03:47.170> creative<00:03:47.650> titles

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
it's led to a lot more creative titles
