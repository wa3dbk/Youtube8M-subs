same farm that the carrots did they were

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.530 
same farm that the carrots did they were
picked<00:02:39.870> two<00:02:40.530> days<00:02:40.680> ago<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:42.150> why<00:02:42.329> they're

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
picked two days ago that's why they're

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.900 
picked two days ago that's why they're
really<00:02:43.110> firm<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:44.040> why<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.220> skins<00:02:44.670> are

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
really firm that's why the skins are

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.940 
really firm that's why the skins are
nice<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.299> tight<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.769> better

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
nice and tight it's just a better

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.699 
nice and tight it's just a better
representation<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.849> flavor<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:49.200> smell

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
representation of flavor and the smell

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.530 
representation of flavor and the smell
again<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.250> smell<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.610> incredible<00:02:50.760> I'm<00:02:51.390> going

again the smell is incredible I'm going
to<00:02:51.599> tilt<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.840> pan<00:02:52.079> don't<00:02:52.680> make<00:02:52.769> keratin<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
to tilt the pan don't make keratin and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.380 
to tilt the pan don't make keratin and
now<00:02:55.470> we've<00:02:55.650> got<00:02:55.799> sizzle<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.819> I'm<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.239> going

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to toss them in the pan to get them

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.470 
to toss them in the pan to get them
color<00:03:01.190> I'm<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.459> give<00:03:02.610> them<00:03:02.760> over<00:03:03.269> high

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
color I'm going to give them over high

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.479 
color I'm going to give them over high
