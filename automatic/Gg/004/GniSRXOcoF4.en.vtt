00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 very good to all these guys in this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 case we are in a couple of then now 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.619
 that the truth is a character that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 I like it a lot and also it's funny 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.189
 no one had gone before him 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.320
 send a character of being a person 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 that is a very very cool character is a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.759
 game that I many years ago 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.409
 I played and I loved apart from the game in 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.270
 yes I did not love the subject that has 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.380
 as a good at stake in which we have 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.820
 a ship quotes and we have to put her 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.440
 I think it was called something like a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 very strange thing that we can be adding 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 that like new cannons to the wool 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.030
 we saw between the world and the world in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.440
 world of the ddi in the world of such and was 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.970
 an awesome game but good without 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.130
 more writing at the bottom of one is 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.200
 inverted to have is medium for me 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 parker that I wanted to come reading now 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.440
 welcome then parkour 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.540
 grab the things from the chest and go towards 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.830
 the root of the train outside suddenly 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.510
 appears more within short so for 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.580
 see visions do parkour ok 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 Perfect plays the survival king mode 1 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.470
 in emergencies and xd and you put that one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.360
 funny charity parkour a trolley 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.760
 peace station shift and here is a block 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 coal ballet block of gold and clay 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.820
 good thing is that I'm playing with 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.260
 a couple of textures that you have asked me 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.940
 bet that I put it I guess it will be 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.010
 because the character will look better and such 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.930
 and he told me that it is based on the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:29.820
 502 character if I am not mistaken so 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 let's see the booklets as I saw 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.340
 there we are going to send greetings today Augustine 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.720
 Argentinian newsletter Augustine and I hope that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 You are having a great time because you have 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 Have a good day from the rails and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.970
 there will not be inverted until certain 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.620
 point finds that it will invest while 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.940
 you travel in the first car what I feel 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.710
 is to invest that is now because they ruin 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.240
 pixelar when you are this point appears 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.890
 in parkour but well I think that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.270
 I have blue posts that 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.870
 directly so let's go and sir 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.870
 bears how I like to be 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 bullets but the footballers of the lord 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.560
 now you know what to do 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.680
 what the fuck what's up my friend 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.680
 a manager can get there 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.730
 the same will be tested, but as you can 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.620
 understand this is crazy what 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.010
 take them away even if it's more I think that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.599
 this block does not even need here 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.950
 power that does not make sense because 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.720
 I guess this one will leave here good 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.310
 try to do without this block but only 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.079
 good to place because as there is now if 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.459
 enter this block here does not have much 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.150
 meaning but good I'm going to place 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.069
 just in case 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.659
 is that I do not know if this should be like that 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.159
 although good arrived the same but now without 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.840
 problems therefore when seeing is is 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.920
 taking out parkour as you can so 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.329
 good without more guys I hope you like it 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.950
 this day of soria you know that you can command 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.019
 of your parkour maps to see is 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.890
 that there is a line together that dotcom does not 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.200
 you have the description 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.489
 two more back before four perfect and 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.720
 now I also have to record many 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.730
 many videos of the weekend because 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.260
 we are on thursday and touch record these 10 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.609
 videos that I wanted to see the weekend 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.319
 because I like I like to upload them and this 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.269
 it's a very cool jump that wants me 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.870
 fuck life between them will be 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.000
 perfect another jump of 4 ole 2020 over 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.379
 very slow solutions and the final mission 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 the ultimate mission and this surely 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.299
 you are watching it or Friday or Thursday not 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.799
 I know today Thursday right now but I want 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.950

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.970

 Friday that you enjoy the weekend 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.500
 as god sends 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.629
 this will be that it is a bit strange this does not 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.489
 because it's this from there not released anything 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.049
 that stairs and that those have 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.129
 final goes a little short and 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.630
 meanwhile let's enjoy the 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.250
 Mr. pixel art 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.810

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.150

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.380
 words now schukin sends greetings to 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.780
 Augustine and Argentinean skill a 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.460
 Augustine version top assert veils and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.710
 melina that if I'm not mistaken as we see 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.420
 he is only has a hair like 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.680
 now xq not to see to see how is the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.950
 pixel art 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.450
 hey he is very very cool is more I think 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.960
 that if I'm not wrong comes to the suit 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.560
 this to see to see that I look good leads 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.180
 the suit as I took it off 13 I think that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.280
 is the 2 as he had done in the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.810
 mail that takes as a black part and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.220
 carries the sides like a red thing 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.430
 what is it that leads whoever is in this 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.320
 missing site is that having done the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.460
 Keyblade This one is very cool but 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.200
 well the pixel anta has been very good 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.940
 I congratulate you is that you can put the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.440
 comments that appear and thought is 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.940
 I'm sorry because the map has been left 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.830
 short pre you know that a pair ass 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.420
 so it's usually short, but I'm going to 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.610
 try to bring the videos something else 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.580
 long since everything depends on my time 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.580
 and what you put something in there you hide 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.620
 over there you look now is that it gives me more 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.660
 also free to stay away from sona 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.830
 it arises but still more boys and 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.150
 I tell you that I hope you liked it and 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.890
 put something 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.650
 talk of curiosity I go away I 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.510
 enough for you to see it well cool 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.170
 I will try to improve the team 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.190
 sixto that's steve with a bow the shovel 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.130
 but he's already full of 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.320
 matches now, poor sir steve 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.890
 how they have made a skiff here 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.320
 the fire and carries is not strange either 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.850
 he covered all the other costumes he liked 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.590
 that we see a big reason 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.590
 gentlemen now and until the next
