00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
again now the only problem with that is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.490 
again now the only problem with that is

floated in still with

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.260 
floated in still with
maybe<00:00:57.329> he's<00:00:57.510> gonna<00:00:57.629> struggle<00:00:57.899> with<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:03.090> one

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
maybe he's gonna struggle with that one

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.070 
it hasn't quite got down spun that up so
it's<00:01:05.700> done<00:01:05.850> made<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.450> decision<00:01:06.900> but

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's done made the right decision but

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.530

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
thing Sam attacking the serve and then

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.960 
thing Sam attacking the serve and then
getting<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.100> fourth<00:02:54.340> ball<00:02:54.580> he<00:02:54.700> looks<00:02:54.880> very

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.520 

okay<00:02:59.400> sit<00:02:59.730> down<00:02:59.940> struggling<00:03:00.570> with<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.780> tries

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
okay sit down struggling with it tries

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.680 
okay sit down struggling with it tries
to<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.740> something<00:03:02.040> different<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.510> paid

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
to be something different but then paid

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.680 
to be something different but then paid
off<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.990> time<00:03:05.000> sound<00:03:06.000> from<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.240> keep<00:03:06.420> using

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
off that time sound from the keep using

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.050 
off that time sound from the keep using
it<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:10.310> think<00:03:11.310> what<00:03:11.430> happens<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> bit<00:03:11.850> more<00:03:12.000> in

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it I think what happens a bit more in

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.180 
it I think what happens a bit more in
this<00:03:12.210> game<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.600> dance<00:03:12.840> getting<00:03:13.380> more<00:03:13.620> backspin

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
this game is dance getting more backspin

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.490 
this game is dance getting more backspin
on<00:03:14.430> Sam's<00:03:14.940> topspin<00:03:15.390> serve<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.050> making<00:03:16.320> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
on Sam's topspin serve this is making it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.960 
on Sam's topspin serve this is making it
a<00:03:16.530> lot<00:03:16.620> more<00:03:16.680> difficult<00:03:17.190> for<00:03:17.370> sound<00:03:17.640> hit<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
a lot more difficult for sound hit the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:28.490 
a lot more difficult for sound hit the
third<00:03:18.180> ball<00:03:26.540> dan<00:03:27.540> gets<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.870> massive<00:03:28.140> shot

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
third ball dan gets a massive shot

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.080 
third ball dan gets a massive shot
coming<00:03:28.770> up<00:03:28.950> soon<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.340> they<00:03:29.460> ki<00:03:29.610> arise<00:03:29.880> out<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
coming up soon as they ki arise out of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.850 
coming up soon as they ki arise out of
that<00:03:32.540> right<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.780> that's<00:03:33.900> quite<00:03:34.170> typical<00:03:34.590> Sam

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
that right so that's quite typical Sam

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.740 
that right so that's quite typical Sam
so<00:03:35.100> he<00:03:35.190> gets<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.490> decent<00:03:35.610> shot<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.300> then<00:03:36.420> he

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
so he gets a decent shot but then he

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.180 
so he gets a decent shot but then he
assumed<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.470> not<00:03:37.590> going<00:03:37.710> to<00:03:37.800> come<00:03:37.950> back

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
assumed that it's not going to come back

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
assumed that it's not going to come back
and<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.030> when<00:03:39.150> done<00:03:39.360> does<00:03:39.570> returned<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.050> he's

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
and then when done does returned it he's

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.860 
and then when done does returned it he's
incredible<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:42.120> was<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.270> good<00:03:42.420> serve<00:03:42.660> that

all different spins get snapped that was

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:32.590 
all different spins get snapped that was
pretty<00:04:22.860> decent<00:04:23.010> serving<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.610> shot<00:04:23.760> by<00:04:23.910> Dan

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.580 

and<00:04:33.600> I'm<00:04:33.690> getting<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> little<00:04:34.200> bit<00:04:34.440> defensive

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
and I'm getting a little bit defensive

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.440 
and I'm getting a little bit defensive
in<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.220> game<00:04:35.460> since<00:04:35.820> we<00:04:36.060> just<00:04:36.210> trying<00:04:36.390> to

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
in this game since we just trying to

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:47.510 
in this game since we just trying to
kick<00:04:36.600> ball<00:04:36.870> on

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.930 

behind<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.640> think<00:04:48.670> could<00:04:49.000> have<00:04:49.090> attempted<00:04:53.940> she

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
behind I think could have attempted she

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.020 
behind I think could have attempted she
sounds<00:04:55.330> pretty<00:04:55.420> decent<00:04:56.490> serving<00:04:57.490> slap<00:04:57.820> by

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
sounds pretty decent serving slap by

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:06.090 
sounds pretty decent serving slap by
them<00:05:04.050> not<00:05:05.050> sure<00:05:05.200> what<00:05:05.380> Sam's<00:05:05.620> doing<00:05:05.770> there

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
but when they lift it up it's a decent

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.630 
but when they lift it up it's a decent

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
think he could kind of be done just by

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.809 
think he could kind of be done just by
pushing<00:06:29.020> but<00:06:29.919> that's<00:06:30.280> not<00:06:30.460> really<00:06:30.729> the<00:06:30.789> way

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
pushing but that's not really the way

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.219 
pushing but that's not really the way
that<00:06:30.940> we<00:06:31.090> want<00:06:31.360> in<00:06:31.449> this<00:06:31.509> place<00:06:34.229> definitely
