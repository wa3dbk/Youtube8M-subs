00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.070
 how important it is to select this 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.050
 piece face tone should you really go out 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.900

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.820
 faces when you see that she doesn't 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.800
 came up it seems to me it's terrible somehow 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.829
 even mean now especially when there is 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.449
 many different options and many different 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.129
 funds 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.260
 video about organizing your storage 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.239

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.090

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.530
 I lay out this little table and you notice 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.629
 some of you have written in the comments 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.579
 that I have quite a lot of such 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.070
 luxury cosmetics and it really is 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.470
 so because like any girl i love 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.220

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 of all interest and you understand that you 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.820
 can you afford something more 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.630
 expensive at an inexpensive price and therefore yes 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.780
 I buy these things sometimes 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.640
 pretty much more than not needed but it is not 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.759
 It means that I do not use any 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.159
 inexpensive makeup it is absolutely 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.409
 not so among my cosmetics is what 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.659
 what can be called 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.850
 pretty affordable for everyone including 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.950
 there school students and today me 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.710
 I would like to discuss with you topic 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.500
 how important it is to select correctly 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.299
 cosmetics and important to make it worth 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.090
 expensive so today we will be with you 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.310
 compare two creams at me 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 then one is lora mercy 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.149
 if I said correctly if 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.049
 wrong then please forgive me 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.810
 I was given it on March 8 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.820
 secret client and he approached me and I 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.170
 I think that he is cool but at the same time 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.119
 I sometimes use 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.509
 yet another foundation that already 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.899
 many years with me this is my ticket to off 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.360
 No, it is because I bought you in 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.459
 time 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 his studentship it was wrong 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.989
 for a long time but still it is him me too 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.360
 I have been checking a lot for myself 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.709
 like mad and belenok what they have 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.290
 so many shades 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.840
 they developed more than ten pieces for 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.050
 Russia stretched multinational and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.090
 There are many different skin types and website 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.830
 they can take a test that is 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.209
 determine your skin type here I chose 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.910
 Ivory 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.060
 pretty light tone but considering 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.549
 that skin seems pretty to me 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.269
 still light including me even 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.870
 fits 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.700
 although I'm not exactly a fair-haired girl, but I 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.060
 I tried it on myself and now I will tell 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.989
 how in general when you come to the store 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.420
 you see standing there in front of you a bunch 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.910
 cosmetics that usually offers you 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.160
 try on hand but it's wrong 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 because the skin on the hand and the skin on your 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.549
 his face is still different and then he 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.510
 time may manifest itself differently 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.209
 Moreover, there is still light there and then how 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.130
 lucky color can be fluorescent can 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.640
 be some kind of lamps that are bright warm 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.320
 and from this you face them 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.780
 Difficulties in finding the best cream 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.780
 so I suggest you test everything 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.590
 Statement on today I'll paint half 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.470
 persons one mobile and second lorre if 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 I can paint like that 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.840
 I usually offer this whole thing with a brush 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.670
 apply foundation home if you 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.970
 more convenient and as one of my friends says 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.459
 beautician that you can not fool your hands 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.440
 so either choose a brush or hands 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.480
 we ourselves take start kicking soon he 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.130
 a little more dense i mean i already 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.560
 I can compare them because 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:05.280
 quite a long time using the tester and 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 i will wear my hand to the right side 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.590
 start up 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.569
 all i'm lucky that my skin is pretty 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.940
 still good and i don't have any there 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.370
 rash say so but it's all for yourself 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.560
 understand the lifestyle of proper nutrition 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.230
 including on genetics and from the inside it 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.380
 the whole thing needs to be checked too 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.169
 so I love when there or creams 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.940
 pretty lighter chlorine 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.980
 quite dense in texture but when it 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.650
 lays down on the skin as if adjusted 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.990
 under the face and it does not feel 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:49.950
 what with no feeling of some though 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:53.130
 film on the face more redness on 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.889
 here is my natural cheek 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.830
 story if you want me and you about it 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.840
 tell you what to do in order to 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.389
 it didn't get worse because brewer 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.330
 my mom is also there i understand that u 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.460
 I might like to have it once so here I am 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.100
 you literally made a little bit of mine 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.280
 I do not need much and I am very pleased with how 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.580
 it looks on the second cheek I will demolish 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.900
 Meybellin cream which costs much 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.360
 cheaper than Laura they have a decent difference 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.310
 cost that's what i like about him 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.800
 for let's say so some daily 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.030
 uses that he is quite easy as 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.400
 Do you know what milk they do not need 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.470
 literally just a little bit for that 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.680
 to his time well, that's spread on 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.680
 face 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:49.240
 it is even easier to do with my hands here 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.390
 there I applied two creams with absolutely 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.220
 different pricing policies and both cool 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.770
 looks on my face that is i look 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.290
 on myself and here but here 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.230
 I do not see any significant difference 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.340
 so I always suggest you apply 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.580
 everything is there 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.700
 do not hesitate to come shop 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.710
 unpainted 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.180
 and try everything on yourself to the extreme 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.560
 a case can graft a napkin into me 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.260
 It seems any large space 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.200
 the store is already equipped with this you can 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.420
 wash your tone or a piece of your 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.550
 cheeks and try something different because 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.980
 that after all it is very important to pick 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.810
 imagine that tone that makes your skin 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.080
 diameter so that you have it 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.180
 that's wonderful and you like your 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.920
 reflection in the mirror because it's all 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.630
 you can listen to different bloggers 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.550
 they have different opinions about cosmetics 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.610
 but you need to test everything on yourself and 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.180
 generally would suggest you a little bit 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.430
 bear on you 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.100
 tonal cream go out into the daylight 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.080
 look in the mirror and see if 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.300
 you go somewhere with it because 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.370
 really have 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.040
 makeup for all sorts of filming for some 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.270
 photo shoots and there is no makeup when 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.340
 you must be really not 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.480
 made up but actually a little 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.370
 made up to here 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.490

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.390
 flaws and look beautiful and you 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.060
 happy with themselves 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.220
 This is the most important thing I really hope that 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.110
