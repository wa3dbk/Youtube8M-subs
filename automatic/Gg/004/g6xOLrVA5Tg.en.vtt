00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.980
 in these moments we will continue the study analyzing both kidneys both 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.869
 the left as the right and the first thing that has to call us 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 the attention is that these two retroperitoneal organs is not found 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.580
 distributed at the same height 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.460
 if we look we can see that the left kidney is located 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.330
 a little above the kidney 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.150
 and it's due to the presence of the right epic lobe 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.840
 this wolf what tactical right conditions 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.579
 what the right kidney 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.579
 I was displaced a little bit below 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.649
 if we observe 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:48.940
 both kidneys 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.620
 we will locate above them the 2 structures that are the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.079
 Kidney glands 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 that will be studied in the neuroendocrine system plot 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.249
 likewise if we read 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:06.370
 both one kidney and the other we can see that they have the shape of exeni luna 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.390
 externally they are ready 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.930
 but we have to differentiate two regions 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.759
 the external region 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.550
 that form the so-called cortical zone 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.960
 i the internal region that is the one named was a me last 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 we also locate this other structure 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 what is the so-called pelvis 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.710
 Of great importance is also the differences between the renal artery 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.420
 left and right and between the left renal vein and the right 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.330
 if we look we can see for example that the left kidney pain is of greater 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.040
 length than the right renal vein and this is due to the disposition of the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.380
 vena cava inferior her lateral 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.789
 rights of the body 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.069
 while the anton min right there is placed in the left position 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.170
 this conditions for example 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.600
 what the left renal artery is of minor 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.490
 smaller diameter 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.339
 what the artery 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.159
 renal 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.209
 right 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.849
 we will also have to locate this structure also this one had 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.749
 descending muscle 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.159
 what is twitter 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.020
 so much last tetiz I lose 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.689
 like the right ureter huguet are you going to be 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.130
 did this case the bladder 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.599
 of urine 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.129
 these ureters descended i reached the urinary bladder this structure is 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.209
 the so-called jica urine 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.739
 a structure with way to look 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.150
 in which we can find a superior face 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.979
 two side inferno sides both sides 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.089
 that are united in this region kessel bergés oberti c 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:57.079
 we also have a back face a bottom that is to be here 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.869
 in this posterior view we can locate the ureters that we 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:07.069
 they move urine from the kidneys and also these 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.780
 two 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.050
 structures these tubes in this case 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.979
 what are the vas deferens 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:14.929
 and in turn 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.889
 we will have here the seminal vesicles 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.489
 and locating below locate and masters in this case this structure 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.489
 rounded what is the prostate 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.459
 masters section 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.619
 we will be able to observe 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.539
 the inside of the bladder of the orinoco 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.769
 the pontificio hure internal ctral 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.299
 the prostate 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.899
 i the toy that is crossed this prostate 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.419
 in this image we can see a section where we are going to locate structures of the 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.539
 digestive system of women 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:55.029
 of the genital tract and the culinary apparatus 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.339
 behind, we can locate the rectum 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.449
 what ends with the anal canal 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.420
 in front 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.959
 locate and masters the vaginal orifice that will continue with this structure 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.819
 The pointer 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.009
 and in turn ahead locate and masters the hole join him externó 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.729
 the urethra the internal ctral healing orifice and the bladder of the urine where 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.499
 we could locate that top face 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.430
 the vertex one side quintero lateral 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 i the cougars fund 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:34.659
 unlike what happened with the digestive tract structures and 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:35.550
 urogenital 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.259
 of the woman here we have the structures of the male 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.469
 in such a way that we are going to vitalize 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:42.580
 the rector 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.469
 and the anal canal 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.830
 we go in this case to look at a higher level first than the bladder 

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:49.639
 of urine 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.219
 in agreement we will save the hole an internal portrait the urethra 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.110
 we play here that ends with the difficult one either with him or with the building 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.800
 jure trad externó 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 but also this urethra is divided into three parts 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:07.590
 the first portion is to be here 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.900
 which is the one that goes through 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.229
 the prostate being the juve after prostatic 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.979
 at this level we have the so-called membranous petra 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.889
 i the portion 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.410
 longer that is the spongy urethra that goes through the spongy body 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.690
 turn on this penis 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.960
 we would have to locate the body 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.620
