00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.630
 truth is that dying is a new country 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.189

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.800

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.660
 colonial country associated free state 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.189

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.340
 again so I come here where the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.029

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.199
 more flavor and more flavor every thing that 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.029

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.629
 say hello to a clinic with a kiss on the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:56.780

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:38.120
 it worries you most in the language of the language 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.950

 laughing out loud but what the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.440
 people ask us to use messages from 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.680
 text and then they go around laughing at 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.680

 negative runs from my state of 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.850
 account when I was in college and the 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.530
 way that everyone tells you to 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.660

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.230
 pile of layer on top but what happens if 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.230
