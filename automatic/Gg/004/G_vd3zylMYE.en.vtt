00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hello and welcome almost is for the mobile industry or one 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.880
 could even claim for the communication behavior of the whole world 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.910
 because yesterday was a historic day because exactly 15 years ago was the first time 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.949
 phoned with a mobile phone 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.949
 In the past, the sensation was taken for granted today 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.659
 Time for a new hype probably thought Steve Jobs and brought one 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.720
 Day before the birthday, his newest Apple Baby will be the iPhone in the US market 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.650
 For days, by the way, the American fans were not just dedicated to Apple 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.460
 yes, after the stores camped around as the first legendary all-rounder in 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.340
 to hold his hands and he is now their version 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.030
 For us, our colleague Dagmar Hovestädt has chosen to join the queue 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.320
 posed 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.770
 the countdown to the iPhone reached 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.450
 Mussa on Friday its high 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.600
 Everywhere you stood in line here in Hollywood called faces meet music 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 hear 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 under the all for one 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.789
 Mertesacker 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.890
 These phones are just hot who lives without a cell phone 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.610
 and often just the hottest 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.460
 Only a few hours separate these people from their three wives 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.510
 Eberl as the old the general debate and now comes the phone one 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.510
 Combination of music and telephony everything a secret from that there 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.090
 drinne ORCL here wants to be the first and say I just did not believe it 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.850
 Computers are for Kirch wants to buy two new funds and return them immediately 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.570
 sold more on eBay and craigslist i saw that they were for the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.420
 a thousand dollars can be sold to anyone 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.610
 The wheel he turns yesterday as the injured Enke that's my life 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.610
 I will change that every day priority 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.460
 the hype could not be bigger 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.090
 for Jason Snell of the magazine Merkur and flies not alone 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 clever marketing from Apple 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.030
 Tauer website Dollase Jazz Big a big part of the excitement comes along 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.659
 that no one has ever seen such a product and who is at fault 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.779
 also the mobile phone manufacturers and also the network operators 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.569
 anyone has their cell phone the year in which the innovations stopped because 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:08.969
 there have not been any for a long time 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:13.469
 or if then they were slow and not fun the iPhone sees 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.660
 just look like it's fun 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.210
 It unites everything, it looks good and you really feel like it 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.940
 Encheser Urchs Pröll is the proportion for unrest that does not use that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.940
 Ballack 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:34.230
 As far as rare in our short test, it was so exciting to carry $ 600 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.319
 the apprentice 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.269
 every customer is greeted with applause and clapping 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.300
 the Oscars 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.799
 on the other hand 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.079
 percent 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.259
 more 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.099
 but we can now finally take a look at the marvel and the fingers 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.039
 slide 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.229
 it really works as advertised 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.919
 in the old town the music comes as a list that you slide down with your finger 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.299
 If you hold the phone across the list turns into the old squad 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.829
 even more impressive is the video function, the videos only in 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.439
 Widescreen format plays 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.489
 that does not create an answer 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.489
 the quality of the picture is brilliant 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.739
 In Safari Browser, web surfing actually allows the whole 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.209
 Website to see 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.209
 zoom in and out of chambers with one touch of a finger 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.259
 everything intuitive 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.259
 and for iPhones also w-lan can be in good speed 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.319
 on the day of the us, there is no news for Europe 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.290
 He handed over the World Cup announcing that we will have the iPhone by the end of the year 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.930
 We also do not want to talk about Europe 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.459
 details 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.249
 Speaking of the iPhone is really a cell phone contacts in the address book 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.070
 also in a list by finger pressure to control 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.760
 and every contact you can call e-mail m or write SMS 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.609
 the mobile phone wants everything better 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.239
 not only has a big mouth 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.589
 there is something behind it 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.589
 a new mobile age seems to have begun 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.400
 continue like a rotten egg 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.040
 since then, the iPhone is a gigantic middle or maybe not at all 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.990
 Success will be 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.160
 One thing is clear the criteria for what a good phone is 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.450
 Everyone will benefit from it now, even if we change 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.430
 no apple product buys you will benefit because the phones in the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.720
 coming years will be significantly better because Apple has submitted as 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.590
 a dept 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.919
 By the way, the iPhone is activated and synchronized via the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.240
 itunes software 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.909
 on PC or Mac 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.909
 and that goes beyond not just the apple store 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.080
 and banks studied that today is not a collar Sony DADC have 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.150
 Hadamar EU 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.580
 in the synonymous reported why in your quarter about all sorts of cell phones and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.169
 Of course, on the iPhone as well, appreciate that in the newsroom of a 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.639
 the hype about the new apple baby really justified 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.059
 yes, I think this is really justified 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.309
 because now Apple takes the first time a product that does so well 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.080
 Like all humans, I am a cellphone 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.830
 and citizens, of course, the users expect what comes especially and that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.539
 iPhone 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.389
 Also a very special things can be less at the 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.509
 Telephone functions but in the operation 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.139
 People will be able to use iPhone just as they do in the normal world 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.719
 The physical world they deal with will be photos 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.490
 can push their lists with their fingers they will then by themselves 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.919
 continue to run 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.990
 it is also urgent that the thistle appearance changes these are all things 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.509
 which will make the handling of the device very very pleasant everything is ready 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.880
 Not only does it look good, it is also very user friendly 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.159
 then she still has some weak spots 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.129
 It can also be a few things not every normal cell phone can do 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.920
 can come and send that 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.920
 it has no UMTS at least in the American version 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.660
 and it is a closed system 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.480
 unlike most other phones, you can not do any extra 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.879
 Play software 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.219
 Going out to eat or to work is a real thing 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.559
 Restrictions now have to look how people can deal with it 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.529
 for alternatives to the iPhone 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.759
 There are two alternatives in Germany currently 2 phones which also have one on the 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.939
 Finger operation are designed 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.419
 the one is that 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.199
 Hilti Prada go 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.259
 There you also practice with your finger 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.930
 on the 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.199
 screens 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.389
 you can do everything with it but that is partly very nested menus 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.169
 and not really enjoyable to use alone also no express victory or salt 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.159
 after reach there really enough the finger HM 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.549
 the second alternative is the fact traces and 17 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.210
 that is a 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.810
 new device with windows mobile operating system from Microsoft so where did 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.119
 the CIA has put an extra user interface over it 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:46.719
 where to do it with your finger 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:49.589
 large buttons available has too much and here 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.479
 Florian Schick can pick from that is very chic 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.379
 but as soon as you do 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:59.009
 deeper into the minis, Compper goes back out at Microsoft and needs ideas 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.089
 Foundation has to click on all those small-scale things in a more complicated way 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.529
 is not really iPhone level alone not quite a number of competitors at 1 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:07.249
 and no 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:13.309
 at the details parade could be in Sindh Syed has hidden Säckinger percentages 

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.009
 the boys kindness is the future 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.050
 the executing middle class up to high-end equipment determines 

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:23.059
 that's the way people handle things, and so they want to be 

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.999
 Bypass technology 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.129
 they do not want to press different to small keys and repost in pen 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.740
 accuse 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.449
 they want to do something with their fingers 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.499
 as usual 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.889
 national standards as and Hessian on the waiting list yes clearly 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.199
 in addition to many thanks
