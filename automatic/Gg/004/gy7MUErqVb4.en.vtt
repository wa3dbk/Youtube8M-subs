 you click on download 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.909
 there is a little thing that will be displayed 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.500
 here to tell you that it makes such a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.420
 thing like that was the change in one 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 minute you put on it and it's going 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 open on the torrent and that's what 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 will start to settle down so that's going 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 last two hours even less it took 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.810

 it is here so the game the normal 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.180
 so you especially do not click here
