00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
into a microwave-safe dish and I'm going

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.410 
into a microwave-safe dish and I'm going

do<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.730> too<00:01:01.879> long<00:01:02.030> because<00:01:02.210> we<00:01:02.360> don't<00:01:02.510> want<00:01:02.659> to

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
do it too long because we don't want to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.200 
do it too long because we don't want to
burn<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.019> chocolate

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
and it really doesn't want to be any

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.500 
and it really doesn't want to be any
longer<00:01:10.250> than<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.549> we're<00:01:10.820> just<00:01:11.000> going<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.240> mix
