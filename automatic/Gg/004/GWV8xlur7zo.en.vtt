00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.859
 great so you understand today with us 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.200
 new video called review 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.389
 well blindly and today we are madly 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 cool caloto who won me over 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.670
 with your design so let's see 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.880
 what is it and this is our deck which 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 called infinite 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 as we see the deck is completely 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.269
 worked from scratch and really 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 worked on all 100 here 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.810
 a million different parts and that's it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 just looks impressive to the workers we have 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.149
 volume is all inscriptions different patterns 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.329
 we are sticking out the back of the box 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.590
 completely repeats the cards themselves shirt 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 cards on one side we have written 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.480
 infinite series and perfume skating here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 It is this performance of Katins that we have 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.129
 coating 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.440
 further we have printed balsa united state 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.020
 plain cards company this is where these 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 cards were printed below us 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.280
 everything is written about 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.530
 the illusionist is here to watch us especially 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.900
 nothing and let's go to the mouths 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.650
 Here we open to the workers here very 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.380
 beautifully drawn are you there though 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.299
 infinite and then we open the cards 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's go here this is our cards 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.250
 the first thing we see is two such 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 here is the fairest joker as we see 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.560
 they are completely identical and nothing superfluous 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.729
 i don't like them here 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.310
 go further it means we have 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.509
 design peak ace we see similarly 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.509
 inscription infinite series 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.939
 these are our twos and threes and fours that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.770
 I like the most in this deck 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.899
 this is what this deck was created 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.899
 completely from scratch i like some 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 cards for example the monarch there took faces from 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.290
 Deuces like the dozens as a conventional 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.540
 basic all standard 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.580
 here everything was worked out 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 0 suits the letter numbers of the faces of the cards is just 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.259
 really super ie we see nothing 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:18.660
 taken from the standard all design it 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:23.490
 very cool and spectacular here we see everything 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.070
 All card's jack lady king we 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.410
 we see nothing at all to take with 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.440
 standard and also still in this deck 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.600
 there is a feature with red cards here 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.900
 these are all our cards that have 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.959
 red color is our all bobby cards and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.450
 all the cards are peak they have such a very 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.330
 nice little reds too 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.250
 red like cherry and he like bronze 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.650
 overflows i.e. it is very very 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.739

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.200
