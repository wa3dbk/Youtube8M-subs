00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:14.009
 Hi, I 'm a fugue this time 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 As it is quite well received by comment that the recording method of vita 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.900
 Hey Well Iha of whether that little rough simplicity 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.110
 Well while keeping up with editing 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.829
 Yes I want to explain a bit 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.520
 Well like this or that First What you need it is the hdmi corresponding recording capture 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.010
 It is feeling 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.940
 I don't know what I am using 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.930
 It's really messy 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.800
 This is the times I'd not know whether would be helpful 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.970
 There is something like l with this kind of game capture hd 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.970
 Since this is a 9-inch 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:01:01.210
 I think that the new product has not been released so I put a page on ur 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:06.070
 I can do this here but I think I couldn't do the latest model 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.369
 I do not know the latest model, but this old model l and game capture i dag 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.320
 Nara will come to a little can also vita 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.040
 Informal or not 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 Yes Nde informal 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:24.450
 Maako vita tv b even though I say recordings from vita and vita 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.950
 It does not mean to connect the capture and record it like this with vita tpp 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.610
 Let me have it ready 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.159
 Well, it's just fine 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.740
 I wonder if it takes around 25,000, maybe 20,000 yen 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.299
 l has a head 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.130
 I think it was quite expensive because it was around 25,000 which was so bad in the village 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.850
 Yes 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 Well then a little bit more about 1 tv 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.580
 Well wait a little here and see a little here and here a little 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.740
 here 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.890
 Is it a red memory stick 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.520
 Holistic freshly made here 8 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.630
 For example Cho Wait a minute 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.090
 Great 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.120
 Screen wow 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.450
 Half why this 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.399
 Oh, hey 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.750
 We put game software here and do software projection without corresponding 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.150
 There is a software that is not compatible software 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.810
 I think that I can play most games, but there are a lot of software that I can not deal with 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.160
 Well fine 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.910
 It's limited but it's vita tv compatible game capture 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.950
 I will 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.810
 The number is the controller Oh here 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:37.040
 Since the usb cable Kana recently dualshock 4 is also made to the corresponding Maadi 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:41.269
 3 controllers height Playstation full shock 3 Re broken Nde 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.240
 Well, thank you very much for this hdmi cable 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.300
 I wonder if it looks like this 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.970
 lan cable This is a power cord Yes 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.400
 Maa like this 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.500
 Launch is fast and amazing 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.490
 Or rather Seijun 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.920
 Yes and the distributor this is pretty important 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:08.160
 I think maybe I can not do without this 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.050
 The distributor is that kind of hdcp 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.500
 There is something like security, yes 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:21.420
 8 It seems that there is nothing like this 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:26.790
 vita tv can be directly inserted via hdmi though 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:30.540
 In case of playstation 4 hg cp can be switched on / off 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.650
 But vita tv does not have such a function 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:40.109
 Well there is a little noise if there is no distributor 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:45.840
 Ballmer Well I is I do not have it so Well meaning is not deck and distributor to like this 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:50.530
 Well, what to be prepared for it eh TV are pretty I wonder if I'm on kana hdmi cable 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.080
 Connecting the distributor and the color play capture an attempt to 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.620
 Use of things 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.720
 Oh Chat Akky Oh Aa Tsutsu' 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:07.370
 After a little do in a couple oh well and after 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:11.659
 To the sound and Edo Ichi sa 123 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.850
 I think that 3 enter in Sarn crowded around Kana lowest 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.840
 Yes 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:22.860
 What to prepare is vita tb 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:25.290
 vita tv and yeah eh distribution key and Well a little known only in my capture 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.110
 There is not, but l type game capture hd 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:34.100
 I think maybe capture with hdmi cable compatible 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:40.510
 This is true indeterminate and high 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.510
 Well then it's a mess, but I would like to end with this Thank you for watching
