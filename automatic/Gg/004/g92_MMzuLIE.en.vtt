00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.610

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.839

 are link to the channel of subscribers is 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.530
 as always below in the description can 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.030
 But then quickly to the topic for 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.190
 I have one again today 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.799
 Quote found me really right 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.540
 like good and jan because you want to you 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.190
 So let's partake a bit 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.490
 I will read it out at the beginning 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.950
 it's friends are the lanterns on 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.460
 a long dark path they make him 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 not shorter but a little brighter and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.300
 I had to say that as read 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.360
 I thought so sensational 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.810
 there is so much truth in it that is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 yes even the best friend can give you one 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.890
 You do not lose weight 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 let's have to learn a life because 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.330
 yes in life there is not only here 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.850
 the nice pages no to the learning process 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.890
 in life it is also part of that 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.610
 Things may not experience them that way 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.480
 but are nice if you have friends 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.490
 counts one standing and one standing 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.040
 Give the man a stop then 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.360
 then you can also by such things 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.210
 maybe not alone on the whole 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.409
 be so good to bear it is 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.209
 is unfortunately so that you maybe 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.180
 Just a person needs 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.790
 to talk about such things 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.980
 Yes, and maybe that's it 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.019
 most important thing too 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.540
 friendship that makes you over 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.390
 things can talk without you being there 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.370
 somehow 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.850
 the fears must have that of 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.740
 other laughs on off or whatever 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.720
 It's important to be a person 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.569
 So at least one person has in life 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.970
 yes, where you can be like this 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.170
 is the man does not have to play the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.040
 you can say everything 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.230
 and yes I think that will do the same 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.660
 true friendship and that can 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.660
 the one stop the way then in the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.790
 make this quote brighter and there is 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.150
 then directly the question for today 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.580
 you have such a person in 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.709
 your life or are that even several 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.980
 or do you think this is all here 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.959
 absolute sentimental nonsense and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.989
 You do not need anything like that and you go 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.970
 like chuck norris live through and 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.040
 friendship and such is totally 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.480
 overrated 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.550
 Just write me that in the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.310
 comments purely would interest me 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.860
 as you all there so see otherwise 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.850
 You see, the gameplay is like that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.230
 well finished as there is the last enemy 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.810
 now has not knives then works 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.060
 stop with the piste but I have to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.230
 get end for this and comments 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.610
 say it as often as I do 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.610
 Hope you see you again 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.599
 on the achievement
