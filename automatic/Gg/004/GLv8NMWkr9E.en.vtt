hi<00:00:00.149> guys<00:00:00.390> so<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> went<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.680> pedo<00:00:01.920> box<00:00:02.190> today

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi guys so I went to the pedo box today

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.780 
hi guys so I went to the pedo box today
and<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.419> got<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.689> package<00:00:04.200> from<00:00:04.470> Korea<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.430> I

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
and I got a package from Korea so I

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.909 
and I got a package from Korea so I
figured<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.779> since<00:00:06.810> it's<00:00:07.259> from<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:07.620> far<00:00:07.799> away

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
figured that since it's from so far away

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.020 
figured that since it's from so far away
I<00:00:08.309> would<00:00:08.670> unbox<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:10.200> film<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.099> hopefully

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I would unbox it on film and hopefully

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.930 
I would unbox it on film and hopefully
there's<00:00:12.840> no<00:00:13.019> bombs<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.710> because<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
there's no bombs in here because in the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.859 
there's no bombs in here because in the
title<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.389> says<00:00:15.599> gabion<00:00:16.320> -<00:00:17.310> gun<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.510> there

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
title it says gabion - gun so there

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
title it says gabion - gun so there
might<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.199> gun<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.279> might<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.820> go

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
might be a gun here and it might just go

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
might be a gun here and it might just go
off<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.390> me<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:21.810> um<00:00:21.990> yeah<00:00:22.619> let's<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.100> what
