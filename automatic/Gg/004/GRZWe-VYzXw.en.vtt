00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.799 
supposed to be the Eiffel Tower but put
them<00:00:56.280> all<00:00:56.460> together<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:57.660> they

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
them all together just to see how they

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.970 
them all together just to see how they
would<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> way<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
would look and I kind of like the way it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
would look and I kind of like the way it
came<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> little<00:00:59.820> different<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
came out it's a little different but I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.189

can<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.260> everything<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.460> go

the<00:02:01.860> way<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> came<00:02:02.280> out<00:02:02.460> usually<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:03.240> tuck<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the way it came out usually your tuck is

on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> outside<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> ended<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:05.880> doing<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
