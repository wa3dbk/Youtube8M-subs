00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.890
 hello everyone here again with isma 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
 have a new video we find today 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.540
 here in a new video of passwords of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.860
 one smokes and I come light and shadow 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.440
 us why we are here today in my 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.369
 foam and lenin go game and we 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.990
 we are heading now in the part of 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.280
 corrections to put the four things 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.559
 between new signs that have gone up 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.200
 to the internet and they are three super technical 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.640
 and a new spirit warrior people 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.950
 interesting and we'll see it now 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.420
 let's put the passwords the first 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.100
 of all is the second super technique 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.020
 block that many will know that the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.449
 has the ball danger is called spectrum 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.430
 dark so let's her the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:57.489
 this password is 8 uppercase n this 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:04.720
 I think it was an oms and a 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:07.900
 l a w a s a n but not a l was not 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.409
 one and capital letter forgives because they are usually 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.230
 confuse a lot to see a small and a 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.680
 X 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:22.440
 it is not serious either 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.830
 to see if it has to be an uppercase 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.960
 Well, take not 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.850
 let's see I'll try again with a 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.130
 the minuscule time 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.680
 look now if it was a tiny l 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.110
 forgiven for the confusion is that I read 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.560
 a little bit with my letter is that I have 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.180
 a little bit of power 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.009
 true but look we have a room 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 with dark-looking residents we're going 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.330
 now with the consequent super technique 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.570
 that is called aragon's tail that 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.430
 It is super shooting technique of origin of 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 type fires and that we're going to do it the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.180
 correction is yes 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.740
 I think this is an I think it is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.810
 one l then we go back to compare 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.450
 repeat it because it's usually a bit 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.660
 difficult the truth identify them want 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.009
 a letter that does not give us this I think it 's 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.880
 one op 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.290
 yes I think it's a j or a 18 and a p 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.770
 capital letter 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.560
 it's not worth then that l think it's one and 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.840
 capital letter is but had not put as 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.600
 in key elements with a lower case one 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:35.740
 I'm going to put one of a wait 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:40.070
 and so one or a j 18 and a capital p 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.500
 neither the improvements seriously so this goes 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.860
 to be a zero I'm confusing 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.720
 watch 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.520
 is that in the end I think we are going to commit 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.460
 more freaks than passwords we're going to 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.850
 get so fuck you do not either 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:58.260
 I understand to see and capital letter to see if it is 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.800
 that's an efe or a a capital letter 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.860
 obviously one or capital letter has to be 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.890
 a j 18 and a p 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.160
 now yes without forgiving forgive 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.730
 Attentive attentive as I have done before 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.410
 if you do not repeat the video again and you're 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.210
 simply that 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.950
 forgive guys let's come with the next 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.350
 password that is a super technical 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.090
 dribble call followed giant not what 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.130
 I know either but let's go there we're going to 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.780
 get it worth the password 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.320
 let's see if we also make it 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.930
 no mistake we are going to see an ere an effe 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.240
 I think it is a capital and the often 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.060
 confuse a lot 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:45.130
 1919 one faith one five witnesses fusing 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.390
 I shit on everything to see a 4 one and I do not know 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.440
 if it's capital case after 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.200
 we will try a 3 and a v if these are 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.310
 perfect perfect perfect perfect 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.700
 various we have another password more in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.860
 our arsenal and now we're going for the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.220
 more important that of a spirit 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.739
 warrior that is called crack with that is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.050
 a warrior spirit although although 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.220
 cheating but it's pretty strong let's 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.040
 see that yes one of a tiny one m 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.840
 upper case 3 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.229
 I think this is a capital zeta 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:26.530
 sign that is capitalized one h 1 816 a 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.870
 lowercase zeta and an uppercase a 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.750
 I think that if not then I think it's a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.330
 zero, yes, it is a perfect zero 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.919
 Well then, these are the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.150
 four passwords that come at the moment 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.310
 yes we go to the game 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.940
 and we are going to get them simply by 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.180
 see how they are so let's go out 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.139
 we continue 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.160
 and we go to get the people 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.830
 it looks like you but it was that 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.960
 starting with a few games in 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.009
 my team because I plan not to learn a 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.900
 new super technique that I want that 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.639
 learn and do not know to see what the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.220
 last if some the with the last super 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.440
 technique of the plan I chose please to me 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.330
 tell the truth I need to know what 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.350
 we signed to it we go in to 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.750
 institute because that 's where it's 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.900
 will find all the super techniques that 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.919
 we need so we're going to here to this 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.229
 seÃ±orito here to see how it goes if 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:22.820
 you're alone dark spectrum go let's go 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.949
 buy 363 let's catch the pigtails of the 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.979
 dragon let's take one road in case 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:32.240
 perhaps you never know and the giant seal 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.320
 let's catch keep perfect vale no 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.789
 we are missing nothing more 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:42.289
 these are the objects that you have obtained 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:44.630
 for wifi the truth that at the moment 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.710
 one part we go now by 9-4 spirit 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.740
 warrior let's see the information 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.389
 we go to the tower 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.650
 of I suppose as we have to do a 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.319
 warrior spirit we have to go another 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.150
 time to the tower to the uncle this they give us 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.880
 the natives that makes us 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.770
 invoker is I think let's put to see 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.449
 what does it say 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.069
 I feel a devastating energy 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.750
 coming from the warrior spirits 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.849
 you can see that you have worked in cove 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.470
 that you work hard as a reward 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.849
 grant a new power and continue 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.849
 fleet struggling to the fullest 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.910
 ground there is our new spirit 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.940
 crown warrior pardoning the face with 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.680
 it was worth it let's stop we 're going to 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.910
 leave it here good let's see the 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.289
 warrior spirit to see how 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.690
 myself yes all successfully to see 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.280
 the information for all the spirits 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.289
 warriors that I have I do not have many the 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.280
 true but in the end they are something better than 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.970
 nothing 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.970
 in dragon let's see 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:49.980
 vale garage here is god what chulada 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:54.760
 Uncle look, look how is it is that looking 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:56.710
 this one and I 'm going to put it in my 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.860
 team like that called me and I'm concerned you 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.720
 I swear we will finally see has to be 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.180
 a spirit of fire is a mysterious 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.650
 inhabitant of another dimension of goalkeeper 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.500
 It is worth having the super technique of 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.870
 call crimson dome or if that 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.810
 we want you to try it and we have the the 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.070
 always death talent improve the 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.680
 players' abilities when they go 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.760
 losing a party and power of spirit 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.760
 blacksmith 10 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:31.220
 they give us a warrior spirit for 

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:33.170
 password and they have 10 of power 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.480
 I honestly do not know what to say the truth 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.130
 I do not know honestly I think finally 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.150
 I want it to be good because of the super 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.070
 technique 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.490
 I would say that still in physics is good 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.870
 because until now I would say that this 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.690
 this is all the truth the passwords 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.540
 we will see the super techniques 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.760
 in the next game so so 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.530
 we leave the video here I hope that I have 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.940
 liked a lot and fruits distributed from 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.250
 very useful irony these 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.870
 passwords you can let him comment 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.240
 subscribed all of you want and we 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.970
 We will see soon more videos more 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.890
 passwords more matches and much more like that 

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:11.380
 let's come guys a greeting from amateurs 

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.380
 here now and always goodbye
