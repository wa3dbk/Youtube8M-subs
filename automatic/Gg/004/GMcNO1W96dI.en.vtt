00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
free the marines now so where Peter and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.789 
free the marines now so where Peter and
Richthofen<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.670> both<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.119> brooked<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:37.140> while

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
Richthofen are both at brooked now while

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.560 
Richthofen are both at brooked now while
there<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> four<00:01:38.880> Marines<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.390> my

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
there we see the four Marines now my

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
there we see the four Marines now my
theory<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.770> theory<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
theory this is just my theory is that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
theory this is just my theory is that
Dempsey<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> Marines<00:01:42.899> i'm<00:01:43.079> pretty

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
Dempsey is one of the Marines i'm pretty

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
Dempsey is one of the Marines i'm pretty
sure<00:01:43.890> Dempsey's<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.610> marines<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.689> he<00:01:46.259> was

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
sure Dempsey's one marines now he was

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.929 
sure Dempsey's one marines now he was
one<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.860> four<00:01:47.100> Marines<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> might<00:01:47.790> not

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
one of the four Marines you might not

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.639 
one of the four Marines you might not
know<00:01:48.210> which<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
know which one he is but he is

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
know which one he is but he is
definitely<00:01:49.920> most<00:01:50.670> doubt<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.390> mind<00:01:51.600> he<00:01:51.899> is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
definitely most doubt in my mind he is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
definitely most doubt in my mind he is
definitely<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> married<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.700> while<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.180> there

no numa Richthofen kills Peter either

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.059 
no numa Richthofen kills Peter either
because<00:03:07.669> he<00:03:07.819> knows<00:03:08.060> he's<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.419> spy<00:03:08.780> or<00:03:09.139> because

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
because he knows he's a spy or because

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.710 
because he knows he's a spy or because
he<00:03:10.189> knows<00:03:10.370> something's<00:03:10.849> funny<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.510> guy

he knows something's funny with this guy

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.640 
he knows something's funny with this guy
so<00:03:12.010> he<00:03:13.010> either<00:03:13.280> he<00:03:13.819> kills<00:03:14.120> him<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.480> instead<00:03:15.079> of

so he either he kills him and instead of

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.649 
so he either he kills him and instead of
showing<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.639> it<00:03:16.760> was<00:03:16.849> him<00:03:17.060> who<00:03:17.239> killed<00:03:17.540> him

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
showing that it was him who killed him

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.140 
showing that it was him who killed him
he<00:03:18.260> hung<00:03:18.590> him<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:19.489> he<00:03:19.519> put<00:03:19.729> a<00:03:19.760> parachute

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
he hung him but then he put a parachute

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.509 
he hung him but then he put a parachute
so<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.599> looked<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.959> mishap<00:03:21.440> occurred<00:03:21.799> now
