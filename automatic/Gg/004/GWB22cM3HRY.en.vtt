00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.890 
my kick over I use my left leg to kick
and<00:03:30.530> my<00:03:31.530> right<00:03:31.800> leg<00:03:31.830> goes<00:03:32.250> over<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:33.750> not

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
and my right leg goes over so I'm not

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.330 
and my right leg goes over so I'm not

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
sure if that's the same for everyone

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.310 
sure if that's the same for everyone
else<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.150> what<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.690> for<00:03:36.810> me

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
let's get on with the instructions so

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.220 
let's get on with the instructions so
first<00:03:53.340> for<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:53.610> 'native<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.050> after<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.140> know

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
first for to 'native is after you know

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.290 
first for to 'native is after you know
how<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.100> basic<00:03:56.400> backbone<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:57.150> I

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
how to do the basic backbone which I

how to do the basic backbone which I
kind<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.810> taught<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.140> you're<00:03:59.100> going<00:03:59.250> to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
kind of just taught you you're going to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.090

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
back then another way to bridge is to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
back then another way to bridge is to
lift<00:04:08.850> your<00:04:08.940> arm<00:04:09.150> up<00:04:09.360> move<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.780> around<00:04:10.310> put<00:04:11.310> that
