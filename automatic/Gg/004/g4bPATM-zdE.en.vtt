00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:10.290
 40-year-old spirit that pachinko can not stop 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:16.940
 We come back to the public losing to go to pachinko, if there is spare time 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:22.090
 I think to quit many times but will carry over time and also the foot every time you lose 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:27.350
 Is it better to have a doctor see if it is addictive ? 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:33.710
 We talked about what you did not save 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:36.200
 Yes, it may be an addiction, depending on whether it is an addiction or an addiction . 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.680
 That way 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.390
 Apart Kedomo are you comment also flows though I might I wonder what addiction is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.350
 I do not mind but 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.730
 that 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.949
 You don't have to go to pachinko separately for debts with money you earned 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.430
 You are not doing pachinko using all earned money in I want to get married in this state 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.430
 He says he is troubled with saving money 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.470
 I can not get married because I can not stop pachinko 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:13.030
 I think I can not say that I can not marry because I can not save money 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.660
 When I say why, I think of it as time to double as this 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.720
 I can not stop the net , but I can not stop the twitter but I do 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.530
 I can't stop the game, but I think it's a similar problem 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.729
 Look at the net if there is time in 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.150
 Gone is the will to do was go and in freedom deer free time in this state it away 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.600
 End up 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.270
 There is no time to translate time and money 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.960
 Since it is would be anyone and also can not even love you do not encounter also a new marriage after all 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.340
 not 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 Is not it almost the same as well as the trouble you have is we own and ends up in Fu say so 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.990
 A pachinko and is Gann 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.320
 Are we since have become the wind Tteyuu pool whether money in the eyes from above you that it's addiction 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 But when we say such a thing, we are all addicts, right? 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:01.079
 Well then , I have no problem in my life if I have to get rid of it because it is addictive. 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.540
 This person unless otherwise Kedomo I think that is better is you have lost agent addiction is pachinko 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.400
 Already 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.929
 I really like it so I think it's fine I just want to marry that single 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.640
 If it is a person who likes pachinko as much I think it is better to be her 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.630
 I'm so fond of pachinko, but it 's a pride to say I'm not doing any debt at all 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.740
 bring it with you 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:26.320
 Lunde I think good to Tteyuu life to live up to quit that favorite thing Ya Hayao Miyazaki 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.870
 It is from Tomino Yoshiyuki not even have Detsu 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.880
 Create a savings quit pachinko not not you wish I gone I that is as it is 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.620
 Also Kedomo words is bad 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.620
 I am honest when marriage approaches 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620
