00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
by this discovery is that there are many

that<00:00:46.649> can't<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.160> seen<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.899> looked<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that can't be seen so they looked at the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
that can't be seen so they looked at the
center<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> Milky<00:00:50.190> Way<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.910> found

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
center of the Milky Way and they found

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
center of the Milky Way and they found
around<00:00:51.420> 10<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.320> extrapolated

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
around 10 of these and they extrapolated

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
around 10 of these and they extrapolated
how<00:00:53.250> many<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.579> must<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.969> over<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.660> entire

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
how many there must be over the entire

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
how many there must be over the entire
galaxy<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.739> these<00:00:56.219> guys<00:00:56.399> estimate<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
galaxy and these guys estimate that

galaxy and these guys estimate that
there<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.809> twice<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.379> many<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.859> as

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
there are about twice as many of them as

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.510 
there are about twice as many of them as
there<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.430> stars<00:00:59.460> in<00:01:00.590> addition<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:02.160> worlds

there are stars in addition these worlds
are<00:01:02.640> thought<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.180> least<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.629> common<00:01:03.960> as

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
are thought to be at least as common as

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
are thought to be at least as common as
planets<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.619> orbit<00:01:04.799> stars<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> add<00:01:06.030> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
planets that orbit stars so you add up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.580 
planets that orbit stars so you add up
all<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> stars<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> galaxy<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.380> all<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
all the stars in the galaxy and all the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.830 
all the stars in the galaxy and all the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
planets that orbit stars and that would

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
planets that orbit stars and that would
add<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.350> hundreds<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> billions<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.729> these

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
add up to hundreds of billions of these

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
add up to hundreds of billions of these
lone<00:01:12.479> planets<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.290> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> wandering

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
lone planets just kind of wandering
around<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.610> galaxy<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> survey<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.290> not

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
around the galaxy so the survey is not

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260

stars in a galaxy so the discovery of

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.340 
stars in a galaxy so the discovery of
ten<00:02:25.920> free-floating<00:02:26.850> Jupiter's<00:02:27.390> supports<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
ten free-floating Jupiter's supports the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.960 
ten free-floating Jupiter's supports the
ejection<00:02:28.650> scenario<00:02:29.220> though<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.580> possible

ejection scenario though it's possible

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.150 
ejection scenario though it's possible
that<00:02:30.090> both<00:02:30.330> ways<00:02:30.660> are<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:30.960> play<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.040> this

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
that both ways are in play here but this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.830 
that both ways are in play here but this
discovery<00:02:32.670> sort<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.970> implies<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.270> these

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
discovery sort of implies that these

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.390 
discovery sort of implies that these
were<00:02:33.990> planets<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.530> are<00:02:34.590> rejected<00:02:35.130> the

reason<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> supports<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.810> scenario<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
reason it supports that scenario is that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.950 
reason it supports that scenario is that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
stars in other words they just formed it

coalesced<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.380> gas<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.800> dust<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.790> they

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
coalesced out of gas and dust then they

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.550 
coalesced out of gas and dust then they

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
would have only expected to have seen

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.080 
would have only expected to have seen
one<00:02:46.830> or<00:02:46.950> two<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.250> those<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> survey

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
one or two of those in the survey

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.570 
one or two of those in the survey
instead<00:02:48.720> they<00:02:48.870> found<00:02:48.900> 10<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.680> they<00:02:50.130> base<00:02:50.550> it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
instead they found 10 and they base it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.010 
instead they found 10 and they base it
on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> relative<00:02:51.330> rate<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.840> star<00:02:51.960> formation

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
on the relative rate of star formation

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.260 
on the relative rate of star formation
and<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:52.710> how<00:02:52.890> often<00:02:53.400> these<00:02:53.550> these<00:02:54.030> gas

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
and then how often these these gas

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.560 
and then how often these these gas
clouds<00:02:55.170> coalesce<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.150> results

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
clouds coalesce like this so the results

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.420 
clouds coalesce like this so the results
suggest<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.170> planetary<00:02:58.800> systems<00:02:59.190> often

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
suggest that planetary systems often

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.640 
suggest that planetary systems often
become<00:02:59.880> unstable<00:03:00.240> with<00:03:00.960> planets<00:03:01.470> being

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
become unstable with planets being

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.590 
become unstable with planets being
kicked<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.190> from<00:03:02.700> their<00:03:02.850> places<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.300> birth

kicked out from their places of birth

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.840 
kicked out from their places of birth
now<00:03:04.350> one<00:03:04.590> thing<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.830> these<00:03:05.130> observations<00:03:05.700> do

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
now one thing that these observations do

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.850 
now one thing that these observations do
not<00:03:06.090> rule<00:03:06.360> out<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.020> possibility<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
not rule out is the possibility that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.590 
not rule out is the possibility that
some<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.340> these<00:03:08.430> planets<00:03:08.940> may<00:03:09.120> have<00:03:09.330> very

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
some of these planets may have very

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.480 
some of these planets may have very

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that sort of scenario are pretty rare so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.010 
that sort of scenario are pretty rare so
no<00:03:23.430> one<00:03:23.550> now<00:03:23.670> think<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.210> thinking<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.840> these

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
no one now think is thinking that these

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.200 
no one now think is thinking that these

out<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:51.000> me<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.120> mercury<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.750> actually<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.290> a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
out to me that mercury is actually in a

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.100 
out to me that mercury is actually in a
3-2<00:03:53.040> orbit<00:03:53.520> resonance<00:03:53.940> which<00:03:54.090> means<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.450> for

3-2 orbit resonance which means that for

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.050 
3-2 orbit resonance which means that for
every<00:03:55.170> three<00:03:55.710> times<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.250> rotates<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.910> goes

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
every three times it rotates it goes

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.390 
every three times it rotates it goes
around<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.570> Sun<00:03:57.660> twice<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.710> it<00:03:58.860> has<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.010> very

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
around the Sun twice so it has a very

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.850 
around the Sun twice so it has a very
very<00:03:59.520> long<00:03:59.940> day<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.630> day<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.200> mercury<00:04:01.560> which<00:04:01.710> is

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
very long day a day on mercury which is

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.740 
very long day a day on mercury which is
the<00:04:01.980> time<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.370> takes<00:04:02.400> for<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.910> Sun<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.420> rise

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the time it takes for the Sun to rise

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.530 
the time it takes for the Sun to rise
and<00:04:04.080> set<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.500> go<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.770> way<00:04:04.800> around<00:04:05.540> takes

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and set and go all the way around takes

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.790 
and set and go all the way around takes
about<00:04:07.310> 176<00:04:08.310> earth<00:04:09.000> days<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:10.110> it's<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.320> very<00:04:10.350> long

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
about 176 earth days so it's a very long

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.590 
about 176 earth days so it's a very long
day<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:11.250> takes<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.520> long<00:04:11.700> time<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.360> Sun<00:04:12.570> to

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
day it takes a long time for the Sun to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.050 
day it takes a long time for the Sun to
actually<00:04:13.050> rise<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.500> set<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.850> does

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
actually rise and set but it does

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.729 
actually rise and set but it does
actually<00:04:15.390> rise<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.960> set<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.350> had<00:04:16.590> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
actually rise and set so I had that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.900 
actually rise and set so I had that
incorrect<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.400> thank<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.730> guys<00:04:17.850> for

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
incorrect and thank you guys for

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670 
incorrect and thank you guys for
correcting<00:04:18.510> me<00:04:18.600> well<00:04:19.049> that's<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.410> for<00:04:19.530> now

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
correcting me well that's it for now
