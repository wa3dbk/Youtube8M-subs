it's nice yeah so I mean the biggest

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.520 
it's nice yeah so I mean the biggest
thing<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.820> works<00:02:13.030> pretty<00:02:13.270> well<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.170> I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
thing is it it works pretty well so I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.620 
thing is it it works pretty well so I
guess<00:02:14.770> on<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> cons<00:02:15.610> if<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
guess on to the cons if that's the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.830 
guess on to the cons if that's the
that's<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.080> part<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:19.390> kind<00:02:19.750> of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
that's the part that is kind of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.490 
that's the part that is kind of
unfortunate<00:02:20.230> first<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.950> wanted<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> say<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
unfortunate first I wanted to say the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.720 
unfortunate first I wanted to say the
con<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.850> little<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.530> collar<00:02:32.890> is

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
con is this little this this collar is

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.330 
con is this little this this collar is
just<00:02:34.330> hard<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.050> small<00:02:35.470> dog<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.800> mean<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.160> is

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
just hard for a small dog I mean this is

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340 
just hard for a small dog I mean this is
about<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.150> smallest<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.200> some

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
about the smallest to do this for some

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.440 
about the smallest to do this for some
reason<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:39.459> can<00:02:39.670> tighten<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.330> won't

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
reason you can tighten it but it won't

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.830 
reason you can tighten it but it won't
stay<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.930> tight<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.860> some<00:02:42.040> reason<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.840> guess

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
stay that tight for some reason I guess

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.540 
stay that tight for some reason I guess
you<00:02:43.959> could<00:02:44.110> cut<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.410> off<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.130> don't<00:02:45.370> want

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
you could cut this off but I don't want

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.240 
you could cut this off but I don't want
anything<00:02:45.790> flailing<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.110> keep<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.800> want<00:02:48.130> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
anything flailing and I keep I want to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.449 
anything flailing and I keep I want to
keep<00:02:48.430> rescuing<00:02:48.820> dogs<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.320> think<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:51.160> will

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
keep rescuing dogs and I think this will

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.400 
keep rescuing dogs and I think this will
stand<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> test<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.269> time<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:53.140> don't<00:02:53.290> really

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
stand the test of time so don't really

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.600 
stand the test of time so don't really
want<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.680> cut<00:02:53.860> us<00:02:54.040> off<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.489> guess<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:56.489> guess<00:02:57.489> I

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
want to cut us off I guess I guess I

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.640 
want to cut us off I guess I guess I
really<00:02:57.910> could<00:02:58.120> replace<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.500> just

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
really could replace it but it's just

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.100 
really could replace it but it's just
not<00:02:59.799> like<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.250> Bert<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.269> that's<00:03:01.660> kind<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.989> a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
not like that Bert so that's kind of a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.090 
not like that Bert so that's kind of a
fail<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.989> doesn't<00:03:05.049> hold<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.920> much

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
fail it doesn't hold that much

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.720 
fail it doesn't hold that much
citronella<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.209> which<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
citronella in here which it's it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.539 
citronella in here which it's it
shouldn't<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.299> mean<00:03:10.600> really<00:03:11.410> if<00:03:11.799> your<00:03:12.130> dog<00:03:12.280> gets

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
shouldn't I mean really if your dog gets

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.390 
shouldn't I mean really if your dog gets
the<00:03:12.850> idea<00:03:13.269> it's<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.019> big<00:03:14.230> deal<00:03:14.410> but<00:03:14.890> my<00:03:15.190> dog

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
the idea it's not a big deal but my dog

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
the idea it's not a big deal but my dog
doesn't<00:03:16.440> he's<00:03:17.730> he<00:03:18.730> has<00:03:18.970> some<00:03:19.239> issues<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.560> he

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
doesn't he's he has some issues so he

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.660 
doesn't he's he has some issues so he
doesn't<00:03:21.130> get<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.820> idea<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:23.430> remember<00:03:24.430> at<00:03:24.519> day

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
doesn't get the idea and remember at day

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.210 
doesn't get the idea and remember at day
to<00:03:24.730> day<00:03:25.000> he<00:03:25.239> kind<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.630> has<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.840> learn<00:03:26.230> every<00:03:26.980> day

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
to day he kind of has to learn every day

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.420 
to day he kind of has to learn every day
so<00:03:28.000> with<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.480> dog<00:03:28.630> like<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.870> um<00:03:29.320> it's<00:03:30.280> just

bridge<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.690> haven't<00:04:03.050> tried<00:04:03.200> every<00:04:03.530> single

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
bridge and I haven't tried every single

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.370 
bridge and I haven't tried every single
brand<00:04:04.130> out<00:04:04.400> there<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:09.140> only<00:04:09.200> one

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
brand out there but this is the only one

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.370 
brand out there but this is the only one
that<00:04:09.440> seems<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:10.250> work<00:04:10.430> with<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:12.110> tried

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
that seems to work with that we tried

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.060 
that seems to work with that we tried
the<00:04:12.530> pet<00:04:13.160> safe<00:04:13.430> spray<00:04:14.090> control<00:04:14.620> which<00:04:15.620> smells

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
the pet safe spray control which smells

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.860 
the pet safe spray control which smells
really<00:04:16.280> nice<00:04:16.459> smells<00:04:16.790> like<00:04:16.850> lemon<00:04:17.299> which<00:04:17.480> I

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
really nice smells like lemon which I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.120 
really nice smells like lemon which I
really<00:04:18.680> enjoy<00:04:18.920> but<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:20.480> nozzle<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.470> actually

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
really enjoy but the nozzle is actually

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.970 
really enjoy but the nozzle is actually
bigger<00:04:22.400> than<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:23.510> where<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.290> beautiful<00:04:24.860> and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
bigger than the where the beautiful and

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.190 
bigger than the where the beautiful and
for<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.220> bark<00:04:25.460> collar<00:04:25.730> it's<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.540> same<00:04:26.780> it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
for the bark collar it's the same it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.930 
for the bark collar it's the same it
looks<00:04:27.440> exactly<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.980> same<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.460> everything<00:04:28.640> as

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
looks exactly the same and everything as

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.490 
looks exactly the same and everything as
far<00:04:29.090> as<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.450> nozzle<00:04:29.810> knows<00:04:29.930> that's<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.260> first

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
far as the nozzle knows that's the first

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.680 
far as the nozzle knows that's the first
time<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.710> checked<00:04:30.980> in<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:31.220> store<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:31.820> then<00:04:32.570> we

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
time I checked in this store but then we

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.990 
time I checked in this store but then we
brought<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.050> home<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.980> try<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.370> fill<00:04:34.880> it

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
brought it home and you try to fill it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.550 
brought it home and you try to fill it
up<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.450> just<00:04:35.480> sprays<00:04:35.870> everywhere<00:04:36.260> out<00:04:36.470> of

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
up and it just sprays everywhere out of

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.080 
up and it just sprays everywhere out of
the<00:04:36.650> sides<00:04:36.890> yeah<00:04:37.220> there's<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.580> little<00:04:37.910> tight

the sides yeah there's a little tight

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.140 
the sides yeah there's a little tight
connection<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.890> it's<00:04:40.610> probably<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:40.970> worst

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
connection and it's probably the worst

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.710 
connection and it's probably the worst
thing<00:04:41.530> these<00:04:42.530> if<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.310> find<00:04:43.550> them<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:43.820> Petsmart

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
the little guy he doesn't looks a little

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
I guess now that where's the bark collar

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.350 
I guess now that where's the bark collar
so<00:06:13.530> this<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:13.979> him<00:06:14.510> he's<00:06:15.510> a<00:06:15.539> baby<00:06:17.030> so<00:06:18.030> I<00:06:18.300> just

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
so this is him he's a baby so I just

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.930 
so this is him he's a baby so I just
wanted<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.870> mention<00:06:19.320> that<00:06:21.139> but<00:06:22.139> like<00:06:22.789> if<00:06:23.789> you

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940

have<00:06:24.030> a<00:06:24.090> dog<00:06:24.300> smaller<00:06:24.780> than<00:06:24.990> that<00:06:25.110> and<00:06:25.320> the

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.990 
only reason I think he can even wear
this<00:06:27.419> is<00:06:27.599> because<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.380> his<00:06:28.650> fur<00:06:29.039> I<00:06:29.370> mean<00:06:29.820> if
