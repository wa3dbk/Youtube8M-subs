00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.330
 hello and in this video tutorial I tell you 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.900
 I will show you how to create such a tree and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.900
 beading 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.940
 what is required for our video tutorial 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 I have green beads so green 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:42.760
 color is big beads number six 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:50.030
 olga plaster wire thin sweat 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:53.329
 lacquer paint red do I mean 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.340
 mix color pasta with glue of choice with 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.590
 glue pva here I get this 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.230
 here is paint and alabaster 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.870
 Well, you show or until I will not 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.110
 because it is in my bag a and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.450
 here are the rods 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:16.729
 5 centimeters I have not cut 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:19.880
 already here and so let's start here at me 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.330
 wire and a half meters mean of 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.799
 this piece of wire will turn out 2 2 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.090
 twigs here 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.570
 we type a failure beads on a wire 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.770
 retreat from the beginning of 5 centimeters 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:41.590
 counting 5 beads and doing 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.590
 loop do twist 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 retreat half a centimeter and do more 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 once eyelet 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.290
 such loops chick need to do five 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.290
 stuff 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.310
 that's what I get and now all 5 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 eyelets need to be twisted together 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.760
 do about one centimeter here 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.700
 here 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.140
 what happened retreat somewhere 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.740
 centimeter and doing the same again 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.740
 flower 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.010
 if they come across you six there 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.990
 beads if you do not think yes 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:13.570
 there and do on the eye it's okay 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.570
 but they themselves already fall in hand 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.760
 it is advisable to secure stronger 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.760
 beads were not considered 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.900
 here and now we twist 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.450
 need to twist now wait here 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.650
 confused so need to twist before 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.650
 flower twist 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.950
 Of course you need to try so that they 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.850
 turned out on the same level here we fall back 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.390
 back a centimeter and doing it again 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.390
 flower 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.720
 we twist it now 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.610
 here and now here we twist 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:08.720
 down, too , somewhere around a centimeter here 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:11.480
 such a twig turns out cut off from me 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.740
 Here we take the river patch I have such 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.500
 wide adhesive plaster 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.130
 it is certainly not very convenient but what was 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:26.000
 I bought already what was the position means 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:36.100
 we take the print cut attacks 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:40.190
 in half here and take the rod take our 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.450
 our so well, don't know our points 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.450
 sprig twig data and so here 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.450
 we put on 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.190
 that's what we get these things 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.170
 I made 40 such branches 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.750
 can do less can do 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.690
 more it depends what tree you are 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.750
 want to create from rather big can 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.140
 make a small small amount 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.170
 if bigger you can do more 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.700
 that's all how to collect a tree I will show you 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.700
 in the next video tutorials
