00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
some ideas are so simple and in your

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.250 
some ideas are so simple and in your
face<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:12.219> they're<00:02:12.519> incredibly<00:02:13.299> smart<00:02:13.659> so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
face that they're incredibly smart so

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.110 
face that they're incredibly smart so
this<00:02:14.409> next<00:02:14.620> idea<00:02:15.099> when<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.370> hear<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.700> title

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
this next idea when you hear the title

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.849 
this next idea when you hear the title
the<00:02:16.329> world<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.109> go<00:02:17.200> ride<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:17.650> Jake

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
the world is going to go ride and Jake

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.589 
the world is going to go ride and Jake
think<00:02:18.129> of<00:02:18.219> that<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:19.060> first<00:02:19.269> album

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
think of that like the first album

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.020 
think of that like the first album
because<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.590> title<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.069> concept<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.909> just

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
because the title the concept of it just

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.240 
because the title the concept of it just
fits<00:02:22.359> him<00:02:22.510> perfectly<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:23.530> it's<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.890> simple

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
fits him perfectly and it's so simple

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.000 
fits him perfectly and it's so simple
but<00:02:24.879> yet<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.359> elegant<00:02:25.870> at<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:25.989> same<00:02:26.049> time<00:02:26.500> so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
but yet so elegant at the same time so

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.339 
but yet so elegant at the same time so
yeah<00:02:27.189> he<00:02:27.670> can't<00:02:27.939> stop<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.689> is<00:02:29.109> in<00:02:29.230> his

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
yeah he can't stop like this is in his

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.160 
yeah he can't stop like this is in his
blood<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.859> really<00:02:30.549> it's<00:02:30.639> just<00:02:30.819> James<00:02:31.540> Rubin

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
blood and really it's just James Rubin

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.520 
blood and really it's just James Rubin
and<00:02:32.349> she<00:02:32.439> would<00:02:32.590> be<00:02:32.709> 40<00:02:33.099> plus<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:34.359> hip<00:02:34.900> hop<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and she would be 40 plus in hip hop and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.550 
and she would be 40 plus in hip hop and
