she was in gone girl recently which I
actually<00:00:55.100> haven't<00:00:55.640> seen<00:00:56.110> um<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.170> do<00:00:57.350> really

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
actually haven't seen um I do really

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.950 
actually haven't seen um I do really
want<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.100> see<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.399> I<00:00:58.550> just<00:00:58.730> too<00:00:59.540> broke<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.810> go

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
want to see that I just too broke to go

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.440 
want to see that I just too broke to go
to<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.230> theater<00:01:00.470> she's<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.190> really<00:01:01.610> good<00:01:01.880> actress

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
to a theater she's a really good actress

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.730 
to a theater she's a really good actress
so<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.739> think<00:01:03.890> she'd<00:01:04.309> do<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.430> good<00:01:04.640> job<00:01:04.699> she<00:01:05.449> has

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
so I think she'd do a good job she has

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.440 
so I think she'd do a good job she has
at<00:01:06.740> least<00:01:06.920> as<00:01:07.130> far<00:01:07.250> as<00:01:07.399> I<00:01:07.460> can<00:01:07.520> tell<00:01:07.670> she<00:01:08.240> has

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
at least as far as I can tell she has

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.169 
at least as far as I can tell she has
had<00:01:08.840> no<00:01:09.020> experience<00:01:09.560> with<00:01:09.889> action<00:01:10.399> which<00:01:11.030> is

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
had no experience with action which is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.529 
had no experience with action which is
kind<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.539> a<00:01:11.749> negative<00:01:12.109> in<00:01:12.619> her<00:01:12.859> favor<00:01:13.539> but

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
kind of a negative in her favor but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.660 
kind of a negative in her favor but
she's<00:01:14.569> a<00:01:14.719> really<00:01:14.929> good<00:01:15.109> actress<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.920> they<00:01:16.609> do

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
she's a really good actress and they do

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.449 
she's a really good actress and they do
have<00:01:16.969> stone<00:01:17.240> equal<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:19.310> don't

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
have stone equal so you don't

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:20.889 
have stone equal so you don't
necessarily<00:01:19.579> have<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.999> be<00:01:20.090> familiar<00:01:20.450> faction

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
necessarily have to be familiar faction

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.319 
necessarily have to be familiar faction
plus<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:22.310> only<00:01:22.490> way<00:01:22.609> you<00:01:22.670> get<00:01:22.909> familiar<00:01:23.240> with

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
plus the only way you get familiar with

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.889 
plus the only way you get familiar with
action<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.959> do<00:01:24.170> an<00:01:24.259> action<00:01:24.649> movie<00:01:24.709> so<00:01:25.869> yeah<00:01:26.869> I

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
action is do an action movie so yeah I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.929 
action is do an action movie so yeah I
get<00:01:27.109> experience<00:01:27.560> somewhere<00:01:27.889> I<00:01:28.039> think<00:01:28.729> she'd

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
get experience somewhere I think she'd

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.969 
get experience somewhere I think she'd
probably<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.299> really<00:01:29.509> good<00:01:29.689> job<00:01:29.979> number

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
probably do a really good job number

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.840 
probably do a really good job number
four<00:01:31.340> charlize<00:01:32.090> theron<00:01:33.369> do<00:01:34.369> what<00:01:34.490> do<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.759> need

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
four charlize theron do what do I need

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.719

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.879 
to explain that she's a great actress
she<00:01:37.729> could<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:37.969> it<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:39.049> only<00:01:39.409> reason<00:01:39.590> why

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
she could do it the only reason why

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.919 
she could do it the only reason why
she's<00:01:40.189> at<00:01:40.340> number<00:01:40.609> four<00:01:40.880> not<00:01:41.149> number<00:01:41.450> one<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.869> I

she's at number four not number one is I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.599 
she's at number four not number one is I
think<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.039> did<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.369> math<00:01:43.689> um<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.779> think<00:01:44.959> she'd<00:01:45.439> be

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
think I did the math um I think she'd be

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.149 
think I did the math um I think she'd be
43<00:01:46.990> by<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.049> time<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.289> movie<00:01:48.499> came<00:01:48.770> out<00:01:48.920> I

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
43 by the time the movie came out I

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.399 
43 by the time the movie came out I
don't<00:01:49.670> think<00:01:49.849> that's<00:01:49.939> too<00:01:50.299> old<00:01:50.539> but<00:01:51.229> my

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
don't think that's too old but my

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.889 
don't think that's too old but my
opinion<00:01:51.709> doesn't<00:01:51.920> matter<00:01:52.539> what<00:01:53.539> matters<00:01:53.569> is

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
opinion doesn't matter what matters is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.599 
opinion doesn't matter what matters is
Marvel's<00:01:54.439> opinion<00:01:54.829> they<00:01:55.009> usually<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.429> to

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
Marvel's opinion they usually like to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.789 
Marvel's opinion they usually like to
cast<00:01:55.819> people<00:01:56.179> in<00:01:56.240> their<00:01:56.359> 30s<00:01:56.779> I<00:01:56.959> think<00:01:57.709> the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
cast people in their 30s I think the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.129 
cast people in their 30s I think the
oldest<00:01:58.219> person<00:01:58.249> they<00:01:58.700> cast<00:01:58.999> was<00:01:59.359> a<00:01:59.389> Don

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
oldest person they cast was a Don

I'm<00:05:33.120> on<00:05:33.360> this<00:05:33.540> list<00:05:33.870> but<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.320> know<00:05:34.440> what<00:05:34.710> well

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610

I'm on this list but you know what well
I<00:05:35.640> think<00:05:35.760> about<00:05:36.060> maybe<00:05:37.220> maybe<00:05:38.220> she<00:05:38.580> could<00:05:38.760> pull

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
this off and um well I think that I

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.950 
this off and um well I think that I
think<00:05:42.690> she<00:05:42.840> really<00:05:43.110> could<00:05:43.380> all<00:05:43.950> right<00:05:44.300> now<00:05:45.300> um

didn't work out well for Superman
although<00:06:10.230> i<00:06:10.500> think<00:06:10.530> that<00:06:10.920> was<00:06:11.010> mostly<00:06:11.280> the

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
although i think that was mostly the

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.580 
although i think that was mostly the
script<00:06:11.820> I<00:06:12.030> mean<00:06:12.540> he<00:06:12.780> was<00:06:12.900> a<00:06:12.930> blank<00:06:13.140> slate<00:06:13.410> in

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
script I mean he was a blank slate in

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.250 
script I mean he was a blank slate in
that<00:06:13.740> movie<00:06:14.150> he<00:06:15.150> didn't<00:06:15.420> add<00:06:15.570> anything<00:06:15.900> to<00:06:16.080> it

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
that movie he didn't add anything to it

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.570 
that movie he didn't add anything to it
but<00:06:16.560> I<00:06:16.590> don't<00:06:16.680> know<00:06:16.920> what<00:06:17.100> he<00:06:17.220> could<00:06:17.520> have

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
but I don't know what he could have

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.480 
but I don't know what he could have
added<00:06:17.820> to<00:06:18.120> it<00:06:18.770> but<00:06:19.770> of<00:06:19.860> course<00:06:19.920> we<00:06:20.190> also<00:06:20.340> have
