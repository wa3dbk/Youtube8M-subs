doesn't<00:01:08.490> change<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.939> strategy<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> how<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
doesn't change my strategy as to how a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
doesn't change my strategy as to how a
move<00:01:11.280> set<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> sink<00:01:12.090> should<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.360> created

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and I do have a couple of move sets in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.130 
and I do have a couple of move sets in
mind<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.880> mine<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> looks<00:01:18.869> like

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
set but it can also kind of act as a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
set but it can also kind of act as a
bulky<00:01:24.659> dragon<00:01:25.080> dance<00:01:25.259> set<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.549> keep

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
well you're gonna receive recoil I was

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.650 
well you're gonna receive recoil I was
thinking<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.759> raper<00:02:10.179> because<00:02:10.450> you're<00:02:10.569> gonna

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
thinking of raper because you're gonna

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.330 
thinking of raper because you're gonna
receive<00:02:11.170> pretty<00:02:11.560> much<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> same<00:02:11.950> amount<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
receive pretty much the same amount of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.680 
receive pretty much the same amount of
recoil<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.910> received<00:02:13.270> from<00:02:13.330> Freeport

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
recoil that you received from Freeport

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.690 
recoil that you received from Freeport
and<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.590> really<00:02:15.040> not<00:02:15.190> going<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.489> any

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and it's really not going to be any

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.490 
and it's really not going to be any
different<00:02:16.120> from<00:02:16.209> break<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.630> at<00:02:16.750> all<00:02:16.870> so

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
different from break right at all so

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.320 
different from break right at all so
it's<00:02:18.100> really<00:02:18.340> up<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.850> as<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:19.209> you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it's really up to you as to what you

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.600 
it's really up to you as to what you
could<00:02:19.510> want<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.989> run<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.830> could<00:02:21.040> also<00:02:21.220> run

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
could want to run you could also run

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.660 
could want to run you could also run
maybe<00:02:21.940> like<00:02:22.209> thrash<00:02:22.750> which<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.980> essentially

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
maybe like thrash which is essentially

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.350 
maybe like thrash which is essentially
like<00:02:24.880> outrage<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.530> get<00:02:26.770> it's<00:02:27.370> fine<00:02:28.000> type

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
like outrage but you get it's fine type

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.809 
like outrage but you get it's fine type
now<00:02:28.569> because<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.380> aerial<00:02:29.739> ace<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.610> I

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
now because you have aerial ace but I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.699 
now because you have aerial ace but I
wouldn't<00:02:31.120> necessarily<00:02:31.239> do<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:32.319> you're

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
wouldn't necessarily do that if you're

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.170 
wouldn't necessarily do that if you're
also<00:02:32.890> running<00:02:33.160> out<00:02:33.430> rage<00:02:33.670> because<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.060> just

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
want to have like one stab that's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.430 
want to have like one stab that's
guaranteed<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.390> know<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.720> work<00:02:37.989> for<00:02:38.260> one

guaranteed to you know like work for one

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
guaranteed to you know like work for one
turn<00:02:38.739> if<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.040> need<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.180> honestly<00:02:40.780> I

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
would just do like outrage and then have

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.170 
would just do like outrage and then have
double<00:02:43.690> edge<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.350> go<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.250> know<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.670> in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
double edge just to go you know if in

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
double edge just to go you know if in
case<00:02:46.209> anything<00:02:46.630> happens<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:48.130> would<00:02:48.760> also

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
case anything happens so I would also

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.140 
case anything happens so I would also
like<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.540> said<00:02:49.569> 250<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> speed<00:02:50.709> 250<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.489> attack

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
like I said 250 to speed 250 to attack

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.110 
like I said 250 to speed 250 to attack
keep<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.750> simple<00:02:52.959> go<00:02:53.530> Jolly<00:02:53.980> or<00:02:54.370> adamant<00:02:55.030> and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
keep it simple go Jolly or adamant and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.729 
keep it simple go Jolly or adamant and
really<00:02:55.300> depends<00:02:55.630> on<00:02:55.690> how<00:02:55.840> fast<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.350> thing<00:02:56.590> is

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
really depends on how fast this thing is

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.300 
really depends on how fast this thing is
probably<00:02:57.010> Jolly<00:02:57.459> though<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:59.830> yeah<00:03:00.130> this

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
probably Jolly though but yeah this

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.190 
probably Jolly though but yeah this
thing<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.610> looking<00:03:00.730> incredibly<00:03:01.720> powerful

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
thing is looking incredibly powerful

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.259 
thing is looking incredibly powerful
right<00:03:02.350> now<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.739> expect<00:03:03.400> mega<00:03:03.610> salamence<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.150> get

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
right now I expect mega salamence to get

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.340 
right now I expect mega salamence to get
banned<00:03:04.450> into<00:03:04.660> Hooper's<00:03:04.959> I<00:03:05.080> don't<00:03:05.230> think

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
banned into Hooper's I don't think

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.990 
banned into Hooper's I don't think
that's<00:03:05.500> gonna<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.860> doubt<00:03:06.100> at<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.580> don't

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that's gonna be a doubt at all I don't

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.220 
that's gonna be a doubt at all I don't
think<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.209> thing<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.510> kind<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.720> last<00:03:07.930> like

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
and that's gonna be a huge killer there

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.180 
and that's gonna be a huge killer there
because<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.959> stuff<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.350> double<00:03:17.799> edged<00:03:17.950> and
