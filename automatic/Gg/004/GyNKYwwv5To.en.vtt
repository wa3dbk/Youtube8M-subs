00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.390
 i play the jesus 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.780
 When you this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.770
 i see jesus as a man 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.150
 So that's always in the piece 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.870
 said this topic he is a man of 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:02.860
 must go through the unthinkable 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:05.630
 and how do you handle it somewhere in the world? 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.650
 run of his career to hear oh 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.550
 By the way, the next step will be 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.740
 be pretty heavy 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.890
 you will suffer you will die and you will 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.479
 have to come to terms with that and that is 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.000
 incredibly playable 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.940
 because everyone understands that 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.690
 Can this be how far I am ready to go 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.020
 are going to do what is done 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.020
 got to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.989
 Above all, I think this role must 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.379
 every time be rethought and the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:19.340
 challenge is always that easy 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:23.470
 as possible to act and react 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.880
 how a person acts and reacts 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.160
 I also played judas very often 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.440
 and I think that helps too 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.239
 reasonably if you go the other side 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.239
 then knows the coin 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.210
 because Jesus was not a nice brava human 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.380
 you really crucified because you are nice 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:36.800
 but because you are some people 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:46.940
 then it bothered me and I always go 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:50.210
 back to the text the pilate says this 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.730
 that was no one can normally relaxed 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.310
 human and that is always 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.910
 interesting him almost as wild 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.300
 animal as an activist as a politician 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.300
 to see 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.989
 he will become that piece of superstar 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.100
 but a bit more detailed than 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.570
 usually are 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.600
 The case is like that now 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.230
 maybe from any 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 He already knows hollywood movies 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.380
 is already becoming a stronger character 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.390
 So also take up very clear 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.550
 game of history and it will be 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.100
 So clearly emerged the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.040
 betrayal is just as important in the end 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.790
 for the message of jesus and for his 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.760
 So we Jesus the Cross dies 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.260
 that this dispute whether that 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.740
 not exactly as a sacrifice is and 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.740
 not only betrays 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.389
 I think the two have that time 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.780
 that was really that was in principle 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.120
 they believe that the second piece and that 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.669
 first large or full-length piece 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.960
 at all 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.930
 they just have it with me 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.850
 great passion we made the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.740
 the music is relatively relatively timeless 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.560
 So you can get rid of them at least for a while 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.630
 sing and play but mount now 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.950
 it is simple, it is simple too 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.230
 honest and authentic 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:42.770
 the lyrics are very good and that is why 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.770
 us up to date
