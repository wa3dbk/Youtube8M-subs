00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
have to make an adjustment there what we

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
have to make an adjustment there what we
did<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.150> came<00:02:51.450> up<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:51.780> three<00:02:51.990> flows<00:02:52.260> we've

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
did is we came up with three flows we've

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.160 
did is we came up with three flows we've
got<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> three-quarter<00:02:53.130> 7<00:02:54.000> 8<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.570> 1<00:02:54.750> inch<00:02:54.930> which

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
got a three-quarter 7 8 and 1 inch which

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.480 
got a three-quarter 7 8 and 1 inch which
flows<00:02:55.410> give<00:02:55.770> or<00:02:55.920> take<00:02:56.070> 120<00:02:56.790> 160<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.959> 210<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.400> we

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
flows give or take 120 160 and 210 so we

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.550 
flows give or take 120 160 and 210 so we
took<00:02:59.670> three<00:02:59.970> popular<00:03:00.480> flows<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.110> least<00:03:01.320> of

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
took three popular flows the least of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.110 
took three popular flows the least of
which<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.770> still<00:03:02.160> enough<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> engage<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.940> fire

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120

no ball shut off it's got what we call a
hydrofoil<00:04:23.740> on<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.130> inside<00:04:24.490> now<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.360> actually

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
hydrofoil on the inside now I actually

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.270 
hydrofoil on the inside now I actually
hear<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.140> and<00:04:26.290> see<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.500> floating<00:04:26.830> here

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280

everybody out there Jerry let's be
honest<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.350> used<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> ball<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.340> mean<00:04:30.490> L<00:04:30.700> it

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
honest is used to a ball I mean L it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.000 
honest is used to a ball I mean L it
does<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.870> circular<00:04:32.230> with<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> hole<00:04:32.770> in<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
does is it's circular with a hole in the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.250 
does is it's circular with a hole in the
center<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.370> twist<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.940> closes<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.750> hole<00:04:35.020> up

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
center you twist it closes that hole up

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.960 
center you twist it closes that hole up
I<00:04:35.410> mean<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.770> self-contained<00:04:36.070> little<00:04:36.670> unit

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
I mean it's a self-contained little unit

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.790 
I mean it's a self-contained little unit
how<00:04:37.090> did<00:04:37.210> we<00:04:37.300> change<00:04:37.480> this<00:04:37.780> well<00:04:38.290> what<00:04:38.470> we<00:04:38.590> did

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
how did we change this well what we did

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.950 
how did we change this well what we did
is<00:04:39.010> it's<00:04:39.460> not<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.910> ball<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.540> fallible

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
is it's not that the ball is a fallible

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.260 
is it's not that the ball is a fallible
product<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:41.590> great<00:04:41.860> but<00:04:42.400> by<00:04:42.550> design<00:04:42.970> when<00:04:43.210> we

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
product it's great but by design when we

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.090 
product it's great but by design when we
were<00:04:43.390> looking<00:04:43.750> at<00:04:43.840> getting<00:04:44.080> three<00:04:44.500> flows<00:04:44.830> in

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
were looking at getting three flows in

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620 
were looking at getting three flows in
we<00:04:45.250> needed<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.580> come<00:04:45.640> up<00:04:45.760> with<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:46.060> way<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.540> we

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
we needed to come up with a way that we

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.930 
we needed to come up with a way that we
could<00:04:46.780> actually<00:04:46.860> create<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:48.040> tight<00:04:48.370> stream<00:04:48.760> at

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
could actually create a tight stream at

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.300 
could actually create a tight stream at
all<00:04:49.060> three<00:04:49.360> flows<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.380> hydrofoil<00:04:50.950> does

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
all three flows and this hydrofoil does

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.640 
all three flows and this hydrofoil does
it<00:04:51.490> it's<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:52.000> bulb<00:04:52.300> shaped<00:04:52.750> apparatus<00:04:53.500> the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
it it's a bulb shaped apparatus the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.830 
it it's a bulb shaped apparatus the
water<00:04:53.890> actually<00:04:54.100> wraps<00:04:54.670> around<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.270> bulb<00:04:55.600> as

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
water actually wraps around the bulb as

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.870 
water actually wraps around the bulb as
it's<00:04:56.020> coming<00:04:56.230> out<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:57.160> screen<00:04:57.460> comes<00:04:57.700> out

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
it's coming out and the screen comes out

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.000 
it's coming out and the screen comes out
so<00:04:58.210> tight<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.960> can<00:04:59.080> virtually<00:04:59.560> see<00:04:59.740> through

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
so tight you can virtually see through

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.860 
so tight you can virtually see through
it<00:05:00.040> but<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.670> stream<00:05:00.910> doesn't<00:05:01.300> even<00:05:01.390> touch<00:05:01.630> the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
it but the stream doesn't even touch the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.930 
it but the stream doesn't even touch the
inside<00:05:01.900> diameter<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:02.980> bore<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:03.520> based<00:05:03.760> on

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
inside diameter of this bore so based on

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.520 
inside diameter of this bore so based on
that<00:05:04.000> hydrofoil<00:05:04.600> on<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.930> inside<00:05:05.200> what<00:05:05.410> you're

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
that hydrofoil on the inside what you're

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.620 
that hydrofoil on the inside what you're
saying<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:06.040> it's<00:05:06.340> turning<00:05:06.790> that<00:05:06.910> stream<00:05:07.270> into

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
saying is it's turning that stream into

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.840 
saying is it's turning that stream into
a<00:05:07.660> waterway<00:05:08.230> of<00:05:08.380> its<00:05:08.530> own<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:09.310> not<00:05:09.550> being

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
a waterway of its own it's not being

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.550 
a waterway of its own it's not being
directed<00:05:10.330> by<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.540> outside<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.200> this<00:05:11.320> nozzle

wrecked<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.580> can<00:05:12.760> see<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.210> space<00:05:13.420> in

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
wrecked and you can see the space in

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.690 
wrecked and you can see the space in
between<00:05:13.660> yes<00:05:14.410> all<00:05:14.680> right<00:05:14.800> now<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.310> know<00:05:15.550> I'm

between yes all right now I know I'm
playing<00:05:16.120> as<00:05:16.330> if<00:05:16.540> I'm<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.750> little<00:05:16.780> bit<00:05:17.050> dumb<00:05:17.200> on

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
playing as if I'm a little bit dumb on

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.690 
playing as if I'm a little bit dumb on
this<00:05:17.470> one<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.650> haven't<00:05:18.040> seen<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.280> I've<00:05:18.400> played

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
this one I haven't seen it I've played

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.090 
this one I haven't seen it I've played
with<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.030> nozzle<00:05:19.240> I've<00:05:19.780> flowed<00:05:20.230> the<00:05:20.740> 50

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
with this nozzle I've flowed the 50

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.560 
with this nozzle I've flowed the 50
pounds<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.640> tip<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:21.940> amazing<00:05:22.450> because

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
pounds that the tip is amazing because

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.540 
pounds that the tip is amazing because
it's<00:05:22.870> workable<00:05:23.230> but<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.830> best<00:05:23.980> feature<00:05:24.250> about

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
it's workable but the best feature about

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.520 
it's workable but the best feature about
it<00:05:24.820> literally<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.570> can<00:05:25.720> take<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.900> hairpin<00:05:26.320> go

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
it literally you can take a hairpin go

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
it literally you can take a hairpin go
in<00:05:26.650> there<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:26.860> slide<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.070> around<00:05:27.280> on<00:05:27.460> the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
in there and slide it around on the

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.760 
in there and slide it around on the
outside<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:28.270> wouldn't<00:05:28.540> even<00:05:28.570> get<00:05:28.840> way<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:29.500> it's

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
outside it wouldn't even get way so it's

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.860 
outside it wouldn't even get way so it's
wrapping<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.460> hydrofoil<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.390> Jerry<00:05:31.570> what's

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
wrapping that hydrofoil and Jerry what's

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.480 
wrapping that hydrofoil and Jerry what's
that<00:05:32.050> going<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.260> do<00:05:32.380> for<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.650> water<00:05:32.890> when<00:05:33.340> it's

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
that going to do for the water when it's
