00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.660
 the eating tent four 85 millimeter pests of carl zeiss is in the very light 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.149
 sensitivities classic portrait lens 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.639
 it is a solidly built forward also a positive one 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 a bit heavy but yes with an opening of a point 4 there you still have something 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.009
 glass needed 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.009
 also past the camera 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.349
 anyway be careful that these people is that the course starts but especially too 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.980
 focus on my new focus 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.250
 must be arranged on the plates and that is in the top 10 I am running giessendam 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.600
 hand to say you 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 lawyer either 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.980
 the first thing that is noticeable when the cup of tea follows the Portuguese 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.470
 from 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.700
 and when shooting it is the scraping sound of the auto focus 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.190
 this sounds really cheap 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 so driving is not possible for such a house 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.140
 that sets noise is because the auto focus is controlled with gears and 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.730
 axes and I am a floating motorbike know if no can have that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.910
 but it is that did not yield that 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.840
 This is typical for people who already have portrait photography 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 gaga is a bag but these people are also very up to date 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.549
 ship with his guests opening a point 4 static and fat cells we can 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.549
 they can stay behind 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.270
 and I think he was touched 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.450
 the grand opening of a new celebration 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.090
 I will be very useful and deliver very special portraits on a very 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.480
 selective sharpness 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.600
 of course you have to focus very well because before you know it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260
 is subject 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.100
 that reasoning slightly further after two points 8 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.250
 then you still have a very nice selective concert but contrast and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.320
 sharpness only increases 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 is left behind scattered 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.030
 grabbing as he is of course known for is the beautiful bet 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.920
 it may sound a bit strange that photography always wants a sharp photo 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.179
 but especially that a thorough blur is beautiful 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:15.209
 the 9 rounded slats 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.699
 take care of that too 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:18.879
 beautiful images 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.709
 a photographer for the summer 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.939
 who make many portraits are an absolute must 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.059
 for more than a thousand euros you have beautiful portraits us 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.139
 almere 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.459
 cheaper today scraping too late at the focus
