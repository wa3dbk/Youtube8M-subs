00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
have the spy plane the Blackbird and the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.090 
have the spy plane the Blackbird and the
dogs<00:00:15.690> some<00:00:16.170> kind<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.410> mixing<00:00:16.680> things<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
dogs some kind of mixing things up a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.980 
dogs some kind of mixing things up a
little<00:00:17.220> bit<00:00:17.400> there<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.699> i<00:00:17.789> typically<00:00:18.150> go<00:00:18.420> with

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
little bit there as i typically go with

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
little bit there as i typically go with
the<00:00:19.109> chopper<00:00:19.410> gunner<00:00:19.619> instead<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.369> spy

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the chopper gunner instead of that spy

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.929 
the chopper gunner instead of that spy
plane<00:00:21.029> down<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.900> low<00:00:22.140> end<00:00:22.820> although<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
plane down on the low end although the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.189 
plane down on the low end although the
chopper<00:00:24.180> gunner<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> nun<00:00:24.660> low<00:00:24.840> end<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.109> all

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
chopper gunner is a nun low end at all

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.920 
chopper gunner is a nun low end at all
but<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.580> reason<00:00:26.730> i<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.300> spy<00:00:27.480> plane<00:00:27.720> in

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
but the reason i go for spy plane in

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.290 
but the reason i go for spy plane in
free-for-all<00:00:28.560> particularly<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.090> you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
free-for-all particularly is that in you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700 
free-for-all particularly is that in you
know<00:00:30.420> team<00:00:30.660> games<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.080> kind<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.470> your

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
know team games you kind of have your

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
know team games you kind of have your
side<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> map<00:00:32.340> their<00:00:32.850> side<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> map<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
side of the map their side of the map so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
side of the map their side of the map so
you<00:00:33.570> typically<00:00:33.899> don't<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.260> flanked<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.770> often

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you typically don't get flanked as often

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.500 
you typically don't get flanked as often
and<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> look<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.390> your

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and you can kind of look at your

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.729 
and you can kind of look at your
teammates<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> flanks<00:00:37.620> are

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
teammates to see where the flanks are

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
teammates to see where the flanks are
and<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> opposing<00:00:38.640> team<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> there

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and where the opposing team is is there

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
and where the opposing team is is there
going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.510> chunk<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> bunch<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> metal<00:00:40.800> at

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
going to be chunk in a bunch of metal at

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
going to be chunk in a bunch of metal at
them<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.030> you'll<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> pretty

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
them and so you'll kind of have a pretty

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
them and so you'll kind of have a pretty
good<00:00:43.110> idea<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> shoot<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.610> how

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
good idea of where to shoot at and how

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
good idea of where to shoot at and how
to<00:00:44.820> move<00:00:45.090> around<00:00:45.210> without<00:00:45.539> getting<00:00:45.960> shot<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to move around without getting shot in

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
to move around without getting shot in
the<00:00:46.890> background<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> sides<00:00:47.550> whereas<00:00:47.910> on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the background the sides whereas on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.279 
the background the sides whereas on
free-for-all<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.780> kinds<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> crazy

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289

the pain that is getting shot in the
back<00:00:57.180> especially<00:00:57.660> when<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.899> spawn<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.469> hey

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
back especially when you spawn like hey

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
back especially when you spawn like hey
I'm<00:00:58.710> alive<00:00:58.949> run<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.280> shot<00:00:59.910> in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.000> back<00:01:00.180> dang

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
I'm alive run out shot in the back dang

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.009 
I'm alive run out shot in the back dang
it<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.789> why<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.510> five

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it but that is why I use these five

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
it but that is why I use these five
point<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.379> keep<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> say<00:01:04.920> UAV<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
point I keep one to say UAV but that is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.850 
point I keep one to say UAV but that is
not<00:01:06.060> right<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.570> must<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.760> UAV<00:01:09.360> now

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
not right I must know that's not UAV now

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.679 
not right I must know that's not UAV now
so<00:01:10.860> yeah<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.220> why<00:01:11.310> i<00:01:11.369> use<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.150> spy<00:01:12.390> plane

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
so yeah that is why i use the spy plane

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.109 
so yeah that is why i use the spy plane
if<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.010> wondering<00:01:14.310> i<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.909> i

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
if you are all wondering i think it's i

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.520 
if you are all wondering i think it's i
think<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.869> better<00:01:16.049> than<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
think it's a little bit better than the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
think it's a little bit better than the
chopper<00:01:16.860> gunner<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.790> situation<00:01:18.090> because

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
chopper gunner in this situation because

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.820 
chopper gunner in this situation because
it<00:01:18.600> helps<00:01:18.750> me<00:01:18.810> build<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> kill<00:01:19.500> streak<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it helps me build up that kill streak to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
it helps me build up that kill streak to
the<00:01:19.950> dogs<00:01:20.159> faster<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:20.970> dogs<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.509> free

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the dogs faster and the dogs on free

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.840 
the dogs faster and the dogs on free
