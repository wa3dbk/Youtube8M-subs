can't<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> camera<00:01:51.860> down<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:52.920> but

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
can't just get the camera down there but

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.289 
can't just get the camera down there but
this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.350> timing<00:01:56.130> belt<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.549> perfect

looks<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:59.630> yeah<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.960> thought<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> would<00:02:01.649> need

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
looks like yeah I thought I would need

looks like yeah I thought I would need
to<00:02:01.920> change<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.420> became<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:04.799> timing

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to change it but it just became a timing

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
belt inspection so I just put it back

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.639 
belt inspection so I just put it back
together<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.629> jolly<00:02:10.050> good<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.410> another

numbers and around here it looks like
2009<00:02:34.440> May<00:02:35.130> 18<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.350> timing<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:38.130> in

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
2009 May 18 so the timing that is in
