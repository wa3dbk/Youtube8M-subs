00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello people a very short video and 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.580
 Although how to be his father calf 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 his tents together put the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.509
 Antonio Knicks got me yesterday 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.670
 posted on youtube and he says 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.929
 He is packing his backpack and me 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.760
 should show again how to do this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 water collapses because it is not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.769
 so light is the technique of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
 living together is easy but yes 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.130
 it is already a polio of this water 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 It is difficult to put together because 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 by the silicone stories and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.470
 the smooth surface i can do that 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.390
 the prohibition always lays down together 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.040
 again and I want to show you now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.210
 yes, how easy it is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 can merge 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.710
 Let's go this water this outside 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.230
 So a silicone seam now I put that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.739
 once together there was once together 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 silicone must then trigger up here 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 is this wicona outside are the bad guys 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.049
 i grab the outside of the corner 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.119
 and put an opposite side 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.119
 the corner lies together 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:22.470
 it has a smaller one here 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:23.810
 size the whole way it looks like now 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 out 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.630
 yes, then I do nothing more than that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.630
 whole halved again 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.039
 and then again the camera has to 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.280
 get a little closer 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.009
 what I am doing now is following and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.259
 just before said this merge 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.539
 Technology also applies to all jobs 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.770
 tent canvas harsh off you can use it 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.619
 put everything together 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.229
 so i have that little area of 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.880
 then create a size of a pillow 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.520
 I grab this outer now 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.009
 page at 7 o'clock to the middle as you like 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.530
 there is a lot to see here 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.500
 I'll say the whole bender and it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.390
 I just think inside to the half 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.090
 grab the opposite side 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 and beat it up to the half 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.610
 so difficult now the whole 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.930
 again, the page would be over here and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.110
 As you can see now I have here 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.410
 such a really accurate hose of the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.420
 yes the pages are well completed 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.019
 right here now, too, I have the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 possibility either I hold the whole 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.660
 So what I do then I do so 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 small package that means I take me 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.519
 the end and the end of this page 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.319
 here 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.019
 important is that here in the middle one 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.109
 gap is because now I can do it 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.910
 all together 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.870
 then I usually take my parag 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.510
 Place it like that and then I'm like this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.750
 real package here just like that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:09.959
 small package so all talking around here 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.430
 also again the driver can already 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.870
 the length I need later 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.190
 for the construction of my stars I have 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.440
 already two fly with one stone 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.859
 beaten so i find this here 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.859
 together make a loop purely 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.570
 Reason is finished my water package my 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.490
 friend also packages I can such a 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.590
 stow backpack without problems it is 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.050
 compact does not work anymore 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.360
 yes, and so I have my problem 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.020
 solved and can my backpack now good 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.209
 pack 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.070
 yes I hope I could with this 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.900
 small tip to help and you have 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.500
 it will be easier with a backpack in the future 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.870
 pack 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.459
 I'll get a video right now 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.340
 Turn connection and there I will you 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.990
 Show your rug like that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.530
 Together she wanted that one here 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.620
 nice roll you have on the outside of the backpack 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.330
 so people can fix me yes 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.100
 wish you much pleasure as always 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.420
 everything she makes a lot of fun in 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.690
 the nature and see you in the next 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.170
 So you have to video again by then 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.150
 have this rug freed her 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.090
 and then you hit her once in the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.100
 middle together 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.390
 who the long side is halved so 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.390
 once the long side
