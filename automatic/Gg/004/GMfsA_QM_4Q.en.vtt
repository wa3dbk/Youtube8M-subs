00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
base of the rocket launcher along with a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.060 
base of the rocket launcher along with a
smaller<00:03:12.450> piece<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> rocket<00:03:13.739> pods<00:03:13.920> to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
smaller piece for the rocket pods to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.599 
smaller piece for the rocket pods to
fasten<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:15.590> next<00:03:16.590> after<00:03:17.220> painting<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
fasten on to next after painting the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.240 
fasten on to next after painting the
party<00:03:17.910> hats<00:03:18.120> red<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.660> cut<00:03:19.230> them<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.500> size<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.980> fit

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
party hats red I cut them to size to fit

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.560 
party hats red I cut them to size to fit
inside<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:21.000> pods

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
inside the pods

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.770 
inside the pods
these<00:03:22.350> are<00:03:22.650> rockets

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
these are rockets

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.990 
these are rockets
don't<00:03:24.290> worry<00:03:24.440> about<00:03:24.560> their<00:03:24.830> size<00:03:25.069> they're

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
don't worry about their size they're

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.610 
don't worry about their size they're
meant<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.209> be<00:03:26.270> filmed<00:03:26.660> at<00:03:26.750> an<00:03:26.840> angle<00:03:27.230> or<00:03:27.590> you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
meant to be filmed at an angle or you

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.370 
meant to be filmed at an angle or you
won't<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.069> able<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.250> see<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.610> entire<00:03:28.700> rocket

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
won't be able to see the entire rocket

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.140 
won't be able to see the entire rocket
after<00:03:30.380> blowing<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.830> pods<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.610> base<00:03:31.790> strip

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
after blowing the pods to the base strip

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.199 
after blowing the pods to the base strip
I<00:03:32.390> glued<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.410> rocket<00:03:33.770> ends<00:03:34.040> into<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.370> pots<00:03:34.670> as

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
I glued the rocket ends into the pots as

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.290 
I glued the rocket ends into the pots as
you<00:03:36.200> can<00:03:36.350> see<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.980> face<00:03:37.220> piece<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.790> folded<00:03:38.180> up

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
you can see the face piece is folded up

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.690 
you can see the face piece is folded up
so<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.990> Rockets<00:03:39.350> themselves<00:03:39.500> fall<00:03:40.100> down<00:03:40.370> with

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
so the Rockets themselves fall down with

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.330 
so the Rockets themselves fall down with
the<00:03:40.790> help<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.060> gravity<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:42.739> helps<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:43.190> add<00:03:43.310> a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
the help of gravity it helps to add a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.340 
the help of gravity it helps to add a
couple<00:03:43.850> of<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> magnets<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.930> bottom<00:03:45.260> of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
couple of the magnets to the bottom of

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.530 
couple of the magnets to the bottom of
the<00:03:45.410> pods<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.310> not<00:03:46.489> only<00:03:46.760> do<00:03:47.030> they<00:03:47.090> fall<00:03:47.390> down

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
the pods so not only do they fall down

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.990 
the pods so not only do they fall down
faster<00:03:48.110> from<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.319> weight<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.580> magnets

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
faster from the weight but the magnets

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.130 
faster from the weight but the magnets
will<00:03:50.180> stick<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.540> your<00:03:50.690> car

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
will stick to your car

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.170 
will stick to your car
the<00:03:51.440> final<00:03:51.860> step<00:03:52.069> is<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> fasten<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> base

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
the final step is to fasten the base

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.870 
the final step is to fasten the base
piece<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.140> painters<00:03:54.500> tray<00:03:54.770> and<00:03:55.069> add<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
piece to the painters tray and add the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.880 
piece to the painters tray and add the
rest<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.209> magnets<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.989> base<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
rest of the magnets to the base so it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.360 
rest of the magnets to the base so it
all<00:03:58.010> sticks<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.550> your<00:03:58.730> car<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.769> best<00:04:00.769> way<00:04:00.980> to

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
all sticks to your car the best way to

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.610 
all sticks to your car the best way to
actually<00:04:01.550> use<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.150> prop<00:04:02.420> just<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.200> fishing

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
actually use this prop just a fishing

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.699 
actually use this prop just a fishing
line<00:04:03.830> or<00:04:04.430> floss<00:04:05.120> tied<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.230> top<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.590> box

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
line or floss tied to the top of the box

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.500 
line or floss tied to the top of the box
itself<00:04:07.070> then<00:04:07.820> run<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.209> line

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
itself then run the line

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.660 
itself then run the line
really<00:04:08.750> far<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.620> back<00:04:09.769> of<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:09.980> car<00:04:10.160> then

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
really far to the back of the car then

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.610 
really far to the back of the car then
when<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:10.970> get<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> nice<00:04:11.269> wide<00:04:11.540> shot<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.500> have

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
when you get a nice wide shot you have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.070 
when you get a nice wide shot you have
someone<00:04:12.980> pull<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.730> it<00:04:13.850> slowly<00:04:14.180> opens<00:04:14.690> now

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
someone pull it so it slowly opens now

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.840 
someone pull it so it slowly opens now
although<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.800> made<00:04:15.950> for<00:04:16.220> your<00:04:16.340> car<00:04:16.579> and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
although this is made for your car and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.219 
although this is made for your car and
it's<00:04:17.120> supposed<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.390> look<00:04:17.540> really<00:04:17.750> cool<00:04:17.930> and

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
it's supposed to look really cool and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.330 
it's supposed to look really cool and
you're<00:04:18.320> driving<00:04:18.470> around<00:04:18.709> doing<00:04:19.130> all<00:04:19.220> your

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
you're driving around doing all your

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.030 
you're driving around doing all your
action<00:04:19.700> stuff<00:04:20.109> be<00:04:21.109> really<00:04:21.380> careful<00:04:21.739> with<00:04:21.829> it

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
action stuff be really careful with it

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.350 
action stuff be really careful with it
because<00:04:22.220> this<00:04:22.639> is<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.790> great<00:04:23.030> way<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.180> become

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
because this is a great way to become

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.600 
because this is a great way to become
popular<00:04:23.900> with<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:25.190> law<00:04:25.310> enforcement
