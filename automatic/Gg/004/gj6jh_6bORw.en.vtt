00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 look at the first question how come 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.970
 unfold this early recovery rather 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 well it's rather difficult would say we have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.509
 attacked Sunday with a little football but 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.790
 but already on Monday we went back to 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.130
 lively subject anouk not much 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.739
 accessories but but this is really 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.640
 hard and exercise that are very varied one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.370
 does not usually work like 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 that we have big day I think I 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 think we left to make a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 good prep he had given instructions 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 during the holidays is what you have 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 do your homework just yeah that's 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.640
 true before before the truce we have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.079
 told us to talk about 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.989
 run and a minimum because otherwise 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.519
 according to his words we do not survive so we have 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.350
 all these young people a little scared and I think 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.839
 that everyone has made necessary to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 arrive at minimal on loan and for 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.499
 enjoy the preparation we have 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 physically how do you feel but me 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.769
 I'm ok I got really good 13th 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.360
 was a long time since I had not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.159
 I had not had so many vacations so 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.520
 I took the opportunity to recharge 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.870
 battery 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.730
 the season was long so I 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.290
 really benefited and I arrive with 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.000
 the envied on the prepa so that's 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.930
 really important and I really 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340
 want to work that's good 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.230
 short selling a new job 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.550
 since in the absence of coach 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.710
 assistant or translator is you 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.350
 who are you kidding how is it going with 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 with our notebooks it is played ben for 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.810
 the moment it's going pretty well 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.610
 true it's a bit peculiar 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 since so do not speak yet 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 still french so I have a little 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860
 a little bit the intermediary puts to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.780
 provide for everyone and everyone 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 put his own and so things 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 are moving forward and going well and there is no 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 worry about it if it helps 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.430
 the team I do it with pleasure and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 no worry then leaving a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.080
 week in slovenia it goes necessarily 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 strengthen group cohesion 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.180
 the new ones with the old ones is 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.040
 of course it's true that internships 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.810
 like that it's important for a team 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.890
 and cohesion like you said was 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.330
 one to three new players this year 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.190
 that certain not speak the language 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.050
 so we will do everything for the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.970
 integrate I think they have they have 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.399
 Finally, what I have seen is 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.899
 really good guys who have a great 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.340
 temperament and I think they're going 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.140
 integrate quickly enough and we go everything 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.970
 do it for that and then we go on 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.470
 slovenia week is going to be far away from 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.000
 with us it will be very difficult so 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.310
 I think that's okay we'll weld 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.330
 I hope it will be beneficial for the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.770
 rest of the season 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.820
 you are in delacourt in slovenia he 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.709
 seems that there will be three workouts 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.770
 per day is what you were able to discuss 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.080
 already with nico 1 who we know is a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.320
 already worked under the orders of nokia 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.090
 that nico played four years with our cases 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.040
 so that's 4 prep and what I 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.810
 had heard it was pretty hard there was 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.290
 all in one stage in quotation marks 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.760
 commando I think in the morning we run 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.650
 even before brekky distances 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.810
 long enough to me I prepared myself 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.680
 a little mentally to that I know that 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.209
 is going to be very hard 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.690
 then get up very early I do not like 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.070
 too small so we have a concept 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.320
 years expecting something hard but 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.910
 but in my opinion we do not realize 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.530
 what it's going to be and I hope everything 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 the world will come alive this week 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.170
 the fact that our cases 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.640
 we will say start a season with you 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.960
 remember that happened in the month of 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.100
 last February the fact that it starts 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.830
 a season and you is it changing 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.610
 something especially in schemas 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.340
 tactics etc 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.330
 what does it change we can not 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.680
 still too serene happy because 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.050
 it's early May but clearly I 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.940
 think it will make a big difference 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.350
 because take the team have a month 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.960
 and a half before before the start of a 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.640
 season to be able to work all the 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.660
 play all the interlocking it's not 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.870
 important and I think the anuga 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.570
 can really enjoy it we have 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.270
 a complete team to find 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 find lesions between us 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.030
 all work all areas of play 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.410
 I really think it's going to be good 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.110
 we also have a lot of friendlies 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.120
 we're going to really be able to run is 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.770
 found full of settings so it's I 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.700
 think it's super important and that's 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.080
 true it's up to us too to do 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.520
 so that it is not really beneficial 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.239
 what will your personal goals be 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.440
 this season 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.850
 well I hope will continue in the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.520
 lineage from the previous season where 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.950
 where we did in the end of a good season 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.000
 where the club continues to ride me 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.340
 I have my fingers of I am in a 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.790
 upward slope continues to progress 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.590
 a maximum enjoy it here is to do 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.120
 a month and a half in preparation with our 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.850
 cages for that can really good too 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.630
 then after trying to keep my place 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.700
 in France team 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.520
 continued to impose myself too and why 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.440
 not have other medals done this 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.880
 would be really great but for 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.410
 the moment I really think with this in 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.420
 provence to do independently beginning of 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.280
 season we have as I said we had 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.670
 good reinforcements if the mayonnaise takes 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.140
 well we can really think I think 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.120
 make good matches is very hung 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.710
 a nice victory after we will not get 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.660
 lie the first goal will always be 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.370
 maintaining but but it 's having the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.670
 as soon as possible and to make a beautiful 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.080
 season 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.360
 how exactly do you imagine this 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.490
 new season how do you think 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.800
 located is going to be excess versus is 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.700
 well for platoon risks as I 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.840
 said 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.600
 what is important for the club is 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.240
 to stay in the same dynamic so 9th 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.680
 place 8th place why not finally that I 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.729
 think we're in this area 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.960
 there after, as we saw 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.669
 the competitors have strengthened well 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.620
 also when we see something other than 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.969
 secreted for example who is riding it's 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.620
 a very good right now so that's going to be 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.949
 still difficult all year long 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.849
 every year had fights that's going 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.229
 have to try I still have home 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.479
 as we managed to be at the end of 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.949
 season last year and then and then 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.330
 that's like I said it anyway 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.330
 approached maintaining as soon as possible
