00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 the angular forest of monsters 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.030
 neutral players and also some champions 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.250
 the target is a very distinct area on the site 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.500
 and it's one of the things that makes her 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.230
 be unique game compared to other 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.449
 fashions in the forest there are several 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 important goals that almost always 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.170
 they end up giving the victory to the team that has 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.510
 greater control of them 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.090
 basically the forest consists of three 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.279
 dead fields have two fields of nery 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.210
 ancient monsters and two 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.130
 monsters apps 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.800
 Fields are places where monsters 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 arise Forest mirrored by 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.340
 so many fields that require one side of the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.410
 river also said in the other with the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.600
 difference that their inverted positions 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.530
 these monsters always appear in the same 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 place 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.480
 so if you kill the wolves after 50 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 seconds they will be there again and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 contrary to games where some monsters 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850
 are shy and do not show up when you are 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.829
 always seeing friends monsters 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 appeared 50 seconds after you 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.489
 to defeat them independently you are 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.260
 looking for them or not 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.879
 Good now that you know more or less 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.309
 what are the fields and where are they 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.439
 located the smaller fields arise the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 crazy that are composed of a wolf 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.490
 giant and two smaller 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 the new giant offers 55 gold and the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 smaller four each 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.360
 also appear the two goals the greater 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.270
 of them with 7 55 of gold the smaller 15 and the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.189
 aspects that are three minor phantoms 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.619
 in a bigger ghost being a ghost 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.390
 today's 30 the smallest three each 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.360
 these fields appear for the first time 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.579
 in the match in a minute 55 and resurge 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.369
 50 seconds after being defeated 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.200
 there are also action monster camps 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.030
 these monsters are much stronger than 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 the commons and grant the champion 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.860
 defeated powerful buffs between 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.299
 these donkeys are the red that causes 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.460
 damage and slowness an enemy that was 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.290
 hit by the basic attacks and the buffet 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.880
 blue giving you a lot of regeneration 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 demand per second and the size of the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.630
 watch out your skill these monsters 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.700
 appear five minutes after being 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.469
 defeated then the very large amount 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
 experience to be champion and thus 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.520
 if you defeat one of them at the beginning of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.210
 you'll get a level of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.190
 grace 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.750
 besides these monsters also have the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.399
 monsters apps that have large 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 advantages for your team 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.850
 these monsters are not defeated 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.410
 easily so you should ask 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.220
 help his team when fight 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.050
 against them 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.580
 one of them is the dragon that appears in two 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.230
 minutes and thirty party 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.910
 he is an extremely strong monster 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.280
 decreased attack speed when 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 reaches beyond causing tons of damage 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.239
 for attack when he shows dead him 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.790
 can not get any kind of buffy 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.060
 but he gives 190 gold for each of the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 his team so in total he can 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.780
 950 gold for your team what 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.430
 equals more than three pounds he 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.080
 resumes in six minutes after being 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.790
 defeated and usually in matches 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.709
 the team that defeated the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.600
 dragon is always the winner of the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.550
 the dragon, we also have the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
 baron who is a monster plus little 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.430
 flashes 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.650
 they appear 15 minutes of departure has 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.750
 nearly 9000 of life and their attacks beyond 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.459
 to reduce the damage you cause to the forest 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 the baron is a monster 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.640
 extremely strong 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.350
 usually the champions and it must be that 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.790
 for many holes to win 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.620
 robbed also have skills that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.959
 can pitch up to 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.340
 far beyond having acid rain that 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.920
 cause much damage to those who have been hit 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 when defeated he offers 300 gold 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.040
 for each champion in his type, ie a 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.900
 here for each 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.120
 in addition it also provides a 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.250
 powerful people regeneration damage of 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.220
 life and kills when you are under the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.140
 effect of the people for you will have 40 damage 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.970
 additional physical power 40 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.739
 additional ability of 3% 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.760
 regeneration of its maximum life by 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.560
 second 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.400
 regeneration of its maximum mana by 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.379
 good cycle as you saw previously 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 forest is a very diverse place appear 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.920
 several different monsters and they give you 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.750
 additional advantages so it is logical 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.700
 who is a champion could stay in the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.379
 forest the whole game and win 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.879
 experience enough money so that 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.500
 it will be worth one that is in the law 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.870
 the names of the champions staying in the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.730
 forest is from creek in Portuguese to 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.579
 translated as a jungle hunt but 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.829
 I prefer to call theirs flowers good 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.870
 florestans plays a very important role in 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.940
 interesting fun in the meta game of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.680
 in addition to forming the forest they 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.359
 are also always strolling around 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.519
 lenses disrupting the champions of 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.109
 enemies and setting ambush for them 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.670
 these champions are always facing 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.799
 The cold must have an enemy. 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.870
 therefore and becomes a game of chess is 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.459
 extremely complicated between Andrew 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.800
 although the creek does not carry alone 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.660
 a match is probably the role that 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.760
 will have greater impact on the game of logo and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.860
 even though blooming does not need the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.870
 snorer spell strike to make the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.910
 forest is highly recommended that 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.530
 You carry this spell if you want. 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.090
 get out of the forest first because 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.430
 it gives you additional control over 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.169
 monsters you want to kill without copying 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.180
 You can not guarantee that your team 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.880
 will give east retinha hill imagine only 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.620
 You are there killing for the without copying and 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.840
 An enemy comes from nothing and clothes and 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.580
 booth the advantage that the baron I bring 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.990
 offers more impact on how 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580
 match is in you not sure 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.530
 absolutely that you will achieve 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.930
 make sure your team has these books 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.090
 It's best that you do not even try 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.229
 this copy is required in a match 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.910
 competitive today andré o 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.919
 main character name until game the 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.870
 legend of legends metagame is a way 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.150
 of playing that surpasses the others or 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.889
 players who respect metagame will have 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.810
 advantage over those who did not respect 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.210
 for games league is misinterpreted at 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.400
 Sometimes some say positions are 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.320
 fixed but it's a lie but the game is 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.510
 focused on global objectives 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.580
 these the ones of angelman have bigger 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.979
 control so the main goal 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.139
 do keep control of the buff keep 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.539
 lens control and maintain control 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.120
 goals such as dragon and noise 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.310
 in this case jack 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.320
 plays the most important role because 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.780
 without it there would be no control of the boxes 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.520
 objectives and, moreover, 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.810
 sometimes if nobody was going badly 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.160
 can help 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.160
 some people say that actually 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.760
 meta game is what I want in the pot and bruno 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.650
 top 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.750
 This is a lie as we see the scene. 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.850
 several times the change of 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.830
 lenny and roles but we never see the 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.540
 absence of an andré in the game 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.100
 so it is also the fault generally 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.050
 deposited in the jânio he is the character 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.479
 that has greater influence in the game who 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.699
 should actively take care that 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.590
 everything is going well in the match 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.330
 jander also gives meaning to other 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.830
 positions such as the support that 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.630
 have to take care that the objectives 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.550
 are protected as is the case with the 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.380
 dragon in addition to flying says to prevent 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.630
 Johnny the enemy can move 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.490
 freely if we compare the link with a 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.650
 django read football game would be the 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.150
 steering wheel that creates the plays and the support 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.900
 the goalkeeper who must prevent them from 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.760
 happen 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.410
 so the next time you go to play 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.320
 one league game and remember before 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.030
 to blame as well as his position will be 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.410
 more important it is also more 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.220
 pressed and difficult to be 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.220
 played
