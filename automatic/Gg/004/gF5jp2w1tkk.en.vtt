00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:10.219
 Hey 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.210
 i 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:01:01.460
 I'm not thinking of you earn 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.920
 ability to play a game of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.610
 a sensational franchise that Indian 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.479
 jones is virtually impossible 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.920
 go wrong and then you'll end up with everything you 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.600
 creates crap 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.270
 You run away with the dream of several children. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.810
 This game is a love that my first 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.170
 contact with the Indian jones and was 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.030
 desperate 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.369
 This Indian jones the master team 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.710
 system I rented because I had already played 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.680
 closed everything the store had to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.250
 offer suggestions place the games that 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.800
 the tapes were very expensive there 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.429
 by the 90s one can not imagine the deception 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 is a game without music and that it reminded 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.400
 a super nintendo fan kit 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.090
 one of the first games to grow and 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.030
 randy moss traumas also the only song 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.299
 This game is when you die or 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.880
 the stage begins and the theme song opens 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.610
 that at the beginning of the game at least this 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.280
 and so with a little good life 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.299
 indiana jones limited 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.320
 nothing adventurous because outside it falls from 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:20.540
 High dies can not swim and control 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.720
 in the gameplay is very truncated one 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.120
 The way you do not have it 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.280
 hello and hold on the strings that stayed 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.030
 as dangerous as doing it in life 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.350
 real you have to kill the enemies in the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.030
 punch 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.890
 with luck you can find a weapon 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.650
 but most of the time you need 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.750
 face crazy drugs in the punch then 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.370
 if the shot goes to hell and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.590
 practically killed the moment you 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.090
 have to lower the bar and then the Indian 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.090
 jones and matrix 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.650
 Tata Timeout makes us stand alone 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.799
 to forget the difficult umbrella right? 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.200
 to leave challenging 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.299
 the graphics means that they are 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.799
 interesting yes i am talking master 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.400
 system 8 bits 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.700
 remembers until the star wars of the master system 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.459
 also in case of bad play and 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.260
 This becomes a problem because you see 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.379
 the game screen and think it's cool today 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.049
 on a video game play day the club does not 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.609
 but when you only had static image 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.280
 on the cover back were you there for a 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.329
 exercise of luck that the game could be 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.329
 a bomb 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.060
 It's the case of Joe I played very short, right? 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:37.409
 At least that but it makes them hell 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.269
 I did not go through the first phase when 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.879
 I played for the first time from the south have passed 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.139
 ten years later we are already affected by the 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:49.170
 world using everything that was method for 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.689
 to achieve this is not saving is really 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.450
 orlando you survive the caves of 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.940
 first phase in which they offer a good 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.799
 sample of reality indicating us 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.010
 even where is the exit you out 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.690
 wandering you going to the train like that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.769
 as happens at the end of the year to jones and 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.129
 last crusade 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.519
 except for the fact that in the game you're 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.650
 playing with indiana old jones a scene 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.739
 which shows him young cinema 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.530
 Okay fine, because it takes a lot but you 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.340
 kills the Indians flee animal follows in 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.669
 front 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.240
 and no maze is fine but there 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:30.690
 some phases and Teixeira in the end 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.409
 single phase is actually the second phase 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.750
 from the train 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.770
 Then you arrive at the end a straight phase 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.360
 you have a game takes an angle is a 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.260
 personality 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.770
 the taste of the game birÃ¡n street fight and there 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.919
 all this in music yet you were a 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:54.780
 the ridiculous platforms but this is 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.190
 dodge several saws on the ground this 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.860
 do not even have a movie 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.930
 There you go through a letter 's' assholes 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.090
 that if you follow the order you get the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.650
 cup and then you have to go with some more 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150
 plants 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.250
 Let's take some more dangerous leaps. 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.139
 to risk losing everything is because the 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.990
 game did this just because you have the 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.240
 happy to die to reset the game and is 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.770
 finally you're done and then you have a 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.949
 indiana jones with a face of 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.289
 Jesus' little thing and his father on the 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.330
 introduction music of phase 1 dengue 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.820
 The game is over, you're done. 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.759
 lose a few hours of your life a 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.310
 entire childhood and there for not death 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.560
 celebral anyone determines that seeped 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.080
 to stay away from this game because it is 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.889
 a player who is going to say goodbye 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.470

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.990
