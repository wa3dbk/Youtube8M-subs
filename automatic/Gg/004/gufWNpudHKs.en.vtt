00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.860
 The upper part of the arch from questions from the problem was in May 2010 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.010
 Let's try to get it done once. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.099
 You asked a lot of arches. 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:22.289
 Well, it's not so difficult. First of all, 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.130
 Information hasyeoseo doeneundeyo need you yeah 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130
 First Leg Teng global 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 The size of the consultation is how much you give up 902. The height of 900 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.590
 You have to think about this for about 2100 . 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.420
 So if you think about it, I'll give you 900 . 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.580
 Please enter 2100 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.930
 So now that you are viewing is here and now arch deuleogandago here 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.990
 You can think of it. 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.950
 So if you're in circles 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.950
 And one point 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.680
 You can grab it in there and draw something, but now here is the 2100 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.570
 That's it. 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.710
 What an example because the higher ground'll not screened in four minutes that's why 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.880
 You'll have to drop it. 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 Well , let's just come down to how we believe in the four main stores. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.100
 I'll just cut you guys off with the trim. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.970
 So this way it would be this size. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:33.590
 Sometimes, however, sometimes this size is full of cancer. 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.560
 If so arbitrarily far from where I am now, I have several 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.530
 2100, but how much do you 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.220
 Yes, you can have 1800 people. 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.860
 It's hard to overcome , so you can make it happen. 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.150
 So what do you do here? Line 6 at this direction. Brick 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.870
 How much is one size? We have 5 of 90 in 190, 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:04.100
 Do 190 lines like this one. 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:08.690
 190 pad was also quite spacious 90th in Daegu what could have built rice Jin Woo Table 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.700
 Since three kicks because you're tiny little 190 I should hit 190 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.150
 I'm back. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 So you can go back to the ar array. 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.420
 So let me choose an example with select and I 'll turn to Paula . 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:27.140
 The circular center point, of course, when I catch a'll have two of the circle 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.480
 Well, then, you do it with your eyes. 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:36.769
 It's 580 or 182 . 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:42.050
 So what do you do with size 12 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:47.090
 I am going to take a look at the three companies and the weaponry, 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.140
 Hasyeoseo seems reasonable to the extent Ayu So unless it's 22 something 23 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.880
 You 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.790
 Did that fit us so because 23 groups eolchu I'm doing good 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.890
 Then, after pressing OK, 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:05.120
 This is offset by 190 or 190 yieoteunikka you go doegetneyo 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.890
 So go to 190 or so would have made the arch itself 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:15.320
 If you look just it said the first arch is small Rub a long induction was at 90, so 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.920
 If I was like me , it would be too big , 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.910
 I did 90. 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:28.500
 So how do you guys make a demand of 90 then? 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:31.360
 For from the beginning not just in the wrong because I look so trim a yogeo 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.770
 You can come back to me. 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:40.660
 Well, the size is brick news, or it 'll be nice to turn around. 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.860
 It's your mind, so do not think about the shape, and you will be construed like this . 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.860
 I think you guys will.
