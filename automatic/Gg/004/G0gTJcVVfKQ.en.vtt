this<00:03:37.079> style<00:03:37.410> that's<00:03:37.829> right<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.290> need<00:03:40.290> to

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
this style that's right so I need to

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.460 
this style that's right so I need to
match<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.610> door<00:03:41.880> surrounds<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.140> bikini

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
match the door surrounds to the bikini

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.370 
match the door surrounds to the bikini
top<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.340> bikini<00:03:44.730> top<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.320> consider<00:03:46.320> what

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
top to the bikini top and consider what

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.479 
top to the bikini top and consider what
kind<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.709> header<00:03:46.890> you're<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> put<00:03:47.400> on

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
kind of header you're going to put on

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.449 
kind of header you're going to put on
the<00:03:47.610> vehicle<00:03:47.940> got<00:03:48.390> it

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
the vehicle got it

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.750 
the vehicle got it
so<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.670> one<00:03:51.819> first<00:03:52.030> okay<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.980> is<00:03:54.250> sort<00:03:54.700> of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
so this one first okay this is sort of

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.850 
so this one first okay this is sort of
the<00:03:54.880> standard<00:03:55.240> JK<00:03:55.900> header<00:03:56.110> right<00:03:56.350> that's

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
the standard JK header right that's

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.960 
the standard JK header right that's
right<00:03:57.100> this<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.340> going<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.580> be<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.790> header

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
right this is going to be the header

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.520 
right this is going to be the header
that<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.270> use<00:03:58.450> for<00:03:58.480> anything<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.050> does<00:03:59.319> not

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
that you use for anything that does not

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.690 
that you use for anything that does not
require<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.069> cable<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:02.350> if<00:04:02.560> i<00:04:02.830> have<00:04:03.069> any<00:04:03.400> cheap

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
require a cable so if i have any cheap

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.180 
require a cable so if i have any cheap
that<00:04:03.850> does<00:04:04.000> not<00:04:04.209> have<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.569> cable<00:04:04.870> top<00:04:05.050> i<00:04:05.319> would

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
that does not have the cable top i would

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.680 
that does not have the cable top i would
get<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.459> one<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:07.000> would<00:04:07.150> be<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.390> one<00:04:07.540> that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
get this one this would be the one that

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.880 
get this one this would be the one that
you<00:04:07.780> want<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.020> get<00:04:08.200> ya<00:04:08.410> something<00:04:08.709> that's

you want to get ya something that's

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.110 
you want to get ya something that's
going<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.040> either<00:04:09.190> clip<00:04:09.520> into<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.940> door

be attached straight to the roll bar
okay<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:19.060> fabric<00:04:19.299> from<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.900> bikini<00:04:20.200> is

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
okay and the fabric from the bikini is

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.380 
okay and the fabric from the bikini is
going<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.709> attach<00:04:20.980> to<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.370> that's<00:04:22.120> right

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
going to attach to this that's right

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.330 
going to attach to this that's right
this<00:04:22.630> will<00:04:22.810> mount<00:04:23.050> directly<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.950> top<00:04:24.310> of

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
this will mount directly to the top of

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.830 
this will mount directly to the top of
the<00:04:24.640> windshield<00:04:24.910> where<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.419> clamped<00:04:25.810> down

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
the windshield where it's clamped down

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.810 
the windshield where it's clamped down
to<00:04:26.110> hold<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.560> place<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.250> fabric<00:04:27.669> will

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
to hold it in place and the fabric will

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.050 
to hold it in place and the fabric will
snap<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.650> along<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.890> edge<00:04:30.640> of<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.880> header

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
snap to it along the edge of the header

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.080 
snap to it along the edge of the header
this<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.840> really<00:04:32.050> clamp<00:04:32.320> down<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.650> smart

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
this is it really clamp down it smart

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.909 
this is it really clamp down it smart
well<00:04:34.090> there's<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.419> bracket<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.320> a<00:04:35.500> knob<00:04:35.710> that

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
well there's a bracket and a knob that

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.240 
well there's a bracket and a knob that
you<00:04:36.070> use<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.280> tighten<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.910> into<00:04:37.090> place<00:04:37.300> got<00:04:37.630> it

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
you use to tighten it into place got it

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.590 
you use to tighten it into place got it
so<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.460> one<00:04:39.640> requires<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:40.060> little<00:04:40.480> bit<00:04:40.570> of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
so this one requires a little bit of

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.090 
so this one requires a little bit of
assembly<00:04:41.110> on<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.320> windshield<00:04:41.560> header<00:04:41.740> first

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
assembly on the windshield header first

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.710 
assembly on the windshield header first
that's<00:04:42.520> right<00:04:42.790> after<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.210> get<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.479> there's<00:04:43.660> a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
that's right after you get it there's a

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.210 
that's right after you get it there's a
couple<00:04:43.930> brackets<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.620> you'll<00:04:44.740> have<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.040> put

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
couple brackets that you'll have to put

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.310 
couple brackets that you'll have to put
on<00:04:45.370> here<00:04:45.700> in<00:04:45.820> order<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.479> assemble<00:04:47.020> that

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
on here in order to assemble that

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.840 
on here in order to assemble that
alright<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:48.370> once<00:04:48.580> you've<00:04:48.700> got<00:04:48.820> that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
alright so once you've got that

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.600 
alright so once you've got that
assembled<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:50.229> just<00:04:50.470> snap<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.800> fabric<00:04:51.460> onto

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
assembled you just snap the fabric onto

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.980 
assembled you just snap the fabric onto
that<00:04:51.790> that's<00:04:52.150> right<00:04:52.419> you'll<00:04:52.570> put<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.810> fabric

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
that that's right you'll put the fabric

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.960 
that that's right you'll put the fabric
around<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.590> edge<00:04:53.740> you<00:04:53.979> snap<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.280> in<00:04:54.490> place<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
around the edge you snap it in place and

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.000 
around the edge you snap it in place and
then<00:04:55.510> clamp<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.050> down<00:04:56.080> using<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.620> knobs<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
then clamp it down using the knobs and

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.290 
then clamp it down using the knobs and
the<00:04:57.070> brackets<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.580> are<00:04:57.610> in<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.850> kid<00:04:58.030> okay<00:04:58.240> so

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
the brackets that are in the kid okay so

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.890 
the brackets that are in the kid okay so
that's<00:04:58.750> fairly<00:04:59.080> straightforward
