hi<00:00:09.570> I'm<00:00:10.019> Cory<00:00:10.350> from<00:00:10.469> IT<00:00:10.680> parks<00:00:10.950> comm<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.580> in

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
hi I'm Cory from IT parks comm and in

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.799 
hi I'm Cory from IT parks comm and in
this<00:00:11.760> video<00:00:12.000> we're<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> replace<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
this video we're going to replace the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.340 
this video we're going to replace the
actuator<00:00:13.289> on<00:00:13.529> this<00:00:13.980> VNT<00:00:14.490> 15<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.779> turbo<00:00:16.230> is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
actuator on this VNT 15 this turbo is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.840 
actuator on this VNT 15 this turbo is
obviously<00:00:16.740> out<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.070> car<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.699> this

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
obviously out of a car you can do this

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.310 
obviously out of a car you can do this
on<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> car<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:18.689> bit<00:00:18.779> harder<00:00:19.109> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
on the car it's a little bit harder but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.599 
on the car it's a little bit harder but
we've<00:00:19.619> got<00:00:19.769> it<00:00:19.890> off<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> car<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.460> way<00:00:20.550> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
we've got it off the car that way you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.339 
we've got it off the car that way you
can<00:00:20.820> see<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:21.329> doing<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.169> same

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
can see what I'm doing it's the same

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.909 
can see what I'm doing it's the same
process<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.009> VM<00:00:23.279> T<00:00:23.400> 17<00:00:23.999> or<00:00:24.269> 17<00:00:25.079> 22<00:00:25.499> hybrid

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
process for a VM T 17 or 17 22 hybrid

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.890 
process for a VM T 17 or 17 22 hybrid
it's<00:00:26.249> pretty<00:00:26.490> easy<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.999> we<00:00:27.509> can<00:00:27.659> do<00:00:27.749> it<00:00:27.869> just

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's pretty easy and we can do it just

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.880 
it's pretty easy and we can do it just
in<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.230> few<00:00:28.380> minutes<00:00:30.439> first<00:00:31.439> thing<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:31.769> going

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
in a few minutes first thing we're going

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.290 
in a few minutes first thing we're going
to<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> small<00:00:33.000> flat-head

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to do is take a small flat-head

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.110 
to do is take a small flat-head
screwdriver<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> pick<00:00:34.980> tool<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.489> remove

well
the<00:00:46.440> circle<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.950> went<00:00:47.100> flying<00:00:47.340> but

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the circle if just went flying but

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.190 
the circle if just went flying but
that's<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.750> normal

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that's pretty normal

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.690 
that's pretty normal
don't<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.620> too<00:00:49.740> stressed<00:00:50.040> out<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.400> you<00:00:50.490> get<00:00:50.610> an

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
don't be too stressed out if you get an

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
don't be too stressed out if you get an
actuator<00:00:50.970> from<00:00:51.270> us<00:00:51.330> a<00:00:51.420> tidy<00:00:51.540> parts<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.960> include

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actuator from us a tidy parts we include

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
actuator from us a tidy parts we include
a<00:00:52.380> new<00:00:52.560> circle<00:00:52.950> up<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.220> you<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.910> you'd

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
a new circle up for you that way you'd

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.220 
a new circle up for you that way you'd
also<00:00:54.150> spend<00:00:54.420> an<00:00:54.480> hour<00:00:54.540> looking<00:00:54.900> for<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> old

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
also spend an hour looking for the old

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
also spend an hour looking for the old
one<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> circlip<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.180> we'll

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one now that the circlip is off we'll

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.630 
one now that the circlip is off we'll
continue<00:00:57.510> removing<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.230> actuator<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.860> next

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
continue removing the actuator the next

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
continue removing the actuator the next
thing<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.850> need<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> remove<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> two<00:01:01.320> 10

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
thing we need to do is remove the two 10

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
thing we need to do is remove the two 10
millimeter<00:01:01.650> nuts<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.730> hold<00:01:02.880> the<00:01:03.030> actuator

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
millimeter nuts that hold the actuator

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:30.389 
millimeter nuts that hold the actuator
to<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> bracket

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.529 

with<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.460> nuts<00:01:31.640> out<00:01:31.729> of<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> way<00:01:32.149> we<00:01:32.360> can

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
with the nuts out of the way we can

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.969 
with the nuts out of the way we can
slide<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.259> excavator<00:01:33.799> off<00:01:35.710> put<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
slide the excavator off put it to the

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.370 
slide the excavator off put it to the
side<00:01:37.329> we<00:01:38.329> have<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.539> old<00:01:38.659> heat<00:01:38.929> shield<00:01:39.200> here

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
side we have the old heat shield here

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.139 
side we have the old heat shield here
that<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.619> took<00:01:39.770> off<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.070> old<00:01:40.100> actuator<00:01:40.700> we

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
that we took off the old actuator we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.399 
that we took off the old actuator we
have<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> put<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> new<00:01:41.960> actuator

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
have to put that on the new actuator

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.200 
have to put that on the new actuator
before<00:01:42.740> installing<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.340> turbo<00:01:43.640> you'll

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
before installing on the turbo you'll

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.450 
before installing on the turbo you'll
find<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.539> small<00:01:44.659> vent<00:01:45.140> hole<00:01:45.439> right<00:01:45.860> here<00:01:46.189> on<00:01:46.340> the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
find a small vent hole right here on the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.219 
find a small vent hole right here on the
outside<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.000> actuator<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.600> that's<00:01:48.049> going

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
outside of the actuator and that's going

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.529 
outside of the actuator and that's going
to<00:01:48.319> be<00:01:48.500> protected<00:01:49.009> by<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.159> shield<00:01:49.539> simply

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
to be protected by the shield simply

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.620 
to be protected by the shield simply
slide<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.020> shield<00:01:51.229> over<00:01:52.240> line<00:01:53.240> up<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> two

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
slide the shield over line up the two

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.480 
slide the shield over line up the two
holes<00:01:53.840> for<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.020> nuts<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.679> that's<00:01:55.189> all<00:01:55.340> there

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
holes for the nuts and that's all there

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.249 
holes for the nuts and that's all there
is<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:55.819> you<00:01:56.659> also<00:01:56.689> want<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:56.990> be<00:01:57.079> sure<00:01:57.229> that

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
is to that you also want to be sure that

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.529 
is to that you also want to be sure that
this<00:01:57.500> lock<00:01:57.920> nut<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.700> adjusting<00:01:59.179> screw<00:01:59.210> is

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
this lock nut and the adjusting screw is

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.389 
this lock nut and the adjusting screw is
also<00:01:59.780> loose<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.259> easy<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.590> turn<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.159> going<00:02:01.340> to

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
also loose and easy to turn is going to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.460 
also loose and easy to turn is going to
be<00:02:01.490> harder<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.819> turn<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.780> adjust<00:02:02.990> when<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
be harder to turn and adjust when the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.380 
be harder to turn and adjust when the
thing<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.679> installed<00:02:04.459> on<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.819> turbocharger

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
thing is installed on the turbocharger

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.419 
thing is installed on the turbocharger
so<00:02:05.630> we<00:02:06.259> can<00:02:06.409> free<00:02:06.590> them<00:02:06.740> up<00:02:06.860> now<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.340> maybe

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
so we can free them up now and maybe

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.069 
so we can free them up now and maybe
adds<00:02:07.849> a<00:02:08.030> little<00:02:08.119> bit<00:02:08.269> lubrication<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> make<00:02:08.959> it

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
adds a little bit lubrication to make it

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.319 
adds a little bit lubrication to make it
easier<00:02:09.349> once<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:09.950> install<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.000> with<00:02:11.180> those

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
easier once we install it but with those

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.000 
easier once we install it but with those
in<00:02:11.510> place<00:02:11.690> we'll<00:02:11.930> go<00:02:12.049> ahead<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.319> put<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.799> took

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
in place we'll go ahead and put the took

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.740 
in place we'll go ahead and put the took
the<00:02:13.040> actuator<00:02:13.519> here<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.269> turbocharger

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the actuator here on the turbocharger

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.120 
the actuator here on the turbocharger
bracket<00:02:17.079> when<00:02:18.079> we<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.680> want<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> line

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
bracket when we do that we want to line

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.280 
bracket when we do that we want to line
up<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> bracket<00:02:19.579> with<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.329> exhaust<00:02:20.900> side<00:02:21.110> of

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
up the bracket with the exhaust side of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.630 
up the bracket with the exhaust side of
the<00:02:21.349> turbo<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.890> Brak<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.250> kind<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.610> a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the turbo this Brak is kind of like a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.610 
the turbo this Brak is kind of like a
heat<00:02:22.819> shield<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.989> exhaust<00:02:24.349> side<00:02:24.530> is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
heat shield and the exhaust side is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.900 
heat shield and the exhaust side is
gonna<00:02:24.709> be<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:24.890> hot<00:02:25.010> end<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.370> turbo<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.849> it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
gonna be the hot end of the turbo so it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.550 
gonna be the hot end of the turbo so it
needs<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> protect<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.480> from<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.750> first

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
needs to protect it from that first

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.580 
needs to protect it from that first
thing<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:27.769> need<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.130> catch<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
thing we need to do is catch the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.090 
thing we need to do is catch the

that into place once we're done with

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.559 
that into place once we're done with
that<00:02:44.810> we'll<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.350> catch<00:02:45.680> these<00:02:45.920> two<00:02:46.329> nuts<00:02:47.329> to

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
that we'll just catch these two nuts to

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.420 
that we'll just catch these two nuts to
be<00:02:47.660> sure<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.930> thing<00:02:48.319> doesn't<00:02:48.590> fall<00:02:48.739> off<00:02:51.430> once

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
be sure that thing doesn't fall off once

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.629 
be sure that thing doesn't fall off once
we<00:02:52.489> have<00:02:52.639> the<00:02:52.730> nuts<00:02:52.910> caught<00:02:53.209> we'll<00:02:53.780> take<00:02:54.079> the

the actuator arm attached to the lever

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.730 
the actuator arm attached to the lever
will<00:03:49.390> now<00:03:49.570> go<00:03:49.930> through<00:03:50.110> adjusting<00:03:50.650> the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
will now go through adjusting the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.110 
will now go through adjusting the
actuator<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.250> be<00:03:51.340> sure<00:03:51.490> it's<00:03:51.640> within<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
actuator to be sure it's within the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.110 
actuator to be sure it's within the
proper<00:03:52.420> response<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:53.610> adjust<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.730> actuator

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
proper response to adjust the actuator

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.430 
proper response to adjust the actuator
we're<00:03:55.270> going<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.450> use<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.660> mityvac<00:03:56.080> it's<00:03:56.380> a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
we're going to use a mityvac it's a

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.620 
we're going to use a mityvac it's a
small<00:03:56.710> hand<00:03:57.190> powered<00:03:57.550> vacuum<00:03:57.730> pump<00:03:58.180> with<00:03:58.600> a

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
small hand powered vacuum pump with a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.300 
small hand powered vacuum pump with a
gauge<00:03:58.900> on<00:03:59.080> it<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.350> way<00:03:59.470> we<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.800> see<00:03:59.950> how<00:03:59.980> much

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
gauge on it that way we can see how much

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.590 
gauge on it that way we can see how much
vacuum<00:04:00.610> we're<00:04:00.910> applying<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.330> actuator

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
vacuum we're applying to the actuator

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.030 
vacuum we're applying to the actuator
and<00:04:01.990> watch<00:04:02.290> how<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.620> moves

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
and watch how it moves

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.770 
and watch how it moves
we<00:04:03.430> haven't<00:04:03.760> tightened<00:04:04.090> down<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.360> lock<00:04:04.570> nut

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
we haven't tightened down this lock nut

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.580 
we haven't tightened down this lock nut
yet<00:04:04.960> because<00:04:05.140> we're<00:04:05.230> going<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.410> have<00:04:05.500> to

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
yet because we're going to have to

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.630 
yet because we're going to have to
adjust<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.130> we'll<00:04:06.250> see<00:04:06.430> where<00:04:06.550> the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
adjust it but we'll see where the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.900 
adjust it but we'll see where the
actuator<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.090> right<00:04:07.450> now<00:04:08.400> attach<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.580> mityvac

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
actuator is right now attach the mityvac

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.390 
actuator is right now attach the mityvac
to<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.180> actuator<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.800> we'll<00:04:11.920> do<00:04:12.040> some<00:04:12.220> hand

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
to the actuator and we'll do some hand

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:30.420 
to the actuator and we'll do some hand
pumping<00:04:12.700> here

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.340 

what<00:04:30.880> we're<00:04:31.090> looking<00:04:31.330> for<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.110> when

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
what we're looking for is to see when

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.350 
what we're looking for is to see when
the<00:04:32.470> actuator<00:04:32.860> starts<00:04:33.190> moving<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.669> how<00:04:34.210> much

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the actuator starts moving and how much

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.150 
the actuator starts moving and how much
vacuum<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.290> takes<00:04:35.530> for<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.740> actuator<00:04:36.070> to

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
vacuum it takes for the actuator to

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.860 
vacuum it takes for the actuator to
reach<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.699> turbocharger<00:04:37.240> stop<00:04:37.449> it<00:04:37.630> is<00:04:37.720> right

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
reach the turbocharger stop it is right

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.070 
reach the turbocharger stop it is right
here

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.900 

now<00:04:41.080> on<00:04:41.380> this<00:04:41.740> turbocharger<00:04:42.340> we<00:04:42.430> just<00:04:42.610> noticed

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
now on this turbocharger we just noticed

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.909 
now on this turbocharger we just noticed
that<00:04:42.970> while<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.660> moves<00:04:43.900> originally<00:04:44.470> we<00:04:44.680> could

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
that while it moves originally we could

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.499 
that while it moves originally we could
never<00:04:45.160> get<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.639> touch<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.270> stock

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
never get it to touch the the stock

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.020 
never get it to touch the the stock
which<00:04:46.930> means<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.350> actuator<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.889> too<00:04:48.130> long<00:04:48.430> if

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
which means the actuator is too long if

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.120 
which means the actuator is too long if
you<00:04:49.180> want<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.600> actuator<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.470> touch<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.949> stop

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
you want the actuator to touch the stop

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.920 
you want the actuator to touch the stop
earlier<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.940> need<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.150> shorten<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.539> actuator

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
earlier you need to shorten the actuator

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.719 
earlier you need to shorten the actuator
if<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.410> want<00:04:53.620> if<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.830> touches<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.280> stop<00:04:54.490> too

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
if you want if it touches the stop too

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.330 
if you want if it touches the stop too
early<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.360> need<00:04:55.449> a<00:04:55.539> length<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:55.990> actuator

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
early you need a length of the actuator

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.400 
early you need a length of the actuator
that<00:04:57.340> translates<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:57.940> boost<00:04:58.240> as<00:04:58.449> well<00:04:58.479> if<00:04:58.840> your

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
that translates to boost as well if your

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.870 
that translates to boost as well if your
car<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.590> under<00:05:00.130> boosting<00:05:00.490> you'll<00:05:00.669> need<00:05:00.789> to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
car is under boosting you'll need to

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.550 
car is under boosting you'll need to
shorten<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.270> actuator<00:05:01.690> if<00:05:01.900> your<00:05:02.020> car<00:05:02.139> is<00:05:02.169> over

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
shorten the actuator if your car is over

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.600 
shorten the actuator if your car is over
boosting<00:05:02.889> you'll<00:05:03.010> need<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.250> lengthen<00:05:03.430> the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
boosting you'll need to lengthen the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.400 
boosting you'll need to lengthen the
actuator<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.270> more<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.870> lever<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.380> moved

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
actuator the more that lever is moved

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.170 
actuator the more that lever is moved
the<00:05:05.949> more<00:05:06.100> boost<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.550> turbocharger<00:05:07.030> will

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
the more boost the turbocharger will

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.700 
the more boost the turbocharger will
create<00:05:09.750> well<00:05:10.750> adjust<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.110> actual<00:05:11.350> rotor<00:05:11.560> by

create well adjust the actual rotor by

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.020 
create well adjust the actual rotor by
first<00:05:11.979> just<00:05:12.070> moving<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.490> lock<00:05:12.639> nut<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.850> little

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
first just moving the lock nut a little

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.379 
first just moving the lock nut a little
bit<00:05:13.120> out<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.389> way<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:14.280> we'll<00:05:15.280> rotate<00:05:15.699> the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
bit out of the way and we'll rotate the

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:42.269 
bit out of the way and we'll rotate the
adjuster<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:18.340> actuator

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.159 

all<00:05:42.729> right<00:05:43.059> we<00:05:43.179> just<00:05:43.359> took<00:05:43.449> about<00:05:43.659> two<00:05:43.899> threads

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
all right we just took about two threads

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.079 
all right we just took about two threads
up<00:05:44.349> we<00:05:44.529> want<00:05:44.739> to<00:05:44.799> test<00:05:45.009> again<00:05:45.309> one<00:05:45.849> or<00:05:45.969> two

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
up we want to test again one or two

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.129 
up we want to test again one or two
threads<00:05:46.329> can<00:05:46.479> make<00:05:46.569> a<00:05:46.629> pretty<00:05:46.839> big<00:05:47.019> difference

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
threads can make a pretty big difference

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.559 
threads can make a pretty big difference
in<00:05:47.499> this<00:05:47.619> adjustment<00:05:48.189> so<00:05:48.309> check<00:05:48.759> before<00:05:49.449> you

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
in this adjustment so check before you

00:05:49.569 --> 00:06:20.400 
in this adjustment so check before you
go<00:05:49.659> too<00:05:49.719> far<00:05:54.749> not<00:05:55.749> connected

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.870 

that's<00:06:21.410> pretty<00:06:21.620> close<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.889> perfect<00:06:22.009> we're<00:06:22.669> at

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
that's pretty close to perfect we're at

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.969 
that's pretty close to perfect we're at
about<00:06:23.300> 18<00:06:23.750> inches<00:06:23.930> of<00:06:24.199> mercury<00:06:24.350> on<00:06:24.650> the<00:06:24.770> gauge

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
about 18 inches of mercury on the gauge

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.920 
about 18 inches of mercury on the gauge
and<00:06:25.250> we're<00:06:25.639> nearly<00:06:25.850> at<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.180> step<00:06:26.509> I'm<00:06:26.720> going

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
and we're nearly at the step I'm going

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.809 
and we're nearly at the step I'm going
to<00:06:26.990> take<00:06:27.169> one<00:06:27.560> more<00:06:27.710> thread<00:06:27.979> add<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.370> test<00:06:28.729> it

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
to take one more thread add and test it

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:47.309 
to take one more thread add and test it
one<00:06:28.940> more<00:06:29.060> time

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.140 

perfect<00:06:48.319> 18<00:06:49.009> inches<00:06:49.220> of<00:06:49.370> mercury<00:06:49.490> it<00:06:49.849> hit<00:06:50.030> the

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
perfect 18 inches of mercury it hit the

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.760 
perfect 18 inches of mercury it hit the
stop<00:06:50.389> that's<00:06:50.810> right<00:06:51.080> where<00:06:51.229> I<00:06:51.259> want<00:06:51.470> it<00:06:51.560> to<00:06:51.650> be

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
stop that's right where I want it to be

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.100 
stop that's right where I want it to be
anywhere<00:06:52.190> between<00:06:52.310> 15<00:06:52.759> 18<00:06:53.060> is<00:06:53.180> good<00:06:53.330> 18<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.080> a

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
anywhere between 15 18 is good 18 is a

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.210 
anywhere between 15 18 is good 18 is a
little<00:06:54.259> bit<00:06:54.349> more<00:06:54.470> on<00:06:54.560> the<00:06:54.680> safe<00:06:54.830> side<00:06:54.860> though

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
little bit more on the safe side though

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.100 
little bit more on the safe side though
so<00:06:55.460> I'm<00:06:55.820> going<00:06:56.030> to<00:06:56.090> set<00:06:56.240> that<00:06:56.270> at<00:06:56.509> 18<00:06:56.840> and<00:06:56.990> leave

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
so I'm going to set that at 18 and leave

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.050 
so I'm going to set that at 18 and leave
it<00:06:57.229> once<00:06:57.949> we<00:06:58.099> have<00:06:58.220> the<00:06:58.340> adjustment<00:06:58.580> set<00:06:58.849> we'll

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
it once we have the adjustment set we'll

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.700 
it once we have the adjustment set we'll
just<00:06:59.240> tighten<00:06:59.389> down<00:06:59.539> that<00:06:59.900> lock<00:07:00.139> nut<00:07:00.380> you

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
just tighten down that lock nut you

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.020 
just tighten down that lock nut you
don't<00:07:00.860> need<00:07:00.979> too<00:07:01.130> much<00:07:01.250> tightness<00:07:01.669> on<00:07:01.789> it<00:07:01.940> you

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
don't need too much tightness on it you

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.339 
don't need too much tightness on it you
can<00:07:02.150> damage<00:07:02.360> the<00:07:02.509> thing<00:07:02.810> pretty<00:07:02.990> easily<00:07:03.199> so

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
can damage the thing pretty easily so

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.140 
can damage the thing pretty easily so
just<00:07:04.009> tighten<00:07:04.250> it<00:07:04.430> down<00:07:04.460> enough<00:07:04.759> that<00:07:04.789> way<00:07:05.030> the

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
just tighten it down enough that way the

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:15.460 
just tighten it down enough that way the
arm<00:07:05.479> won't<00:07:05.780> move

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.540 

all<00:07:16.470> right<00:07:16.560> with<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:16.800> locknut<00:07:17.070> type<00:07:17.280> I'm<00:07:17.430> just

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
all right with the locknut type I'm just

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.650 
all right with the locknut type I'm just
going<00:07:17.669> to<00:07:17.730> double-check<00:07:17.970> these<00:07:18.180> two<00:07:18.419> here

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
going to double-check these two here

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.710 
going to double-check these two here
again<00:07:18.900> one<00:07:19.050> more<00:07:19.110> time<00:07:20.330> that's<00:07:21.330> it

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
again one more time that's it

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.450 
again one more time that's it
in<00:07:21.810> this<00:07:22.139> video<00:07:22.410> we<00:07:22.620> replace<00:07:22.980> this<00:07:23.160> actuator

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
in this video we replace this actuator

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.730 
in this video we replace this actuator
we<00:07:23.880> adjusted<00:07:24.300> it<00:07:24.419> using<00:07:24.630> a<00:07:24.660> mityvac<00:07:25.050> and<00:07:25.320> we're

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
we adjusted it using a mityvac and we're

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.300 
we adjusted it using a mityvac and we're
good<00:07:25.889> to<00:07:26.010> go

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
good to go

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.950
