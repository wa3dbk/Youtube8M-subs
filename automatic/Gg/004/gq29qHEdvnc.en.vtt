00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.440 
it I haven't even opened my notes I'm
very<00:01:07.049> prepared<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.950> video<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:09.210> biggest

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
very prepared for this video my biggest

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.410 
very prepared for this video my biggest
advice<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:12.119> whole

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
advice is to not see it as one whole

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
advice is to not see it as one whole
book<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.990> obviously<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.250> if

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
book and obviously it is but I think if

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
book and obviously it is but I think if
you<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> mentally<00:01:16.049> strategize<00:01:16.860> yourself

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you kind of mentally strategize yourself

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.480 
you kind of mentally strategize yourself
to<00:01:17.610> seeing<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.299> parts<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.830> lot<00:01:20.040> easier

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to seeing it as parts it's a lot easier

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
to seeing it as parts it's a lot easier
to<00:01:20.759> want<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> read<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> main

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to want to read it and that's the main

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
to want to read it and that's the main
deal<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.340> want<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> read<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
deal is you have to want to read it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
deal is you have to want to read it
because<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.659> soon<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.380> oh<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.890> at

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
because as soon as you go oh look at

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
because as soon as you go oh look at
this<00:01:26.100> huge<00:01:26.400> book<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.850> don't<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.390> think

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this huge book I don't I don't think

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
this huge book I don't I don't think
I'll<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.810> able<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> won't<00:01:29.070> enjoy

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
I'll be able that's when you won't enjoy

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.600 
I'll be able that's when you won't enjoy
it<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.329> into<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.650> certain<00:01:32.159> page

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it so just go into it with certain page

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
it so just go into it with certain page
goals<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.360> mind<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.259> about<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
goals in mind if you think about it

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.580 
goals in mind if you think about it
every<00:01:35.579> 300<00:01:36.150> pages<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.079> book

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
every 300 pages that's like a book

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.569 
every 300 pages that's like a book
within<00:01:37.799> itself<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.270> book<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.720> about<00:01:39.780> two

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
within itself so this book is about two

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.819

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
30 minutes but I can't so that would be

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.090 
30 minutes but I can't so that would be
an<00:03:16.120> unrealistic<00:03:16.450> goal<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:17.200> me<00:03:17.319> basically

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
an unrealistic goal for me basically

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.699 
an unrealistic goal for me basically
like<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.609> said<00:03:18.639> divide<00:03:19.329> it<00:03:19.480> into<00:03:19.630> chunks<00:03:20.049> divide

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
like I said divide it into chunks divide

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.870 
like I said divide it into chunks divide
and<00:03:21.069> conquer

you is to give yourself as much time as

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.370 
you is to give yourself as much time as

take too long with this I'm not gonna
get<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> other<00:03:39.970> one<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.299> what<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.810> recommend

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
get to the other one so what I recommend

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.460 
get to the other one so what I recommend
is<00:03:41.680> give<00:03:42.430> yourself<00:03:42.549> over<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.780> amount<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.169> time

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
is give yourself over the amount of time

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.259 
is give yourself over the amount of time
that<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.859> would<00:03:44.980> take<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.459> read<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.000> book

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
that it would take you to read this book

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.960 
that it would take you to read this book
before<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.349> plan<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.859> read<00:03:48.040> other<00:03:48.190> things<00:03:48.549> so

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
before you plan to read other things so

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.849 
before you plan to read other things so
for<00:03:49.269> example<00:03:49.599> if<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.780> read<00:03:49.959> ten<00:03:50.380> books<00:03:50.410> every

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
you think it will take because then you

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.150

four because it's you're blind you're

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.420 
four because it's you're blind you're
holding<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.229> it's<00:04:56.470> this<00:04:56.710> thickness<00:04:57.069> the

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
holding this it's this thickness the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.309 
holding this it's this thickness the
entire<00:04:57.729> time<00:04:58.060> so<00:04:58.090> maybe<00:04:58.599> if<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:58.870> don't<00:04:59.050> psych

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
entire time so maybe if you don't psych

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.459 
entire time so maybe if you don't psych
yourself<00:04:59.349> out<00:04:59.889> over<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.509> physical<00:05:01.509> size<00:05:02.229> of

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
yourself out over the physical size of

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.050 
yourself out over the physical size of
it<00:05:02.650> then<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:02.979> will<00:05:03.069> be<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.219> lot<00:05:03.400> easier<00:05:03.759> to<00:05:03.940> read
