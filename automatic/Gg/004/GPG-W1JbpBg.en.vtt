beads and put them on the paper board so
I'm<00:02:05.980> just<00:02:06.130> using<00:02:06.340> some<00:02:06.490> random<00:02:07.060> beads<00:02:07.480> out<00:02:07.720> of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
I'm just using some random beads out of

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.450 
I'm just using some random beads out of
this<00:02:08.020> big<00:02:08.260> container<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.890> them<00:02:09.010> but<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.280> can

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
this big container of them but you can

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.030 
this big container of them but you can
use<00:02:09.490> whatever<00:02:09.820> color<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.479> want<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.920> know

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
use whatever color you want so you know

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.170 
use whatever color you want so you know
it<00:02:12.160> should<00:02:12.340> look<00:02:12.460> something<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.880> this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
it should look something like this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.320 
it should look something like this
because<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.860> yet<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.460> just<00:02:15.490> outline<00:02:16.120> it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
because this is yet you just outline it

should look something like that and I
already<00:02:21.730> put<00:02:22.060> him<00:02:22.210> on<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> pegboard<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.320> in

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
already put him on the pegboard so in

stuff you can put into it but I'm just
making<00:02:49.570> three<00:02:50.080> layers<00:02:50.440> because<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.370> know<00:02:51.490> I

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
making three layers because you know I

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.040 
making three layers because you know I
don't<00:02:51.760> want<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:51.940> use<00:02:52.120> too<00:02:52.390> many<00:02:52.540> beads<00:02:52.840> or

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
don't want to use too many beads or

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.050 
don't want to use too many beads or
whatever<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.710> yeah<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> don't<00:02:54.640> know<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> think

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
whatever and yeah I don't know I think

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.190 
whatever and yeah I don't know I think
three<00:02:55.360> layers<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.960> good<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.470> yeah<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.800> yeah

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200

okay<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.260> after<00:03:06.099> you<00:03:08.459> make<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:10.030> layers<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
okay so after you make the layers and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.820 
okay so after you make the layers and
everything<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:13.330> time<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.680> actually

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
everything on this time you actually

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.150 
everything on this time you actually
make<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:16.020> bottom<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.709> fill<00:03:18.010> up

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
make the bottom of it and you fill up

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.089 
make the bottom of it and you fill up
you<00:03:18.670> fell<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.030> everything's<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:19.930> um<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.980> know

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
you fell in everything's so um you know

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.400 
you fell in everything's so um you know
it<00:03:21.250> should<00:03:21.489> look<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.870> if<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.290> guys

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
it should look like this and if you guys

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.050 
it should look like this and if you guys
wanted<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.830> copy<00:03:24.099> this<00:03:24.370> pattern<00:03:24.760> now<00:03:24.880> I'll<00:03:24.970> be

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
wanted to copy this pattern now I'll be

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:34.830 
wanted to copy this pattern now I'll be
stopping<00:03:25.239> here<00:03:25.540> right<00:03:25.720> now<00:03:29.580> okay<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:34.569> after

stopping here right now okay so so after
this<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.440> need<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.860> iron<00:03:36.069> everything

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.750 

okay<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.430> after<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.090> glue<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.350> together<00:03:43.760> it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
okay so after you glue it together it

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.850 
okay so after you glue it together it
should<00:03:45.000> look<00:03:45.090> something<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.350> as

should look something like this and as
you<00:03:46.890> can<00:03:47.070> tell<00:03:48.620> these<00:03:49.620> two<00:03:50.040> look<00:03:50.370> pretty<00:03:50.970> much

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
you can tell these two look pretty much

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.560 
you can tell these two look pretty much
alike

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570

on the just you know right here on the
layers<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.860> then<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.340> keep<00:04:26.490> stacking

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
layers and then you just keep stacking

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.270 
layers and then you just keep stacking

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
it and gluing it and yeah and then you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.000

just<00:04:29.460> press<00:04:29.580> down<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.420> oh<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:31.680> it's<00:04:31.860> all

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
just press down so it oh so it's all

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.900 
just press down so it oh so it's all
like<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.820> yeah<00:04:33.570> um<00:04:34.670> you<00:04:35.670> know<00:04:35.790> what

should look like that and it'll probably

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.580 
should look like that and it'll probably
take<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> couple<00:04:38.400> hours<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.910> dry<00:04:39.300> but<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.500> know
