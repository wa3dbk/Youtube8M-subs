00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
like the fact that they've included a

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.430 
like the fact that they've included a
four-cylinder<00:07:22.030> option<00:07:22.480> which<00:07:22.900> means<00:07:23.200> they've

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
four-cylinder option which means they've

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.130

that they've implemented a new 6-speed

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.970 
that they've implemented a new 6-speed
