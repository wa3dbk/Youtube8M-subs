just using some regular cotton yarn that
I<00:00:35.880> hadn't<00:00:36.239> laying<00:00:36.450> around<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> very

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
I hadn't laying around so this is a very

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
I hadn't laying around so this is a very
informal<00:00:44.040> pattern<00:00:44.430> she<00:00:44.730> doesn't<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.149> tell

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
informal pattern she doesn't really tell

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.639 
informal pattern she doesn't really tell
us<00:00:45.539> how<00:00:45.750> many<00:00:45.809> stitches<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:47.180> piece

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
us how many stitches to make our piece

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.299 
us how many stitches to make our piece
she<00:00:49.649> says<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> measure<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.910> shirt<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
she says just to measure a shirt and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.350 
she says just to measure a shirt and
make<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> length<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.239> your

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
make it the length of one of your

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.549 
make it the length of one of your
favorite<00:00:54.539> shirts<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.699> 86

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
favorite shirts so for me that was 86

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
favorite shirts so for me that was 86
stitches<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.770> 86<00:00:59.280> chains<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.719> you're

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
stitches or 86 chains and if you're

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.330 
stitches or 86 chains and if you're
finding<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.590> big<00:01:01.770> enough<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
finding that it's not big enough for you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
finding that it's not big enough for you
obviously<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.149> add<00:01:03.510> some<00:01:03.809> more<00:01:03.840> chains<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
obviously just add some more chains to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
obviously just add some more chains to
it<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.750> making<00:01:07.229> our

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it so we start with just making our

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.600 
it so we start with just making our
Slipknot<00:01:09.080> folding<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> over<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:13.610> pulling

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
Slipknot folding that over and pulling

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660 
Slipknot folding that over and pulling
up<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.850> loop<00:01:14.880> through<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> center<00:01:16.670> pulling

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
up a loop through the center pulling

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.270 
up a loop through the center pulling
down<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.420> ends<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.920> makes<00:01:20.130> our

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
down on the two ends and that makes our

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
down on the two ends and that makes our
adjustable<00:01:20.820> Slipknot

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
adjustable Slipknot

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.460 
adjustable Slipknot

this is going to go across the width of
your<00:01:43.530> shoulders<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.540> we're<00:01:45.660> going

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.930 
we're going into the second one here and
we're<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> single<00:01:54.780> crochet<00:01:55.940> this

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.800 
we're just going to single crochet this
entire<00:01:57.450> row<00:01:58.940> this<00:01:59.940> part<00:02:00.210> might<00:02:00.330> be<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.479> little

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
entire row this part might be a little

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.210 
entire row this part might be a little
tedious<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.320> you're<00:02:01.440> working<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.860> fine

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
tedious if you're working with a fine

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.070 
into this one right here next to it so
that's<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.580> entire<00:02:26.700> stitch<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
that's the entire stitch and this is the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.470 
that's the entire stitch and this is the
next<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.739> when<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.580> go<00:02:29.760> into<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.360> you're

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480

going to see that you're going to have
two<00:02:31.980> loops<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.390> top<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.769> single

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
two loops on the top and you just single

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.330 
two loops on the top and you just single
crochet<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> now<00:02:40.320> we<00:02:40.380> did<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.250> our

we're going to do it again we're going
to<00:04:36.660> have<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.840> total<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.140> two<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.470> we're<00:04:37.590> going<00:04:37.680> to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
to have a total of two so we're going to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.650 
to have a total of two so we're going to
pull<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.070> up<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:39.030> want<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.300> keep<00:04:39.450> these

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
pull it up and you want to keep these

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.270 
pull it up and you want to keep these
about<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.169> same<00:04:40.440> length<00:04:40.710> throughout<00:04:41.130> your

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
about the same length throughout your

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.320 
about the same length throughout your
entire<00:04:41.430> pattern<00:04:42.030> so<00:04:42.990> again<00:04:43.880> we're<00:04:44.880> wrapping

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
entire pattern so again we're wrapping

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.690 
entire pattern so again we're wrapping
our<00:04:45.479> yarn<00:04:45.780> around<00:04:46.020> our<00:04:46.290> hook<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.800> pulling

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
our yarn around our hook and pulling

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.719 
our yarn around our hook and pulling
through<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.270> loop<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:50.100> can<00:04:50.280> hold<00:04:50.490> it

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
through that loop and you can hold it

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.370 
through that loop and you can hold it
you<00:04:50.910> can<00:04:51.090> bend<00:04:51.390> it<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.960> can<00:04:52.140> see

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
you can bend it so that you can see

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.659 
you can bend it so that you can see
where<00:04:52.560> all<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.890> pieces<00:04:53.160> are<00:04:53.900> now<00:04:55.520> see<00:04:56.520> if<00:04:56.580> I

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
where all the pieces are now see if I

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.460 
where all the pieces are now see if I
get<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.880> little<00:04:57.090> bit<00:04:57.180> tighter<00:04:57.539> you<00:04:58.110> wanting<00:04:58.440> to

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
get a little bit tighter you wanting to

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.250 
get a little bit tighter you wanting to
go<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.950> this<00:04:59.190> side<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.930> you've<00:05:01.080> got

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
go on to this side so that you've got

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.100 
go on to this side so that you've got
two<00:05:01.560> loops<00:05:01.830> over<00:05:02.070> here<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:03.450> see<00:05:03.660> those<00:05:03.810> two

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
two loops over here and see those two
