00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.950 
fan of the game right but there's a
certain<00:01:41.729> point<00:01:41.880> where<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> defend<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
certain point where I have to defend a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.940 
certain point where I have to defend a
person<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> certain<00:01:44.070> amount<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.909> people<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
person or a certain amount of people and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.300 
person or a certain amount of people and
343<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.280> who<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> wanted<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> defend<00:01:48.180> because

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
343 is who I wanted to defend because

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.060 
343 is who I wanted to defend because
not<00:01:50.310> only<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.420> hashtag<00:01:51.930> hope<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.439> halo<00:01:52.770> but

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
not only is it hashtag hope for halo but

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.609 
not only is it hashtag hope for halo but
it's<00:01:53.189> also<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.909> middle<00:01:54.659> finger<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.229> face

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's also a middle finger to your face

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's also a middle finger to your face
343<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:57.060> AGL<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.600> picking<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.290> my

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
343 because AGL is picking up in my

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.190 
343 because AGL is picking up in my
opinion<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.430> happen<00:02:00.200> halo

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
opinion I think this will happen halo

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.709 
opinion I think this will happen halo
three<00:02:01.530> most<00:02:01.829> likely<00:02:01.979> maybe<00:02:02.880> by<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.210> end<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
three most likely maybe by the end of

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
three most likely maybe by the end of
this<00:02:03.840> commentary<00:02:04.320> maybe<00:02:04.619> even<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.920> couple<00:02:05.040> days

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
