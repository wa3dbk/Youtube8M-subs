00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.420
 yavuz people hello and sincerely 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.860
 welcome who would like a few extra 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.860
 dying off 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.070
 he was bad now but i wanted to 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.660
 just the small but fine 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 installation and show the four easter 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.560
 Eggs hidden on each card 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.390
 1 and I show you today on everyone 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.170
 card where the easter eggs and have here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.030
 we fock the first one on the map 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.970
 Hidden and we look at each other 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.010
 right then the second one and that is 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.770
 it then on baby you on the card 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.020
 along would have here in these four 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.020
 would have to lie down here and then you see 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.760
 then behind the shoot out and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 Do you already have the second of four? 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.200
 Ex found then if you want that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.989
 this whole challenge has come to an end 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.250
 you is there extra-points receives 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 In any case, the xp with if he 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 Gets a little tip from mine 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.940
 page who did not know it yes true 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.160
 just use the xp 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.899
 I think that can not hurt like that 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.789
 said on each card so the new one 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.580
 four cards is one of those eggs 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.640
 hides yes and here we see on the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.979
 next card on my current 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
 but somehow you also have it at the same time 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.640
 favorite card there should be this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
 ladder climb up so in the end 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.149
 first push the thing out if the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.679
 colleague then go to the side 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.840
 could i show you here now 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.840
 then you just go to the window 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 high and it could do it that way 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 you can now here from the left 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.099
 then you can see that directly 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.959
 already shoot 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.509
 the last one is on the k 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.539
 technical kabeg the end certainly yes 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.849
 all from mw2 scrap yes the replica have 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.039
 I also a bit something in the dlc video 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.599
 I think that's cool 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.130
 card but I do not know what I mean yet 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.840
 start with the spots on the map 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.959
 but they are a bit too 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.520
 So that's what I want 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.459
 but weird on the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 map is the most obvious 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.459
 To find this corner is me too 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.130
 first noticed 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.210
 and i am really happy i am me 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.670
 glad she did it 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.750
 not complete but normal to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.400
 Finally, always on such things because 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.590
 I'm shooting with the highest the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.780
 in that case it really was like that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 that luckily I leave most of them 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.600
 games with running and I have it here for 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 taken happiness because it really 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.050
 in the middle of the gameplay was you see I am 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.550
 start here on the right side and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.360
 thought so split up to this one 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.980
 shit out 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.110
 you look what happens he will 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.770
 then certainly one of these four 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.480
 gifted eggs coloring eggs are here 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.440
 that's actually relatively easy here 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.150
 sponsoring and I do not know where you are 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.380
 It has to be twice the knife I have with me 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.790
 I've seen another video 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.310
 that you have to jerk after two times better 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.780
 there are 2000 extra ep and I would 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.910
 Just tell you in the room 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.590
 if you did not know yet thumb 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.940
 upstairs if you knew write me 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.150
 a comment including from whom it 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.150
 seen
