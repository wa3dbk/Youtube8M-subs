00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.660
 poc this name sounds like a reference 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.780
 fire fighting equipment 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.289
 around the world implanted at the doors 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.260
 from Paris 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.850
 the pop group thinks we're testing and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.680
 distributes in more than 60 countries 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.210
 an ever- growing range of 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.000
 fight against the fire equipment 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.760
 created in 1976 by Mr. Grandpierre 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.309
 who by dint of passion for tenacity and 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.469
 tech did poke a reference 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.760
 synonymous with innovation competitiveness 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.170
 and performance 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.710
 his name is a story in the 19th 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.649
 century 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.960
 my great grandfather founded in France 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.170
 the national office of meteorology 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.289
 his knowledge of the climate led him to 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.039
 choose his case in Brittany to pass 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.199
 his holidays 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.760
 the fame of the brand poc builds 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.589
 on a know-how and a mastery of 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 several bodies of materials that range from 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.129
 CNC machining at 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.610
 the assembly of high precision in 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.650
 passing through lime loft that is 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.150
 why poc has established itself as 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 world reference through a range 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.790
 complete more than 4000 products for 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.430
 my tenth birthday 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.770
 my father offered me to sail while 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.280
 fishermen calligraphy the name of their 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.340
 boat to painting the yachtman 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.930
 use copper letters these 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.820
 copper letters are extremely 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.330
 expensive for a young boy without 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.330
 income and so look in my 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:45.040
 Breton dictionary have economic 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.020
 vigorous and sadar will find the name 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.760
 of poke the youth of a product of 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.350
 goals to design offices or a team 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.000
 of engineers here the biggest schools 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.010
 are working on software last 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.590
 hydraulic simulation generation and 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.520
 of fluid mechanics 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.479
 composed of a team of eight engineers 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.100
 technicians 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.050
 the design office allows the company 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.690
 poke to create up to two products 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.640
 new 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.010
 she always for the sake of innovation 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.820
 a department is specially dedicated 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.470
 motorized lans mastering 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.300
 technologies such as fiber optics 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.920
 the detection of hot spots where the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.150
 Night vision adapted on the vans 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.860
 this department is in research 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.480
 permanent solutions adapted to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.420
 customer requests at poc 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.360
 innovation is a being or mother assa 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.470
 case is one of the most hectic in the world 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.770
 there are swirling winds of 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.130
 indentations in the coast with swamps 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.140
 15 meters that provides currents 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.570
 that go up to 5 knots my ship 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.190
 with that name never poured ever 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.050
 sank when I created my company 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.480
 it seemed smart to give him 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.790
 this name brings luck the process of 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.590
 material manufacture poc des marsois 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.120
 crude castings either 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.120
 primary aluminum profiles 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 after wake the parts are routed 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.440
 at the machine shop composed of a park 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.180
 of more than twenty machine tools from 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.880
 latest technology allowing a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.470
 accuracy of the 100th a team more 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.780
 of thirty different realistic technicians 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.430
 operations thus giving rise to 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.640
 multiple parts making up a product 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.640
 poc 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.410
 our production unit has a 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 pack of 23 machines 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.560
 multi-axis digital cameras for 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.150
 latest technologies capable of 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.430
 perform machining operations of 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.950
 precision on noble metals a 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.300
 team of 30 qualified employees 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.880
 like them by following normal schedules 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.650
 post and realize the different 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.210
 operations to give 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.010
 birth to parts constituting a 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.990
 product proof every year more than 3000 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.190
 series changes are made 300 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.440
 tons of noble metals like 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.970
 the aluminum the bronze the Latvian and 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.460
 stainless steel are machined 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.590
 thus enabling the manufacture of 626 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.270
 the manufacturing process could aim 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.550
 permanently in order to respond to 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.500
 requirements and needs of our customers 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.600
 we also have a room 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.850
 metrology with different means of 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.590
 control to achieve 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.970
 measurements accurately on our various 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.519
 cooking pieces and a few words for 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.200
 to conclude poc a passion 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.730
 the poc production unit comprises 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.590
 also a boiler workshop 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.210
 which despite the growing technicality 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.130
 devices such as 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.840
 welding and robotic welding lathes 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.400
 mainly use 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.330
 know-how and the dexterity of 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.040
 the team of technicians 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.169
 once the different operations 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.910
 machining or boiler making 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.010
 next comes the assembly phase of the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.390
 material each piece is assembled 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.610
 unitarily by a team of 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.080
 technicians fitters and trained fitters 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.510
 specifically on each range of 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.640
 products in his proportional hand 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.110
 fitting lance monitor and that's 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.669
 clearly the commitment to the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.010
 quality of workmanship meets the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.350
 latest standards in force iso 9001 and 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.120
 iso 14001 a team of quality his 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.730
 constantly monitors the accuracy of 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.440
 measures and compliance with quality standards 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.810
 with a constant concern for quality and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.280
 performance 100% of the poc products are 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.450
 individually tested on a station 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.480
 of tests in real conditions 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.280
 of use the devices of 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.050
 foam production represents a very 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.610
 wide range of products at poc ranging 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.800
