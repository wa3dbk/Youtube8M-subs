00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.109 
that's something that's been mentioned
by<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> person<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> forums<00:01:53.490> but

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
by the person on the forums but

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.700 
by the person on the forums but
obviously<00:01:54.479> everyone<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.530> doing

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
obviously everyone is going to be doing

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
obviously everyone is going to be doing
up<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.040> standard<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.479> definitely

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
up a standard one so it's definitely

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.969 
up a standard one so it's definitely
going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> lose<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.290> lot<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> appeal

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
going to lose a lot of the appeal

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
going to lose a lot of the appeal
compared<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> my<00:01:59.969> current<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.450> which<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:00.960> does

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
compared to my current one which if does

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
compared to my current one which if does
that<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.920> true<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.460> definitely<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> big

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that to be true is definitely a big

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.350 
that to be true is definitely a big
shame<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:04.320> alternate<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.219> again<00:02:06.210> if

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
shame an alternate would be again if

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.510 
shame an alternate would be again if
that<00:02:06.390> does<00:02:06.689> turn<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.170> true<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.190> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that does turn out to be true is that I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.199 
that does turn out to be true is that I
could<00:02:08.729> carry<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.090> my<00:02:09.599> w/e<00:02:10.289> 13<00:02:10.830> version<00:02:11.209> along

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
could carry on my w/e 13 version along

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.260 
could carry on my w/e 13 version along
with<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.900> generic<00:02:13.050> 2k14

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
with a more generic 2k14

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.330 
with a more generic 2k14
as<00:02:14.360> well<00:02:14.540> which<00:02:14.690> would<00:02:15.320> obviously<00:02:15.410> involve<00:02:16.190> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
as well which would obviously involve a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.760 
as well which would obviously involve a
lot<00:02:16.550> less<00:02:16.730> effort<00:02:16.940> but<00:02:17.930> I'm<00:02:18.260> not<00:02:18.530> quite<00:02:18.680> sure

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
lot less effort but I'm not quite sure

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.010 
lot less effort but I'm not quite sure
people<00:02:19.310> will<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.150> willing<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> tune<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> see
