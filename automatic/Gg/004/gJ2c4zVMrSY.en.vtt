00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.299
When we last left them, Elsa, Anna, Luke and Han...

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.420
were heading off to save the ice palace
and rescue Kristoff.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.100
So, where are you from?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.740
I'm from Tatooine.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.300
I think I've heard of it. Is it on the other
side of the North Mountain?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.500
*Wampa growls*

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.940
What in the world is that?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.060
A wampa.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.260
A what-a?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.480
Blast it, Han!

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.740
I'll take care of it.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.760
*Wampa growls*

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.960
*Wampa whimpers*

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.260
There we go.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.939
Wow!

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.660
Nice shooting, Your Majesty.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.740
Thanks.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.660
Poor fella.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.040
I know a thing or two about being frozen.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.760
*wink*

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.260
This is too dangerous, and we're running out of time.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.300
We should split up.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.970
I agree. Han, you take Anna and look for the mountain man.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.040
Elsa and I will go to the palace.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.680
Sounds like a plan.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.260
*R2-D2 beeps*

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.510
Oh, stop your complaining, Artoo.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600
You don't even have cold sensors!

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.720
Oh my.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.860
Hi. What are you guys, robots?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460
*R2-D2 beeps*

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm not sure.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.649
He's some kind of unknown alien species indigenous to this planet.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.469
He has no internal organs. He appears to be made of...snow.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.560
It's okay. I'll wait.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.440
I am C-3PO...

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.840
human-cyborg relations protocol
droid.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.340
And this is my companion, R2-D2.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.400
*R2-D2 beeps*

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.440
This is the best day ever!

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.719
Why? Has the Rebel Alliance won a
major victory?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.680
No! It's because I met you.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.360
*R2-D2 beeps*

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.160
I love warm hugs.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.120
The odds of that happening are
approximately 7,413 to one.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.840
Oh, dear.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.540
You are strangely hard to resist.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.160
*R2-D2 beeps*

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.720
So where did you learn your power?

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.420
Oh, I've been able to do it since I was a kid.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.600
I'm training to be a Jedi myself.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.420
Master Yoda is teaching me the ways of the Force.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.100
Jedi? Master Yoda?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.600
You're making this
stuff up.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.330
So, your sister's a princess, huh?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.100
Yep.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.940
Mine too. Princesses are awesome.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.060
Um, so are queens.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.060
Luke...

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.980
Ben?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.720
What happened? Why are you so blue?

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.500
Your lady friend froze me.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.680
Did not.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.660
Did too.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.600
Did not.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.680
Did too.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.100
You can unfreeze yourself with the Force, right?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.920
I'm trying.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.740
Hey, do you want to build a snowman?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.200
It's forty below, lady. Why would I want to
build a snowman?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.940
You're right. What was I thinking?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.740
I guess because it's such good packing snow.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.560
But we're trying to save what's-his-name...

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.440
Kriston.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.500
Kristoff.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.840
I miss him so much...

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.540
*Flamingos squawk*

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.300
*Bear roars*

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.599
What's he like?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.320
He's kind of a loner...lives in the mountains...

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.360
rarely bathes...survives mostly on carrots.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.620
He sounds like a hobo.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.640
Are we risking our lives for a hobo?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.260
There he is!

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.300
Let me see your identification.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.480
See what happens next in Episode 3!
