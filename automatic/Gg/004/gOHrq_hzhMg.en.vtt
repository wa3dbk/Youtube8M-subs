00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
them somehow but other times you know it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.850 
them somehow but other times you know it
does<00:02:11.580> screw<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.940> over<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.810> mean<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
does screw you over so I mean it's the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.440 
does screw you over so I mean it's the
luck<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> draw

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
luck of the draw

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.540 
luck of the draw
and<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.010> can't<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.370> much<00:02:17.520> about

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
and you can that you can't do much about

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.930 
and you can that you can't do much about
that<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:18.480> there's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.230> right<00:02:19.349> there

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
that like there's a good one right there

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.910 
that like there's a good one right there
but<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.060> does<00:02:21.480> feel<00:02:21.510> good<00:02:22.170> when<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.680> kind<00:02:22.800> of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
but it does feel good when you kind of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920 
but it does feel good when you kind of
pull<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.730> crossers<00:02:24.330> across<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.750> screen

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pull that the crossers across the screen

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.809 
pull that the crossers across the screen
and<00:02:25.170> catch<00:02:25.349> somebody<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> head<00:02:26.790> um

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819
