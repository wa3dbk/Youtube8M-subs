00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hi everyone, seeing that in many me 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 you have asked for it or you have not 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.730
 said we also nice to the acronym vi 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:19.230
 I will explain how to make a type abbreviation 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:21.359
 this then you first wake up 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 very early in the morning devastated and done 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.460
 then in a suv a di leo gigante 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.820
 take live yogurt in the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.820
 fridge 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.250
 I recommend that you start because you know 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 the others are carcinogenic here and there 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 a lucullian breakfast after which without 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.600
 clear the breakfast because no 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 you will feel like being freed up in the middle of the table 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.510
 from crumbs and dirt we are therefore 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.850
 ready to prepare the Venetian material 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 paper scissors cardboard coffee cutters 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 especially the coffee guys ska and ci 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.340
 he also wants you to wake up 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 early in the morning 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 what do you want to do without coffee e 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 cut out the inscription joe jones you must 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 you can not be also for you giorgio 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.500
 the writing is really irreplaceable 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.500
 giorgios must be that and that's it 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.820
 well once cut out on the paper 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 printed you can transfer it to a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.460
 cardboard perhaps colored a bit 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.040
 so that you don't lose everything 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.770
 when they then cut out well 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.110
 scissors and you will have your writing 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.010
 ready at that point arm yourself with reflex 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.410
 easel and lights 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.870
 put yourself in another free space where 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.810
 you can spread the backing paper 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.420
 and apply over the writing that you 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.160
 they will all move in stop motion 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.620
 what is the stop motion the stop motion is 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.740
 a video technique which consists of 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.869
 move the various objects slowly 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 there are on stage and taking a shot at 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.270
 every move 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.430
 basically what you have to do is 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.020
 small shift small shot 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.360
 small shift shift movement 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.220
 small shot shift shot 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.340
 small displacement skinny break of 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.680
 balls in practice 9 I'm kidding you is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.780
 still nice fun like him there 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.000
 it is better to use diffused lights then 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.130
 maybe use parasols by 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.590
 those beautiful colored or colored 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.580
 our whites however just use one 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590
 diffused light 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.530
 so the light is pretty uniform 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.060
 unmasked and you will have no problems with 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.120
 any kind and then oh well if you want to do 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.540
 of the strange effects you want to experience 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.799
 also use powerful spot lights 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.239
 I don't put a beak though I had a 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.739
 remote controls that sell it for everyone 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.109
 reflexes possible by imagining 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.209
 definitely make a shot every time 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.280
 going to the room is a mess because 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.200
 take a quarter of an hour longer 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.489
 then also only the movement of the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.030
 click moves slightly the axis of the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.890
 room so maybe it's better if you want 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.810
 make stop motion to operate 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.909
 just this remote control that costs 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.040
 about ten euros I leave the link in 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.109
 description well the concept is more or 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.209
 minus this one thing I recommend if 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.019
 you want to make some initials in stop 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.139
 motion and starting from the last frame 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.419
 that is, from the position in which they must 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.879
 get the writing then you have 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.549
 well the written giorgios because it must 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.370
 be giorgioxt script arrange it well 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.500
 at the beginning and then do the movement at 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.019
 otherwise , you turn it starting from 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.450
 point of arrival and then you make it go to 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.889
 backward because it comes much easier 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.209
 much more precise 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.579
 well this is how much if you have doubts 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.079
 curiosity on how to deepen the 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.370
 question writes temelin a comment 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.260
 maybe I'll make another video 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.489
 otherwise I will simply answer you in 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.500
 comments 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.970
 with great pleasure we see you with a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 next video and I hope this is you 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.790
 interested though maybe in fact 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.889
 videomaker can interest you how 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.129
 these things work maybe left 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:12.129
 a like or comment that says hey don't 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.209
 I understood nothing but see you beautiful 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.209
 to a next video bye 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.270
 but beautiful
