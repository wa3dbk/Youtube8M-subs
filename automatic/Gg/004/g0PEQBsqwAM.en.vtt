experiences with that this will be I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.120 
experiences with that this will be I
think<00:00:20.189> level<00:00:20.520> 7<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.210> plants<00:00:22.109> vs<00:00:22.470> zombies<00:00:22.859> and

think level 7 of plants vs zombies and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.500 
think level 7 of plants vs zombies and
world<00:00:23.460> 1<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.689> reason<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.050> skipped<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:27.090> world

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

our<00:00:27.960> level<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.070> 4<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.519> 5<00:00:29.880> through<00:00:30.330> 6

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
our level I think like 4 or 5 through 6

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.639 
our level I think like 4 or 5 through 6
I<00:00:31.430> just<00:00:32.430> skip<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> 7<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.170> kind<00:00:34.530> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I just skip to 7 is because I kind of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.950 
I just skip to 7 is because I kind of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
flag with zombies in it that'd be

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.570 
flag with zombies in it that'd be
freaking<00:04:50.270> awesome<00:04:50.389> but<00:04:50.830> they<00:04:51.830> also<00:04:52.039> are

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
freaking awesome but they also are

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.210 
freaking awesome but they also are
talking<00:04:52.970> about<00:04:53.270> like<00:04:53.509> wager<00:04:53.870> match<00:04:54.229> combat

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
talking about like wager match combat

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.760 
talking about like wager match combat
training<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.000> think<00:04:56.349> theater<00:04:57.349> mode<00:04:57.530> with

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
training and I think theater mode with

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.120 
training and I think theater mode with
zombies<00:04:58.159> too<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:59.389> you<00:04:59.479> can<00:04:59.810> go<00:05:00.259> back<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.740> view

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
zombies too so you can go back and view

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.629 
zombies too so you can go back and view
your<00:05:01.190> zombies<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.780> theater<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:04.550> know

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
your zombies in the theater you know

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.800 
your zombies in the theater you know
they<00:05:04.789> might<00:05:04.970> have<00:05:05.120> gun<00:05:05.360> game<00:05:05.599> with<00:05:05.780> zombies

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
they might have gun game with zombies

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.159 
they might have gun game with zombies
that<00:05:06.349> be<00:05:06.500> free<00:05:06.740> that'd<00:05:07.039> be<00:05:07.190> pretty<00:05:07.370> crazy<00:05:08.169> two

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.420 
teams of four you know playing gun game
with<00:05:11.780> some<00:05:11.960> zombies<00:05:12.409> or<00:05:12.680> you'd<00:05:12.919> have<00:05:12.979> you<00:05:13.340> know
