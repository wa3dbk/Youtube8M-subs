stitch<00:00:47.290> all<00:00:47.950> you're<00:00:48.460> going<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.640> do<00:00:48.820> is<00:00:49.060> take

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
stitch all you're going to do is take

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.160 
stitch all you're going to do is take
your<00:00:50.020> right<00:00:50.260> needle<00:00:51.150> go<00:00:52.150> into<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.630> front<00:00:53.020> of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
your right needle go into the front of

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.530 
your right needle go into the front of
the<00:00:53.380> next<00:00:53.710> stitch<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:54.280> your<00:00:54.940> left<00:00:55.149> needle<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
the next stitch on your left needle and

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.000 
the next stitch on your left needle and
then<00:00:58.540> wrap<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.989> yarn<00:00:59.020> counterclockwise

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
then wrap the yarn counterclockwise

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.450 
then wrap the yarn counterclockwise
around<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.270> right<00:01:01.420> needle<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:05.130> then<00:01:06.130> slide

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
around the right needle and then slide

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.600 
around the right needle and then slide
that<00:01:06.640> stitch<00:01:06.939> off<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.299> left<00:01:07.689> needle

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.100 

so<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.480> through<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> front<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> stitch

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
so in through the front of the stitch

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
so in through the front of the stitch
wrap<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> yarn<00:01:16.380> counterclockwise<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:20.060> then

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
wrap the yarn counterclockwise and then

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:39.040 
wrap the yarn counterclockwise and then
off<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.600> left<00:01:21.840> needle

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.770 

so<00:01:39.590> it's<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.830> lot<00:01:40.040> slower<00:01:40.400> for<00:01:41.030> me<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.570> way

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
so it's a lot slower for me this way

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.660 
so it's a lot slower for me this way
than<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.800> continental<00:01:43.310> method

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
than it is in the continental method

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.440 
than it is in the continental method
that's<00:01:43.940> why<00:01:44.120> I<00:01:44.150> don't<00:01:44.590> really<00:01:45.910> knit<00:01:46.910> using<00:01:47.360> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's why I don't really knit using the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's why I don't really knit using the
English<00:01:47.750> method<00:01:48.140> very<00:01:48.350> often<00:01:48.910> but<00:01:49.910> it's

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
English method very often but it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.900 
English method very often but it's
always<00:01:50.330> good<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.600> know<00:01:51.310> how<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.370> do<00:01:52.640> things

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
always good to know how to do things

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.050 
always good to know how to do things
more<00:01:53.300> than<00:01:53.360> one<00:01:53.690> way<00:01:57.010> but<00:01:58.010> it's<00:01:58.280> not<00:01:58.340> hard<00:01:58.760> just

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
more than one way but it's not hard just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:33.350 
more than one way but it's not hard just
a<00:01:59.570> little<00:01:59.780> bit<00:01:59.900> different

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.150 

and<00:02:33.900> that's<00:02:34.110> it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
and that's it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.460 
and that's it
you<00:02:36.760> can<00:02:36.940> see<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.270> get<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> same<00:02:37.750> results<00:02:38.320> as

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
you can see you get the same results as

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.140 
you can see you get the same results as
you<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:38.860> with<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.280> continental<00:02:39.760> method<00:02:40.060> of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
you do with the continental method of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.120 
you do with the continental method of
knitting<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:41.050> just<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.470> different<00:02:41.800> way<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
knitting it's just a different way to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.610 
knitting it's just a different way to
get<00:02:42.370> there
