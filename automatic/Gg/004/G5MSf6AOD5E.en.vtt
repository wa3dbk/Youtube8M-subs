it that's the area we started looking at
there's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.620> lot<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:41.540> atmospheric<00:00:42.540> science<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
there's a lot of atmospheric science and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
was that the coldest temperatures are

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
was that the coldest temperatures are
actually<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> crest<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.450> crest

actually just off of the crest the crest
is<00:01:16.049> an<00:01:16.619> area<00:01:16.890> where<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> air<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.610> soon<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.909> it

is an area where the air as soon as it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
is an area where the air as soon as it
gets<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.450> low<00:01:18.630> temperature<00:01:18.659> starts<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
gets to a low temperature starts to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
gets to a low temperature starts to
drain<00:01:19.860> away<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.030> need<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> place

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
drain away what you need is a place

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
drain away what you need is a place
where<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.470> air<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.460> caught<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
where that air is actually caught and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.330 
where that air is actually caught and
held<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> while<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.100> cool

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
held for a while so that it can cool

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.690 
held for a while so that it can cool
down<00:01:26.369> still<00:01:27.060> more<00:01:27.470> by<00:01:28.470> radiating<00:01:29.100> away<00:01:29.220> into

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
down still more by radiating away into

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
down still more by radiating away into
space<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.170> those<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> places<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
space and those are the places that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
space and those are the places that
we're<00:01:33.060> finding<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:34.020> very<00:01:34.320> low

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
we're finding these very very low

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.310 
we're finding these very very low
temperatures<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.540> might<00:01:36.540> say<00:01:36.810> let's<00:01:37.049> go

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
temperatures you might say let's go

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.910 
temperatures you might say let's go
there<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> maybe<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.170> summer<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there and maybe in summer that's a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
there and maybe in summer that's a
reasonable<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.610> try<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.270> that's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
reasonable thing to try and do that's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.039 
reasonable thing to try and do that's
it's<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.590> cold<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.909> things<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.840> your

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it's really cold and so things like your

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
it's really cold and so things like your
ordinary<00:01:46.320> thermometers<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.490> mercury

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
thermometer won't work and alcohol
thermometer<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> lot<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.030> trouble

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
thermometer will have a lot of trouble

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
thermometer will have a lot of trouble
we're<00:01:52.229> talking<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.770> temperatures<00:01:53.399> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
we're talking about temperatures that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
we're talking about temperatures that
are<00:01:53.610> 50<00:01:54.000> degrees<00:01:54.299> colder<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:54.780> anything<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
are 50 degrees colder than anything that
