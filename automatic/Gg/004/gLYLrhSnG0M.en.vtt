00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.759
 in your room 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:16.340
 and that candle that consumes 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.540
 I diesel 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.550
 I am a medical singer artist 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.440
 all life flamenco and good after 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.850
 of my passage through the voice is trying 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.560
 I can take out a syndium that will create 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.890
 incredible that is called late to shut up 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.990
 the different sounds the base by 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.930
 course is flamenco is a person 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.470
 quite enterprising lent 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.560
 not without conformist and good thing 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.770
 always trying to climb one more step 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.230
 Thank you 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.390
 if it is where we find so firm 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.390
 and what agreement to each 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.829
 we hear the mystery canada destroy 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.470
 the illusion 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 also to shut up it came up well 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.689
 very unexpectedly this is a subject that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.229
 speaks of that feeling at the level of 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.229
 love 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.500
 an unattainable love that can not arise 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.660
 with circumstances of a life 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 and actually it was a mouthful to all those 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.550
 people in love 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.550
 now I do not forget 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.790
 be creative of your story that writes you 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.340
 my pretension with the single first thing 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.290
 reach the hearts of all one by 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.320
 what 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 considered that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.500
 to sing is to feel it and leave the soul 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.640
 and possible 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:08.860
 and I think that in that, all my 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.300
 singing intentions tried to enter 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 too much on paper and what I 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.360
 like to reach the hearts of all 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.360
 the people who listen to it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.660
 if it's with you 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.030
 and then at a professional level, of course 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.980
 that some record company likes to create 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 the idea is to launch it 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.080
 there is no 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.270
 it came without meaning 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.270
 wrapped up in love 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.480
 of each sample that I write to you 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.830
 I wanted to make a special mention to the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.770
 people who have collaborated on the single 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.750
 starting from the technical part and 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.000
 good also to the musicians of course 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.480

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.480

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.190

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.230
 deposited in me 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.380
 also especially to give I was coming is 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 the reducer of this theme 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.750

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.600

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.080

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.460

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.660
 result that we are all waiting for
