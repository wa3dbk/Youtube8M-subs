00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
my otterbox case the last two cases that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.490 
my otterbox case the last two cases that
I've<00:02:18.100> had<00:02:18.250> had<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.580> same<00:02:18.880> exact<00:02:19.330> problem<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I've had had the same exact problem the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.350 
I've had had the same exact problem the
first<00:02:20.530> case<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.280> had<00:02:21.430> replaced<00:02:21.730> within<00:02:21.940> 30<00:02:22.300> days

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
first case I had replaced within 30 days

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.220 
first case I had replaced within 30 days
at<00:02:22.750> best<00:02:22.990> buy<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.920> no<00:02:24.100> issues<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:25.210> just<00:02:26.110> took

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
at best buy with no issues I just took

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.480 
at best buy with no issues I just took
it<00:02:26.290> back<00:02:26.500> there<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.710> place<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.130> gave<00:02:27.250> me<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> whole

everything<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.450> issue<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.030> see

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
everything but that issue is if you see

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.050 
everything but that issue is if you see
these<00:02:34.360> tabs<00:02:34.720> here<00:02:35.340> these<00:02:36.340> tabs<00:02:37.590> these<00:02:38.590> tabs

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
these tabs here these tabs these tabs

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.990 
these tabs here these tabs these tabs
for<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.630> charging<00:02:41.470> port<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
for the the charging port and the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.780 
for the the charging port and the
microphone<00:02:43.000> jack<00:02:43.300> they<00:02:44.290> they're<00:02:45.130> really<00:02:45.430> thin

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
microphone jack they they're really thin

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
microphone jack they they're really thin
they're<00:02:46.120> cut<00:02:46.390> thin<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.050> don't<00:02:47.320> know<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.530> can

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
they're cut thin I don't know if you can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.860 
they're cut thin I don't know if you can
see<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.340> there<00:02:48.490> but<00:02:48.700> towards<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
see that in there but towards a the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.420 
see that in there but towards a the
inside<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> cut<00:02:50.680> their<00:02:50.890> cut<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.340> thin

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
inside of the cut their cut really thin

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.350 
inside of the cut their cut really thin
so<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.960> know<00:02:53.080> basically<00:02:53.290> they're<00:02:54.360> designed

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
so you know basically they're designed

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.490 
so you know basically they're designed
to<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.660> some<00:02:55.840> point<00:02:55.990> they're<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.260> fail

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
to have some point they're going to fail

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.250 
to have some point they're going to fail
and<00:02:56.800> as<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.670> can<00:02:57.790> see<00:02:57.820> on<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.270> one<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:59.020> came

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
and as you can see on this one it came

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.130 
and as you can see on this one it came
completely<00:02:59.650> off<00:03:00.450> where<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.540> tab<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.870> supposed

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
completely off where the tab is supposed

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.550 
completely off where the tab is supposed
to<00:03:02.230> be<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.770> came<00:03:03.130> completely<00:03:03.550> off<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:05.290> time<00:03:05.500> I

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
to be it came completely off this time I

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.420 
to be it came completely off this time I
did<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.800> little<00:03:05.860> bit<00:03:06.040> different<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.370> time

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
did a little bit different this time

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.150 
did a little bit different this time
when<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.530> actually<00:03:08.530> contacted<00:03:09.210> OtterBox<00:03:10.210> i

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
anything back you may however sometimes

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.140 
anything back you may however sometimes
have<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.250> give<00:03:33.370> them<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.550> code<00:03:33.850> that's<00:03:34.000> in

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
have to give them this code that's in

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.560 
have to give them this code that's in
there<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:35.200> little<00:03:35.470> code<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.670> don't<00:03:37.510> know

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
there the little code that I don't know

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.790 
there the little code that I don't know
exactly<00:03:37.840> what<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.020> coach<00:03:38.230> called<00:03:38.530> I'll<00:03:38.650> just

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
exactly what that coach called I'll just

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.890 
exactly what that coach called I'll just
call<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.100> date<00:03:39.370> code<00:03:39.580> because<00:03:40.000> typically<00:03:40.690> it

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
call it a date code because typically it

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.600 
call it a date code because typically it
correlates<00:03:41.860> with<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.070> date<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.490> was

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
correlates with the date that it was

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.280 
correlates with the date that it was
manufactured<00:03:43.330> when<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.720> was<00:03:43.810> manufactured

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
manufactured when it was manufactured

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.960 
manufactured when it was manufactured
and<00:03:44.620> sometimes<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.040> has<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> revision<00:03:45.640> date<00:03:45.790> on

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
and sometimes it has a revision date on

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.710 
and sometimes it has a revision date on
it<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:47.700> believe<00:03:48.700> these<00:03:48.910> two<00:03:49.150> revision<00:03:49.540> dates

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
it I believe these two revision dates

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.020 
it I believe these two revision dates
are<00:03:49.870> exactly<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.440> same<00:03:50.680> but<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.580> case<00:03:51.850> I've

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
are exactly the same but this case I've

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.640 
are exactly the same but this case I've
had<00:03:52.209> for<00:03:52.390> about<00:03:52.480> three<00:03:52.780> months<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.230> hasn't

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
had for about three months and it hasn't

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.800 
had for about three months and it hasn't
broken<00:03:53.890> yet<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:55.410> overall<00:03:56.410> i<00:03:56.709> give<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.340> case

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
broken yet so overall i give this case

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.740 
broken yet so overall i give this case
compared<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:59.670> the<00:04:00.670> older<00:04:01.000> one<00:04:01.180> i<00:04:01.530> give<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.560> a

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
compared to the older one i give it a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.020 
compared to the older one i give it a
probably<00:04:04.750> eight<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.080> half<00:04:05.110> out<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.380> ten

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
probably eight and a half out of ten

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.520 
probably eight and a half out of ten
compared<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.720> one<00:04:07.780> which<00:04:07.990> I<00:04:08.260> only<00:04:08.380> give
