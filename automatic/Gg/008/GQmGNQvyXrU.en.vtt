00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
keeping the lure from sliding down on

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.900 
keeping the lure from sliding down on
the<00:02:44.940> actual<00:02:45.420> hook<00:02:45.720> itself<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.799> now<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.730> we've

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the actual hook itself so now that we've

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.850 
the actual hook itself so now that we've
got<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.299> part<00:02:48.360> done<00:02:48.900> we're<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.769> go

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
got that part done we're going to go

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.949 
got that part done we're going to go
ahead<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.370> flare<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> little<00:02:51.810> bit

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
ahead and flare this out a little bit

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.259 
ahead and flare this out a little bit
now<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.280> do<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.489> with<00:02:53.670> your<00:02:53.820> fingers

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
now you can do this with your fingers

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.360 
now you can do this with your fingers
but<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> found<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.290> easiest<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.070> use<00:02:56.310> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
but what I found is easiest is to use a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.479 
but what I found is easiest is to use a
needle<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.600> know<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> pin<00:02:58.650> even<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.130> another

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
needle you know a pin even if another

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.150 
needle you know a pin even if another
fishhook<00:02:59.850> or<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.570> tip<00:03:00.720> your<00:03:00.930> knife<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.470> go

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
fishhook or the tip your knife just go

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.030 
fishhook or the tip your knife just go
ahead<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.670> start<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.660> unthreading<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
ahead and start kind of unthreading the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.339 
ahead and start kind of unthreading the
outer

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
outer

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.709 
outer
edge<00:03:06.469> of<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:06.859> paracord<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.670> actual<00:03:08.060> sheath

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
edge of this paracord the actual sheath

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.649 
edge of this paracord the actual sheath
of<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.379> paracord<00:03:09.890> may<00:03:10.849> be<00:03:10.909> down<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.180> quarter

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
of the paracord may be down a quarter

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.229 
of the paracord may be down a quarter
inch<00:03:11.870> or<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:13.040> little<00:03:13.340> bit<00:03:13.549> further<00:03:13.879> if<00:03:14.120> you

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
going to start working on the inner

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.679 
going to start working on the inner
strands<00:03:38.959> of<00:03:39.169> our<00:03:39.290> lure<00:03:39.530> here<00:03:40.389> we'll<00:03:41.389> take<00:03:41.629> the

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
strands of our lure here we'll take the

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.509 
strands of our lure here we'll take the
needle<00:03:42.409> point<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.919> this<00:03:43.069> is<00:03:43.219> where<00:03:43.400> this

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
needle point and this is where this

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.759 
needle point and this is where this
really<00:03:43.819> comes<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.239> handy<00:03:44.269> using<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.199> needle<00:03:45.409> or

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
really comes in handy using a needle or

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.830 
really comes in handy using a needle or
like<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.459> said<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:46.760> fish<00:03:47.030> hook<00:03:47.209> or<00:03:47.510> your<00:03:47.659> knife

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
like I said a fish hook or your knife

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110 
like I said a fish hook or your knife
and<00:03:48.139> we're<00:03:48.709> going<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.859> work<00:03:49.099> apart<00:03:49.609> these

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
and we're going to work apart these

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.080 
and we're going to work apart these
inner<00:03:50.840> fans<00:03:51.199> basically<00:03:52.090> unraveling

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
inner fans basically unraveling

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.300 
inner fans basically unraveling
unknotting<00:03:53.780> them<00:03:53.989> they're<00:03:54.260> kind<00:03:54.379> of<00:03:54.500> twisted

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
unknotting them they're kind of twisted

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.089 
unknotting them they're kind of twisted
so<00:03:55.669> we're<00:03:56.480> going<00:03:56.599> to<00:03:56.659> untwist<00:03:57.379> them<00:03:57.739> with<00:03:57.980> this

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
so we're going to untwist them with this

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.089 
so we're going to untwist them with this
method<00:03:58.519> here<00:03:58.810> now<00:03:59.810> go<00:03:59.989> ahead<00:04:00.199> and<00:04:00.469> do<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.859> on

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
method here now go ahead and do that on

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.490 
method here now go ahead and do that on
each<00:04:01.449> individual<00:04:02.449> strand<00:04:02.810> on<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:03.169> center

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
each individual strand on the center

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.640 
each individual strand on the center
core<00:04:07.389> okay<00:04:08.389> now<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.139> we<00:04:09.230> have<00:04:09.409> those

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
core okay now that we have those

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.309 
core okay now that we have those
relatively<00:04:10.430> untangled<00:04:11.299> there<00:04:11.509> we're<00:04:12.199> going

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
relatively untangled there we're going

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.369 
relatively untangled there we're going
to<00:04:12.379> go<00:04:12.439> ahead<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.739> set<00:04:12.949> our<00:04:12.979> pen<00:04:13.639> aside<00:04:13.970> and
