wielding<00:01:24.840> opponents<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.039> we<00:01:26.160> now<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
wielding opponents so we now know that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.430 
wielding opponents so we now know that
there<00:01:26.910> are<00:01:27.060> many<00:01:27.270> different<00:01:27.360> combat<00:01:28.110> forms

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and why so let's look at some of Lee's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.560 
and why so let's look at some of Lee's
starting<00:01:31.619> us<00:01:31.770> off<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.160> set<00:01:32.550> Audient<00:01:33.090> ed<00:01:33.270> form

would also strep ones concentration was

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.399 
would also strep ones concentration was
the<00:01:58.579> force<00:01:58.850> making<00:01:59.390> an<00:01:59.659> opponent<00:02:00.170> less

precise and effective
let's<00:02:02.960> turned<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.470> be<00:02:03.560> deadly<00:02:03.979> against

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
let's turned out to be deadly against

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.520 
let's turned out to be deadly against
Jedi<00:02:04.700> as<00:02:04.880> concentration<00:02:05.810> was<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.140> vital

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
Jedi as concentration was of vital

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.130 
Jedi as concentration was of vital
importance<00:02:06.680> when<00:02:07.429> using<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.030> force<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.050> as

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
importance when using the force so as

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.960 
importance when using the force so as
you<00:02:09.289> can<00:02:09.410> see<00:02:09.470> less<00:02:09.800> combat<00:02:09.830> form<00:02:10.489> used<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
you can see less combat form used the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.770 
you can see less combat form used the
force<00:02:11.269> as<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.720> form<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.349> psychological<00:02:12.860> warfare

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
force as a form of psychological warfare

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.630 
force as a form of psychological warfare
one<00:02:14.780> combat<00:02:15.230> form<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> dead<00:02:15.860> eyes<00:02:16.040> used<00:02:16.310> was

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
one combat form the dead eyes used was

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.670 
one combat form the dead eyes used was
so<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.660> was<00:02:17.840> developed<00:02:18.319> by<00:02:18.440> ancient

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
so can that was developed by ancient
