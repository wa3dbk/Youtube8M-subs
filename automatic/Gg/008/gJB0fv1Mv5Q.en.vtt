you<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.950> scaled<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.460> zero<00:00:35.840> then<00:00:36.840> hold<00:00:37.230> down

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you get scaled to zero then hold down

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
you get scaled to zero then hold down

control to loop select subdivide it a
couple<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.770> times<00:00:45.110> then<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.289> go<00:00:46.350> into<00:00:46.500> display

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
couple of times then you go into display

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
couple of times then you go into display
mode<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> turn<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:48.120> face<00:00:48.360> culling<00:00:48.390> so

mode and turn on back face culling so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.630 
mode and turn on back face culling so
you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:49.920> way<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> normals<00:00:50.550> are

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you can see which way the normals are

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
you can see which way the normals are
facing<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.140> press<00:00:52.350> ctrl<00:00:52.379> n<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.280> easily

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
facing you can press ctrl n to easily

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.180 
facing you can press ctrl n to easily
align<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.120> notes<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> same<00:00:54.840> direction

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
align all the notes the same direction

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.040 
align all the notes the same direction
then<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.520> W<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.480> flip<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
then if you had W you can flip the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.069 
then if you had W you can flip the
normals<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.730> always<00:00:59.730> like<00:01:00.000> using<00:01:00.210> cube<00:01:00.750> flip

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
normals I always like using cube flip

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
normals I always like using cube flip
the<00:01:01.230> novel<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.920> clicked<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the novel so I right clicked on it and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.500 
the novel so I right clicked on it and
selected<00:01:03.600> q<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> shortcut<00:01:04.619> key<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:08.510> usually

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
selected q as a shortcut key I usually

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.120 
selected q as a shortcut key I usually
exit<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> window<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.560> why<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> clicked<00:01:11.040> on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
exit that window that's why I clicked on

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
exit that window that's why I clicked on
it<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> add<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.170> particle

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
it then you want to add a particle

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
it then you want to add a particle
system<00:01:14.330> leave<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.540> starting<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:15.960> frame<00:01:16.080> one

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
system leave it at starting at frame one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.120 
system leave it at starting at frame one
and<00:01:16.409> ending<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.220> frame<00:01:17.700> three<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.009> put<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and ending at frame three and put the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.600 
and ending at frame three and put the
lifetime<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> 15<00:01:21.540> frames<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.520> just

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
lifetime up to 15 frames so it will just

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
lifetime up to 15 frames so it will just
spawn<00:01:24.000> all<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> dust<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.140> keep

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
spawn all the dust and then it will keep

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
spawn all the dust and then it will keep
floating<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> pretty<00:01:26.880> much<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.270> turn

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
floating then you pretty much just turn

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.600 
floating then you pretty much just turn
on<00:01:27.570> everything<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.200> random<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.650> possible<00:01:29.189> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
on everything is random as possible so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
on everything is random as possible so
you<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> put<00:01:30.000> randomness<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.750> everything

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you just put randomness and everything

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.800 
you just put randomness and everything
the<00:01:31.979> randomness<00:01:32.460> under<00:01:32.759> forces<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.420> actually

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the randomness under forces is actually

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080 
the randomness under forces is actually
just<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.140> force<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> maximum<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> two

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
just a force of two or a maximum of two

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
just a force of two or a maximum of two
in<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.420> random<00:01:36.720> direction<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> might

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
in any random direction so it might

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
in any random direction so it might
cancel<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.460> other<00:01:38.700> forces<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.360> add<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
cancel out other forces or add on to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.170 
cancel out other forces or add on to
them<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> keep<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.340> mind<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.759> also

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
them just to keep that in mind I also

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
them just to keep that in mind I also
use<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.869> dope<00:01:43.140> sheet<00:01:43.380> editor<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.460> lot

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
use the dope sheet editor it's a lot

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.810 
use the dope sheet editor it's a lot
easier<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.119> than<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.899> other<00:01:46.549> time<00:01:47.549> track

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
easier to use than the other time track

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.569 
easier to use than the other time track
you<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> turn<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.049> dampening<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you want to turn on dampening so the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.800 
you want to turn on dampening so the
dust<00:01:50.759> kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> goes<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:51.689> just

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
dust kind of goes up and then just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
dust kind of goes up and then just
settles<00:01:52.229> instead<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.369> flying<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.820> into

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
settles instead of just flying up into

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
settles instead of just flying up into
the<00:01:54.149> air<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.390> disappearing<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> doesn't

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the air and disappearing like it doesn't

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:04.860 
the air and disappearing like it doesn't
have<00:01:55.799> any<00:01:55.950> weight

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.660 

then<00:02:05.870> you<00:02:05.960> want<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> edit<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.500> material<00:02:07.100> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
then you want to edit the material to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.050 
then you want to edit the material to
brown<00:02:08.119> because<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:09.020> dirt<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:09.920> dust

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.430 

also<00:02:17.060> say

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
also say

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.950 
also say
to<00:02:17.560> about<00:02:17.740> 30<00:02:18.070> frames<00:02:18.280> since<00:02:18.820> each<00:02:19.570> particle

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
to about 30 frames since each particle

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.750 
to about 30 frames since each particle
in<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.380> last<00:02:20.620> 15<00:02:21.160> seconds<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.610> should

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
in the last 15 seconds you should

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.120 
in the last 15 seconds you should
probably<00:02:21.910> actually<00:02:22.450> about<00:02:22.720> 20<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.890> how

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
probably actually about 20 this is how

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.070 
probably actually about 20 this is how
you<00:02:24.190> set<00:02:24.430> up<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.700> record<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.150> video<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.510> set<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
you set up to record a video you set the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.150 
you set up to record a video you set the
save<00:02:26.800> location<00:02:27.310> then<00:02:27.610> avi<00:02:28.090> raw<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.890> can<00:02:33.010> also

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
save location then avi raw you can also

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.100 
save location then avi raw you can also
add<00:02:33.460> forces<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.240> move<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.630> dust

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
add forces to move the dust

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.990 
add forces to move the dust
I<00:02:35.140> added<00:02:35.650> wind<00:02:36.100> which<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.670> doesn't<00:02:36.820> really

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
I added wind which it doesn't really

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
I added wind which it doesn't really
matter<00:02:37.240> where<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.600> line<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.020> with<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.620> just

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
matter where you line it up with it just

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.170 
matter where you line it up with it just
matters<00:02:39.130> which<00:02:39.340> direction<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:39.880> going

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
matters which direction it's going

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.360 
matters which direction it's going
then<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.840> tore<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.410> force<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.830> about<00:02:42.010> 50

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
then I tore up the force to about 50

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.740 
then I tore up the force to about 50
just<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.790> can<00:02:42.910> see<00:02:43.120> exactly<00:02:43.270> what's<00:02:43.690> going

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
just so you can see exactly what's going

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
just so you can see exactly what's going
on<00:02:46.950> 5<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.190> actually<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.580> pretty<00:02:48.760> good<00:02:48.970> force<00:02:50.790> see

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
on 5 is actually a pretty good force see

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.640 
on 5 is actually a pretty good force see
it<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:52.000> kind<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.420> moves<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:52.900> there's<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.470> bit

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
it just kind of moves like there's a bit

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.810 
it just kind of moves like there's a bit
of<00:02:53.680> wind<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.310> not<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> lot<00:02:59.160> and<00:03:00.160> moving<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.670> back

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
of wind but not a lot and moving it back

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.940 
of wind but not a lot and moving it back
isn't<00:03:01.150> quite<00:03:01.270> necessary<00:03:01.420> press<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.560> number

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.559 

I<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:21.280> know<00:03:21.340> why<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.520> opened<00:03:21.700> display<00:03:22.239> just

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
I don't know why I opened display just

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.050 
I don't know why I opened display just
uncheck<00:03:23.280> emitter<00:03:24.280> under<00:03:25.030> render<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.880> that

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
uncheck emitter under render so that

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.750 
uncheck emitter under render so that
doesn't<00:03:28.360> show<00:03:28.590> then<00:03:29.590> add<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.069> plane<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.640> add

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
doesn't show then add in a plane and add

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.360 
doesn't show then add in a plane and add
texture<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.569> so<00:03:31.870> I'll<00:03:32.770> just<00:03:32.950> show<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.190> how

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
texture to it so I'll just show you how

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.960 
texture to it so I'll just show you how
to<00:03:33.430> add<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.610> texture<00:03:34.000> real<00:03:34.239> quick

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.360 

and

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.280 
and
adding<00:03:46.120> grass<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.659> this<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:46.959> doesn't<00:03:47.170> really

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
adding grass to this it doesn't really

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740 
adding grass to this it doesn't really
make<00:03:47.470> sense<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.830> since<00:03:48.040> it's<00:03:48.250> dust<00:03:48.640> but<00:03:49.390> that's

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
make sense it since it's dust but that's

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.899 
make sense it since it's dust but that's
what<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.959> did<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.220> don't<00:03:51.370> maybe<00:03:51.580> see<00:03:51.760> how<00:03:51.819> I

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
what I did and you don't maybe see how I

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.119 
what I did and you don't maybe see how I
go<00:03:52.480> through<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.780> menus<00:03:53.409> your<00:03:53.709> menus<00:03:54.010> are

and<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.800> might<00:04:00.920> press<00:04:01.130> n<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.280> open<00:04:01.640> up<00:04:01.730> that

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
turned out spectral so the press isn't

see a giant blob of dirt flying in the
air<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:17.690> want<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.049> turn<00:04:18.140> up<00:04:18.170> transparency

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.710 
air so you want to turn up transparency
you<00:04:19.070> can<00:04:19.220> leave<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.609> Z<00:04:19.850> transparency<00:04:20.570> as

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
you can leave it on Z transparency as

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.900 
you can leave it on Z transparency as
the<00:04:20.870> default<00:04:21.230> and<00:04:21.440> now<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.280> looks<00:04:22.460> like<00:04:22.520> dust

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
the default and now it looks like dust

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.300

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
decent framerate but this is just

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.050 
decent framerate but this is just
showing<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.380> how<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.530> add<00:04:34.070> collisions<00:04:34.910> with

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060

blender<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.050> you're<00:04:45.169> also<00:04:45.320> burning<00:04:45.980> up

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
blender and you're also burning up
