blade so she is here around at this
before<00:00:58.840> point<00:01:00.540> this<00:01:01.540> sounds<00:01:01.810> very<00:01:01.870> quick<00:01:02.470> and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
before point this sounds very quick and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
so if you're sitting you're going to go

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.890 
so if you're sitting you're going to go
full<00:01:08.170> pitch<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.670> shoots<00:01:10.150> up<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.780> being

a<00:01:10.990> quad<00:01:11.260> another<00:01:12.070> nqx<00:01:12.670> was<00:01:12.910> not<00:01:13.120> unit<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:15.100> it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
a quad another nqx was not unit for it

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.210 
a quad another nqx was not unit for it
with<00:01:15.660> it<00:01:16.660> was<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.870> lot<00:01:17.080> slower<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:23.440> thing<00:01:23.710> I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
with it was a lot slower this thing I

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.850 
with it was a lot slower this thing I
honestly<00:01:25.180> with<00:01:25.690> I'm<00:01:25.960> fighting<00:01:26.470> stability

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
honestly with I'm fighting stability

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.359
