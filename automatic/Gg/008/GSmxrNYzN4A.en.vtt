00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fairly easy to do this sometimes it's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.310 
fairly easy to do this sometimes it's
not<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.210> first<00:00:45.420> method<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.960> doing<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
not now this first method of doing it
it's<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.039> bigger<00:00:47.190> eyeshadows

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it's going to be for bigger eyeshadows

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.240 
it's going to be for bigger eyeshadows
like<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.149> next<00:00:48.450> ones<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.100> going

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
like my next ones so what you're going

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.770 
like my next ones so what you're going
to<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.000> take<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> piece<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.510> tape<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to to is just take a piece of tape like

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.650 
to to is just take a piece of tape like
this<00:00:52.489> fold<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> over<00:00:56.149> stick<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> back

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this fold it over stick it on the back

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.340 
this fold it over stick it on the back
of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.410> shadow<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.570> stick<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
of the shadow and you can just stick it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.189 
of the shadow and you can just stick it
in<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.960> looks<00:01:04.110> like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
in like so this is what it looks like

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.929 
in like so this is what it looks like
when<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> stick<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:04.890> tape<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.400> nice

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
when you stick it on with tape a nice

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
when you stick it on with tape a nice
thing<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.540> reusable<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:09.229> now<00:01:10.229> if

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
thing is this is reusable then now if

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
thing is this is reusable then now if
you're<00:01:10.770> dealing<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.250> smaller<00:01:12.060> shadows<00:01:12.630> like

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you're dealing with smaller shadows like

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
you're dealing with smaller shadows like
these<00:01:13.350> ones<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
these ones here from my these are the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
these ones here from my these are the
ones<00:01:16.229> from<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.409> la<00:01:16.799> color<00:01:17.070> palette<00:01:17.509> you're

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
ones from my la color palette you're

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
ones from my la color palette you're
going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> glue<00:01:19.560> method<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to want to use the glue method so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.370 
going to want to use the glue method so
first<00:01:21.000> method<00:01:21.780> you're<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> take

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
first method you're just going to take

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.899 
first method you're just going to take
regular<00:01:22.560> school<00:01:23.009> glue<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.580> you're<00:01:23.759> just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
regular school glue and you're just

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.990 
regular school glue and you're just
going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> squirt<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.380> line<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.799> glue<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.759> up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
going to squirt a line of glue going up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.240 
going to squirt a line of glue going up
the<00:01:27.150> total<00:01:27.570> length<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:29.040> place

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the total length of it and just place

00:01:29.250 --> 00:02:08.910 
the total length of it and just place
your<00:01:29.400> shadows<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.659> so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.710 

so<00:02:09.700> when<00:02:09.850> you're<00:02:10.000> done<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.420> should<00:02:10.450> look

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so when you're done it should look

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.570 
so when you're done it should look
something<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.319> my<00:02:11.740> glue<00:02:11.950> hasn't<00:02:12.220> dried

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
something like this my glue hasn't dried

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.460 
something like this my glue hasn't dried
yet<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.240> guys<00:02:13.360> get<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.690> idea<00:02:13.990> when<00:02:14.319> you

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
yet but you guys get the idea when you

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.230 
yet but you guys get the idea when you
are<00:02:15.100> doing<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.610> also<00:02:15.760> want<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.030> measure

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
are doing this you also want to measure

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.340 
are doing this you also want to measure
because<00:02:16.480> right<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.780> bottom<00:02:19.959> is

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
because right here on the bottom is

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.710 
because right here on the bottom is
where<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.340> there's<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.180> thing<00:02:22.480> here

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
where it's going there's this thing here

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.750 
where it's going there's this thing here
that's<00:02:22.959> going<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> hit<00:02:23.440> your<00:02:23.530> shadows<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.640> you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that's going to hit your shadows so you

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.860 
that's going to hit your shadows so you
want<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> make<00:02:25.060> sure<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.330> measure<00:02:25.630> that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
want to make sure you measure that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.720 
want to make sure you measure that
before<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.350> start<00:02:26.709> placing<00:02:26.980> them<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.520> in

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
before you start placing them all in

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.810 
before you start placing them all in
because<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.740> put<00:02:30.100> them<00:02:30.190> over<00:02:30.340> too<00:02:30.610> far

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
because if you put them over too far

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.250 
because if you put them over too far
then<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.390> going<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.690> hit<00:02:31.750> your<00:02:31.840> shadows<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
then it's going to hit your shadows and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.449 
then it's going to hit your shadows and
your<00:02:32.380> shadows<00:02:32.650> are<00:02:32.740> going<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:33.010> cracks<00:02:33.280> in

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
your shadows are going to have cracks in

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.670 
your shadows are going to have cracks in
them<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.050> good<00:02:35.290> thing<00:02:35.440> at<00:02:35.560> all

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
them and that's not a good thing at all
