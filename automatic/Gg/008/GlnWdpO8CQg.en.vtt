a jump into the slowdown difference

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.589 
a jump into the slowdown difference
because<00:03:43.950> something<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.760> basically<00:03:45.239> need<00:03:45.420> to

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
do the x factor at this point yeah call

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.509 
do the x factor at this point yeah call
her<00:03:47.760> down<00:03:47.910> yo<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.190> figured<00:03:50.459> he

so<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.700> thing<00:04:52.880> about<00:04:53.030> flying<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.570> floating

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
so the thing about flying and floating

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.960 
so the thing about flying and floating
is<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.590> if<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.920> don't<00:04:54.950> super<00:04:55.460> jump<00:04:55.670> into<00:04:55.820> the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
is that if you don't super jump into the

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.630 
is that if you don't super jump into the
fly<00:04:56.180> or<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.450> float<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:57.020> can<00:04:57.140> still<00:04:57.350> assist

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
fly or the float you can still assist

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.400 
fly or the float you can still assist
people<00:04:58.640> people<00:04:58.910> don't<00:04:59.150> realize<00:04:59.540> that<00:04:59.750> but<00:05:00.260> I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
people people don't realize that but I

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.590 
people people don't realize that but I
think<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:01.220> way<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.400> assists<00:05:02.090> works<00:05:02.300> in<00:05:02.510> this

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
think the way that assists works in this

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.510 
think the way that assists works in this
game<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.260> more<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.680> height<00:05:03.860> restrictions<00:05:04.430> in

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
game is more of a height restrictions in

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.610 
game is more of a height restrictions in
any<00:05:04.670> type<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:04.910> special<00:05:05.210> jumpers<00:05:05.720> no<00:05:06.020> no<00:05:06.080> if<00:05:06.500> you

any type of special jumpers no no if you

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.260 
any type of special jumpers no no if you

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
super jump and immediately float by off

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.930 
super jump and immediately float by off
the<00:05:08.360> ground<00:05:08.570> campuses<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.950> yeah<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.700> cannot
