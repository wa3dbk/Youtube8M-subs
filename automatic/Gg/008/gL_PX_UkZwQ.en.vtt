00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
programs of the market at the moment

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
programs of the market at the moment
doing<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.360> sort<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.020> thing<00:00:58.109> they've<00:00:58.440> been

been out too long I think it's quite a
new<00:01:30.299> new<00:01:31.170> program<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.900> we'll<00:01:33.900> give<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> bit

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
new new program so we'll give it a bit

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
new new program so we'll give it a bit
of<00:01:34.409> time<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.340> fare<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
of time to see how they fare in the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
of time to see how they fare in the
future<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.780> mean<00:01:36.960> they've<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.590> a

300 and I just want to see if he finds

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.199 
300 and I just want to see if he finds
this<00:02:40.390> driver<00:02:41.610> because<00:02:42.610> obviously<00:02:42.760> if<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
this driver because obviously if it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.570 
this driver because obviously if it
claims<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.690> scans<00:02:44.050> drivers<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.430> not

claims it scans drivers and this is not

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.670 
claims it scans drivers and this is not
unidentified<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.510> actually<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.260> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
unidentified this actually is that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.220 
unidentified this actually is that
identified<00:02:48.520> it's<00:02:48.790> already<00:02:49.090> says<00:02:49.360> Samsung<00:02:49.959> so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
identified it's already says Samsung so

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.340 
identified it's already says Samsung so
it<00:02:50.350> should<00:02:50.560> actually<00:02:50.770> find<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.370> driver<00:02:52.350> so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
it should actually find this driver so

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.350 
it should actually find this driver so
let's<00:02:53.590> give<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.950> scan<00:02:57.090> obviously<00:02:58.090> because

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
let's give it a scan obviously because

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.740 
let's give it a scan obviously because
it's<00:02:58.510> freeware<00:02:58.989> as<00:02:59.140> well<00:02:59.350> I<00:03:00.300> mean<00:03:01.300> if<00:03:01.600> you've

it's freeware as well I mean if you've

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.050 
it's freeware as well I mean if you've
got<00:03:01.780> loads<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.290> drivers<00:03:02.709> there<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.790> that's

scanning<00:03:52.810> software<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:54.400> not<00:03:54.549> just<00:03:54.610> this

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
scanning software so it's not just this

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.170 
scanning software so it's not just this
one<00:03:55.269> just<00:03:55.900> wondering<00:03:56.500> whether<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:57.180> why

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
one just wondering whether it's why

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.010 
one just wondering whether it's why
didn't<00:03:58.540> find

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
didn't find

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.220 
didn't find
anyway<00:03:59.770> so<00:04:00.640> that's<00:04:01.000> basically<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.660> program

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
anyway so that's basically the program

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.480 
anyway so that's basically the program
and<00:04:02.440> all<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.740> need<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.070> do<00:04:03.220> at<00:04:03.310> this<00:04:03.430> stage

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
and all you need to do at this stage

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.950 
and all you need to do at this stage
you'd<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:04.360> have<00:04:04.450> an<00:04:04.540> internet

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
you'd have to have an internet

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.540 
you'd have to have an internet
connection<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:05.590> work<00:04:05.620> work<00:04:06.280> with<00:04:06.460> this

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
connection to work work with this

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.950 
connection to work work with this
program<00:04:06.820> because<00:04:07.150> obviously<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.660> needs<00:04:07.810> a

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
program because obviously it needs a

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.530 
program because obviously it needs a
download<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:09.160> driver<00:04:09.640> seat<00:04:09.970> need<00:04:10.210> to<00:04:10.330> click
