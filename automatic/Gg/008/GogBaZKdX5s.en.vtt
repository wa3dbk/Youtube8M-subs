00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.929
 so in front of simon here it is friday 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.309
 we have knowledge and lifestyle and theme 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 today my opinion on the whole 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.850
 wemmer karl s uncle bob to this whole 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.420
 theme on the whole theme of the hater of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.599
 The wave of de-armament in the field 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 and today my opinion on this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 a very clear opinion that really for 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.730
 Furore will worry no nonsense 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.590
 Have fun friends why why me 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 now why am I so late why 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.649
 my opinion about it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 Maybe not for all the topic 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.670
 I do not want it again 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.559
 stay tuned on 10 anyway because it works 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.000
 actually all something on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.100
 even the theme is not so much 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.809
 Do I still know why or why? 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.829
 I was so late I wanted to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.840
 do not comment but i have now 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 determines the hundredth mail or the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.660
 Hundreds of questions got to simon 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.489
 do you stand by it? 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.869
 what do you say to the whole glk lamb? 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.350
 and anke bob and and what to say 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.650
 you too 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 there are certainly things that are not there 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.909
 run properly and I think it's very good 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.189
 if for example star tv or if 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 journalists or maybe even in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.210
 uncle bob because he is very strong with 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 the subject has dealt with there 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 I find an enlightenment video power 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.229
 very well 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.850
 I think it's good when enlightened today 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.110
 because he does not have many things like that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.960
 Run as they should 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 Of course I am not for the sake of God 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.689
 advocates of things that run there 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.950
 but i am not a professional first 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.079
 In the area I find it very interesting 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.990
 that suddenly a lot of adolescents 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.600
 many channels all their content 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 just build up and stay practical 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 to become experts though they are 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.390
 my opinion people have then tell 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.390
 suddenly something of medals multi 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.880
 level marketing and becoming adolescents 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.550
 also done with that and are suddenly 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390
 Specialists although they probably the most 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.220
 of it really no idea 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 have and only rattle after 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.909
 maybe somebody's part of it 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.990
 although she predicted people 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.729
 maybe not even know each other 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.100
 so did not bother and it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.940
 are whole channels that really only 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.709
 busy with others 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.190
 to tell something really 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.780
 hate to generate and really there 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.489
 leave out others and only about 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.190
 others to talk and all of us in the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.290
 Dirt and there are so many channels 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.170
 It is quite amusing to have a look 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.420
 but I think it's a pity if it is 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.590
 if just that misses the topic 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.820
 and that's why I really wanted to 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.290
 nothing to tell 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.060
 my theme is to show you as you do 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.400
 you develop yourselves what you to the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.320
 hand get around you can simply yes 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.120
 to develop further in sports but also 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 maybe mental and disciplined too 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 I want to show you that you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.239
 even in the hand and that creates 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.459
 you only if you look at yourself when 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.500
 you really look what can I do something 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.200
 Can I reach where I can go 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.820
 The whole thing will be very difficult if you 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.290
 the whole time just looks what others 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.160
 that's all in psychology 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.540
 typical maybe the reason 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.280
 why very rich people with more and more 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.799
 maybe more and more money always 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.120
 become unhappy because you are always with 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.280
 Maybe more people have to do that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.500
 have even more money and this up 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.090
 Comparison means that always look places 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.920
 had even more of the more 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.380
 and this upward comparison makes one 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.450
 even more unfortunate about it 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.670
 is my appeal to you? 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.709
 not always word stuffed like that 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.709
 definitely stuffed and then there are two 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.200
 hours of video and the resumee is yes 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.090
 probably has stuffed one 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.920
 please invest your time in 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.239
 broich does not look like what others have 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.430
 Look what you have shop where you 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.209
 maybe before wat and see where 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.709
 he wanted to go 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.670
 maybe also to the fitness channel 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.230
 maybe try again 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.709
 bit roots with their back to 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.079
 come 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.550
 There is such a good fitness channel that way 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.360
 have a lot of know how 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.410
 they probably know for 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.450
 you may be addressed 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.010
 also comment below who is there 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.740
 Pen used to have super good videos 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.030
 on the subject how do I get on like this 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.370
 my training schedule 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.570
 how can i develop and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.670
 they will eventually be 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.780
 stay and develop easily 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.790
 not further because it is only with 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.489
 others are busy evolving 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.900
 even further both the channel as 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.180
 Watching the people that the channel 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.860
 look at what you see 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.660
 could tear and that's why my comes 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.460
 conclusion so late that's why it comes 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.600
 anyway, because a lot of them somehow 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.180
 have asked questions 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.490
 I watch what you can do yourself heard 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.980
 Help somehow on it 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.560
 Doing something always stops everything 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.360
 questioning develops yourselves 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.060
 stay with you hope that he is the best 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.910
 I'll get out of ourselves 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.530
 continue to provide information for you 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.840
 I do not want to show you what you do not 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.020
 but what you could have that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.460
 means the channel is for you and you 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.140
 should just make the best of it 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.330
 you have yourself in the hand because of that 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.580
 Subscribe to the channel 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.140

 You need help very much there

 like to join in and stay that way
