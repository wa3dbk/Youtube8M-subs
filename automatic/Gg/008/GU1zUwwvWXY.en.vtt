00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:17.010
 kinetics fitness and bodybuilding 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:17.010
 lifestyle worldwide what's up today 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.419
 again responsible your questions 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.589
 here in the author's we are pretty late 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.289
 are now even at home but for 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.570
 to achieve this video and that is 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.640
 the discussion of whether you have a belt in the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.460
 training needs or not at which 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.530
 about him you need and for whom 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.449
 because a belt is not for him 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.620
 in general I get to this 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.840
 a lot of questions 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.780
 you see me in my videos too 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.870
 myself personally, I use the belt 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.940
 currently at the deadlift with heavy 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.910
 weight when squatting 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.980
 with heavy weight when transporting 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 and I as always a bit of a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.059
 Hate love have to find one kind 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.829
 I transport really well because you 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.809
 can build up really strong voltage 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.670
 I will come to the same but at 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.820
 Transport is there so that the load 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.680
 with easyjet pressure on the belly so big 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.030
 is that sometimes I have to be short 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.920
 I had just recently and transport 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.360
 training and also the fourth set 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.159
 I really have to almost throw up everything 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.770
 Just pressed on the stomach 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.390
 and otherwise yes the country has here 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.700
 I still need it there it is my name 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.929
 even that's all of them 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.240
 most important exercise for me at the moment 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.610
 gold coast it at the farm oars at 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.170
 heavy and sooner I have him one 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.970
 time long nor hard military in 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.649
 I do not use press at the moment 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.550
 heavy military prison therefore 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.590
 relevant 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.200
 that was it, I have already 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.830
 try to press the belt when pressing the bench 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.540
 use 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.770
 try at max force that has with me 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.430
 and again a little different 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.470
 made 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.140
 and why is in the goethe at all 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.220
 meaningful and why eat given too 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.960
 not more meaningful in the first place 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.240
 you have to know for what deadly 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.940
 many people think that a belt 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.210
 protects 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.490
 before injuries 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.170
 and that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.090
 may stand but not for 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.640
 all because what is very important to it 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.220
 know that we need to know first times 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.170
 you protect yourself without a belt all 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.720
 beginners already prepare with 60 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.010
 kilo thus 100 kilo in the sport already 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.200
 in the medium I use do this 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.910
 actually the people are wrong most of the time 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.190
 have not understood how to do that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.580
 abdominal wall how to get the autumn right 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.590
 controlled during an exercise or 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.420
 and right from that moment, you do one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.610
 also make sense if you look at the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.100
 heavy weights watt if you stay longer 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.360
 ever without good trained at this 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.920
 Mechanism has automated in mind 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.020
 I'm really talking about that here 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.980
 activation of the abdominal wall of the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.390
 abdominals 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.700
 during the exercises that is to say 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.390
 Example of sports when you are in the home 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.430
 is your style with inhaled really deep 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.150
 Extremely important in the abdomen 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.380
 fans doors 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.210
 I have that too for the lean back system 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.560
 calls in the video and I see that 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.030
 It always looks like it with me 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.030
 me from the moment I scoff at 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.710
 I'm right with my stomach 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.780
 bloated and then in the moment where you 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.370
 to be at the lowest point it is like that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.560
 important that here really the art 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.560
 tense and at the same time the air 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.970
 let out and then it makes sense 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.770
 if you can already do that 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.050
 to work with a belt because of this 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.790
 goethe's gives a thank you feedback 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.500
 and this feedback allows you 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.880
 even more so, but this pressure 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.070
 so that a goethe must make sense 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.650
 you also master this pressure 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.660
 first time the automotive 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.370
 automatism in the head have this value 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.710
 and then you have to have it too 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.840
 can still hold 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.310
 and before you could not that special 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.930
 also for example in the country 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.790
 I've been rowing for years 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.830
 done wrong and i would have absolutely 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.230
 nothing brought because I'm the constant 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.209
 could not generate tension at all 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.520
 on stomach because I like a 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.900
 Hohlkreuz was out of tension on the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.780
 torso has so I actually rather 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.650
 with the back of the back with the bottom 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.720
 back overstretched 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.670
 and so made a light hollow cross 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.860
 and at all a tension together on 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.720
 belly and there helps a well and exactly 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.760
 nothing is just subjective security 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.500
 and that's what you always get 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.480
 again in the forums if the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.069
 beginner for a belt ask there 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.329
 is again and again in goethes Although 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.010
 shit and shit is a google 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.199
 not at all people that is too 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.459
 I do not see the other view either 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.280
 partly there are people who simply 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.630
 claiming a lump sum and bringing a belt 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.020
 nothing trash is shit 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.090
 the people who then has again 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.740
 just that from one too extreme 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 Pages are in as soon as you just enter 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.389
 experienced athlete is or in the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
 powerlifting or astronomer then 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.830
 Most athletes use them when they are 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.050
 Do not just staple it 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.330
 belt and also when bank press people 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.430
 that's just the few kilos make up 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.530
 if you have feedback then this 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.490
 feedback the abdominal wall against this 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.190
 to push opponents 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.539
 Incidentally, I recommend one at the same time 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.099
 Always watch the belt 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.900
 every case takes a stable goethe 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.449
 the best thing in the world today 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.490
 Gets a caricature me and Patrick 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.539
 we have a bid in america you can 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.180
 unfortunately here in Germany nowhere 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.880
 Buy it being very very very good 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.650
 possibility gives on Amazon check times 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.810
 the link in the description 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.030
 the product recommendations are there for 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.250
 Example like coffee only 30 euro 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.090
 Elizabeth cost over 100 euros is not 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.300
 just cheap and yes it is called again 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.070
 combined belt makes sense if 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.889
 you are already experienced when you are 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.270
 already pushes decent weights and 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.570
 if you just this mechanism 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.970
 dominated belt does not make sense if 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.919
 beginner is when you are in general 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.330
 yet no heavy dishes that prove 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.669
 it does not make sense now at 60 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.740
 kilo during solicit been the move to 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.620
 I take scorte myself, for example 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.630
 up to 150 kilos complete without belt and 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.570
 I also do so to 160 kilo 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.860
 completely without a belt and of course 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.479
 Now again the definitional thing 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.389
 some find my service 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.630
 with 200 kilo or 180 already 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.580
 pretty weak what I can confirm 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.900
 for my bodyweight but for me 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.460
 It definitely needed if you know 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.520
 Yes, our effect is my personal one 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.650
 weak point my club not 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.840
 and yes that was it I think now 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.669
 I forget something yes in the recommendation 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.289
 Definitely such a belt with 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.509
 buckle so take or with 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.550
 this does not flap this normal 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.319
 Belts you pull on because they are huge 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.370
 mostly to do and then they are 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.750
 quite cheap actually 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.090
 now even every supplement 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.500
 manufacturer the people behind after due 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.830
 the 10 or 20 euros 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.659
 they are not really in my eyes 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.169
 I have a lot to use last time 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.280
 used in a big belt because of me 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.360
 I mean it had was 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.430
 I was really terrible 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.729
 not a good feeling at all 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.970
 Thing 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.539
 at the intel most popular ten and 13 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.979
 millimeter 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.280
 That means the idea is still a bit 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.840
 but it must be different and the 13 mm 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.090
 which we have now is really there 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.860
 and radek so that scratch on the border 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.389
 the certain as for example karl has 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.090
 I told him many already 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:00.069
 bit too hard and you get stuck 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.229
 So also you get in part too 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:07.990
 these had those bruises on their abdomen 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:10.750
 or the corset yes so I can directly 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.270
 more weight cards because it's just that 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.849
 Feedback is so strong that I can find it 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.319
 good if I also finds really cool like 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.659
 grepper kept rowing for me 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.580
 indispensable when scoring 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:23.949
 In any case, a lot of sure feeling when 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.729
 Dead listen because you can talk about it 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.440
 fight 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.759
 I think when I could read it 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.529
 theoretically still be
