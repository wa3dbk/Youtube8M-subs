00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:07.100
 cyberport presents the motorola razr 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.470
 For a long time nobody heard of motorola 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.720
 his smartphone saved yes from google 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.910
 was bought with the razer ai wants himself 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.320
 the troubled phone manufacturer back in 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.630
 the upper league fight 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.699
 if we can succeed, we'll see you soon 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.300
 but as always first the technical 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.640
 dates 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:30.439
 the motorola razr is 12 3 cm long 61 cm 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.649
 wide and 0 8 cm thick it weighs 126 grams 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.909
 and has a 4.3 inch display 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.100
 a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels in the 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.100
 racer works a single core processor 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.479
 with 2 ghz of the working memory amounts 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.639
 a gigabyte 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.699
 the smartphone is delivered with one 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:52.699
 fixed memory size of 8 gb however 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.379
 with a micro sd card up to 32 gb 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.850
 can be extended 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.760
 only 126 grams that would be just 14 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.559
 gram more than the iphone 5 that want 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.109
 we feel we are seeing 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.750
 in fact, the first impressions patter 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.549
 after the eeg hand just pick up like that 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.070
 one down the smartphone is 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.810
 actually a lightweight that lies 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.570
 especially on the frame from airplane 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.939
 aluminum is the back of the razr 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.219
 Kessler generally coats this 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.490
 phone really great in the hand 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.109
 There is a big praise from us 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.659
 which was one of the first impressions 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:32.060
 The visible part of the display goes 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.340
 unbelievably close to the edge of what one 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.719
 class image yield brings with it and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.149
 where we are currently at the display 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.520
 Brightness and color convince us 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.320
 Not quite the color saturation is something 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.780
 too much and can not be changed 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.640
 and the brightness is something too 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.560
 little that is necessary in sunny areas 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.829
 noticed 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.600
 doing here but there are currently only a well 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.549
 Motorola has one in the new razer 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.100
 intel atom processor installed 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.930
 Although he only has a core but creates 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.700
 with his two gigahertz nonetheless 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.079
 the power you get from today 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.820
 smartphone expected 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.759
 By the way, that was installed 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.929
 operating system android 4.0 and motorola 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.090
 has on his homepage already 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.430
 hinted that this device on the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.920
 Version 4.1 can be updated 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.800
 as soon as jelly bean is available 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.260
 thumbs up, but what about the 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.630
 camera was installed from an eight 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.700
 megapixel cam the videos in full hd 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.769
 takes and photos in a super 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.630
 quality shoots though many 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.790
 Settings options are 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.709
 some automatisms can not be changed 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.049
 so we interfered with the test shots 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.120
 little the automatic white balance of the 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.560
 not always correct were positive 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.870
 We would like to mention the feature of 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.030
 series shot with this is it 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.160
 possible in one second whole ten 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.750
 to take pictures of oneself 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.940
 then choose the best 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.090
 if that would not be with the white balance 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.040
 thus only a good one of us with the topic 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.519
 Acutely our mood then goes back to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.950
 above 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.900
 a battery with 2000 was installed 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.880
 milliamp performance that's the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.840
 Gets loose over a day 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.269
 make it usable 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.430
 for low use even two days 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.019
 Although you can not change the battery 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.359
 but that's already one of apple 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.340
 usual and also is so motorola 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.620
 that the housing splash-proof 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.880
 shows the subject of battery is so clear 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.190
 Thumbs up 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.620
 maybe two additional things 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.139
 which we say we find nice 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.690
 one is the device with the nfc chip 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.120
 equipped eg the pay with the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.920
 smartphone supports the other has 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.870
 you turn off the phone 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.730
 come up with a nice animation 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.460
 turning off an old one 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.290
 tube TV recalls 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.540
 but now not in the valuation a 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.890
 the whole conclusion can still be in 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.220
 to express a sentence 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.200
 Motorola is gone The razer can get up 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.090
 see every case and is with 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.230
 its comparatively cheap price 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.540
 on course for success 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.370
 we support this with four and a half 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.370
 of five of his stars
