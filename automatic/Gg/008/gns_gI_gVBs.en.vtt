00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.060

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.029
 May that was made to reveal the new 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.009
 xbox unfortunately here they were obtained 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.419
 several rumors and various things like 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.509
 names are originally going to be called 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.820
 xbox one and here is where the place 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.060
 where was unfortunately the short 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.340
 what happened to the people who supported this is 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.140
 a little weird but here comes bill gates and 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.220
 I'm a fan of bill gates and other 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.050
 weird things 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.780
 here are passing several people who have 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.200
 helped in xbox and in microsoft like 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.880
 windows in the following years in the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.280
 following and previous years that have 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.130
 followed some will know them and some 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.930
 no but I eat a little fanboy of 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.330
 microsoft well some if I know them the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.850
 most but not all how to see the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.579
 The first ones were some I do not know the truth 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.770
 I know them very well here in here 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.990
 how do you know this this character all 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.560
 many will know him because he presented the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.680
 the slim xbox and almost like other 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.600
 here you are remembering a little how 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 has evolved to xbox 360 to the xbox 1 and 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 how the years have gone and how has 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.289
 evolved the xbox live that then to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.170
 principle I had a few I think 30 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.890
 servers currently I think they have 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.149
 thousand or so or 15 thousand servers 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.039
 now they are going to have more than 300 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.509
 thousand servers from italy so you do not know 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.850
 you will be able to fall and there will be better 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.940
 connection the truth is fine but as 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.759
 they always know xbox charges for their 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.429
 subscriptions in your subscription that I'm going 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.340
 to how they see at the beginning of the minutes 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.450
 the first 1000 minutes at the first 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.520
 minutes of the conference they taught 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.349
 how was the xbox here and the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.209
 image and you can also make several 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.429
 kinds of things you'll be able to watch TV in 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.049
 I live from your local area or for the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.720
 from Mexico we will have the channel of the 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.450
 stars and at the same time you can see other 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.880
 things you can change the music you can 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.280
 watch a movie and at the same time you can be 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.700
 Chatting on Skype this is something very 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.209
 good 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.430
 as you see here is the how the form 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.640
 control the good thing about control is that already 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.200
 do not use batteries that already confirmed here 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.060
 netbook law as you see I was already 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.000
 saying of the servers as always 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.069
 xbox charges for its subscription for 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 that we play online know why 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.120
 because he has a better connection as you see 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.120
 the specifications I 'm going to 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.860
 read here I have it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.750
 here I am reading them on twitter from 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.819
 official and some of an application 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.190
 as they see they announced several games like 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.049
 the motor force to 5 to see if I'm 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.930
 pronouncing well I'm not seeing well 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:06.360
 the video also the bald ticos also 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.409
 they announced it and the graphics are also 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.110
 awesome because the kinect the 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.599
 truth came out much better than nothing and 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.140
 it has some better voice commands and 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.829
 has a better quality as long as you 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.829
 recognizes better 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.060
 and it's in case it's called and sport 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:32.360
 announced that they will have exclusives the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.190
 most like the same 14 the same 14 goes 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.069
 to have a great improvement and an engine 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.810
 graphic and this is another game that the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.360
 I was really impressed by a little girl 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.730
 that started and the boat and at the same time is a 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.400
 little weird that the net looks a bit 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.500
 great excuse for the quality of the video and 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.700
 how fast I do it but it's that I have 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.470
 things to do and well if something lie to me 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.720
 can put in the comment box 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.200
 odious to solve if you have any 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.590
 doubt 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.140
 something else is not going to require internet 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.330
 forever that was just a myth 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.640
 that is your clear console that if you need 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.090
 internet for an xbox live any 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.610
 thing this lady who is right now is 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.430
 director of the warner bros or something 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.620
 important that something is doing 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.030
 as a contract also here is this the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.070
 producer and director of 343 industries 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.770
 something else is going to be a series of 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.300
 television as I could tell you have 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.330
 won many awards 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.900
 the film halo forum turan and then 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.730
 how many fans liked the story 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.510
 and the plot that those had as the 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.940
 true 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.800
 many liked that and then the truth 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.310
 they are going to go with this and they are going to make a 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.010
 movie 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.810
 and steven spielberg is going to be the director 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.520
 that will help in this story to 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.440
 direct and then it will help in the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.300
 scripts the truth this is one of the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.820
 best film directors he has made 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.070
 and from movies good movies and series 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.380
 I really like them, even though they are 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.480
 a little silly and smoked and the truth is 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.140
 I really like this director, how do you see here? 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.720
 we are another thing that is going to be announced 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.200
 in this year in this late 2013 such 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.340
 Once you can announce this as you see the 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.920
 principle of a good here is saying 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.350
 that are going to be this here is the 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.990
 trailer in a short trailer call 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.930
 of duty boss I do not know the truth has not 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.090
 taught nothing of gameplay anything more 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:37.580
 kinematics of games and then we hope 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:42.970
 is that it's good and I hope you have 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.970
 a good stop rating as you see 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.120
 here is the official trailer of the new 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.530
 xbox wild as you see is a very very box 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.290
 girl have improved too many things like 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.770
 the color will be believe all 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:02.530
 things are going to be touch let's read them what 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.080
 what the cpu is going to have eight 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.930
 kernels 8 gb ram I think it's going to be 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.669
 ddr5 I do not know the truth, this is not what I'm not 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.800
 well reading well I'm reading it in 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.830
 a news any other thing its 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.740
 kinect wasser with a 1080p camera to 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.410
 30 frames per minute or 30 I think 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.110
 yes yes it's going to be a hd hd but not the 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.930
 Full HD but the truth is a good thing 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.940
 the control we are not going to batteries the truth 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.970
 It is very good because they did it a little 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.180
 more ergonomic to the previous one a little more 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.910
 light less heavy the truth a little 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.000
 more compact more elegant and the triggers 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.500
 they are a little more comfortable and something else is going 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.040
 to be silent you are going to have 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.310
 compatibility with windows windows phone 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.430
 and the truth those who have an android or 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.990
 something like you have a console 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.280
 that is, they want to buy me 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.540
 I recommend that you buy one of the 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.450
 Nokia Lumia because it's going to have 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:04.120
 compatibility as I continue to have a 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:07.480
 500gb disk I will have bluray wifi and 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.910
 an HDMI cable with the definition here 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.170
 you can also see you can chat in 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:16.930
 skype on skype and at the same time you can play and 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.630
 see a movie as you see is something very 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.210
 elegant presentation but it's good 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.770
 As you can see it's over, that's all I hope 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.070
 you liked it and then all the 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.970
 rights go to microsoft and then I 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.970
 bait dismissal
