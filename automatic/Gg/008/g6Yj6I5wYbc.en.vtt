the spoiler cage Bolin cage is a little

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.319 
the spoiler cage Bolin cage is a little
bit<00:05:32.719> too<00:05:33.409> big<00:05:33.679> but<00:05:34.069> that's<00:05:34.429> okay<00:05:34.909> for<00:05:34.969> them<00:05:35.269> to

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:35.329 
bit too big but that's okay for them to

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.059 
bit too big but that's okay for them to
get<00:05:35.509> a<00:05:35.569> feature<00:05:35.839> in<00:05:35.989> making<00:05:36.739> it<00:05:36.799> a<00:05:36.919> lot<00:05:37.009> more

get a feature in making it a lot more

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.359 
get a feature in making it a lot more
game<00:05:37.699> accurate<00:05:38.119> so<00:05:38.389> is<00:05:38.659> kind<00:05:39.439> of<00:05:39.619> okay<00:05:40.189> that

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:40.369 
game accurate so is kind of okay that

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:42.429 
game accurate so is kind of okay that
it's<00:05:40.489> actually<00:05:40.699> four<00:05:41.239> blocks<00:05:41.539> wide<00:05:41.839> here

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.439 
it's actually four blocks wide here

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.129 
it's actually four blocks wide here
rather<00:05:42.649> than<00:05:42.829> one<00:05:43.189> block<00:05:43.429> and<00:05:43.819> then<00:05:44.719> as<00:05:45.049> you

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
rather than one block and then as you

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.929 
rather than one block and then as you
can<00:05:45.169> see<00:05:45.409> we've<00:05:45.529> got<00:05:45.559> a<00:05:45.679> big<00:05:45.979> gap<00:05:46.339> in<00:05:46.519> the<00:05:46.669> floor

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
can see we've got a big gap in the floor

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.159 
can see we've got a big gap in the floor
there<00:05:47.179> which<00:05:47.419> doesn't<00:05:47.809> really<00:05:47.899> make<00:05:48.109> sense

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
there which doesn't really make sense

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.139 
there which doesn't really make sense
with<00:05:48.679> us<00:05:48.769> because<00:05:48.919> of<00:05:49.099> the<00:05:49.159> feature<00:05:49.399> which<00:05:50.119> is

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:50.149 
with us because of the feature which is

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:53.339 
with us because of the feature which is
kinda<00:05:50.719> to<00:05:50.929> act<00:05:51.709> as<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:52.459> zombies<00:05:52.849> are<00:05:52.879> spawning

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
kinda to act as the zombies are spawning

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.669 
kinda to act as the zombies are spawning
so<00:05:54.349> if<00:05:54.559> you<00:05:54.739> look<00:05:54.979> in<00:05:55.309> the<00:05:55.339> back<00:05:55.639> here<00:05:56.529> did<00:05:57.529> you

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:57.679 
so if you look in the back here did you

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:59.259 
so if you look in the back here did you
see<00:05:57.860> we've<00:05:57.979> got<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.189> zombie<00:05:58.459> there<00:05:58.639> you<00:05:59.149> just

00:05:59.259 --> 00:05:59.269 
see we've got the zombie there you just

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.939 
see we've got the zombie there you just
flip<00:05:59.569> that<00:05:59.719> up<00:05:59.899> and<00:06:00.049> then<00:06:00.439> till<00:06:00.649> somebody

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
flip that up and then till somebody

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.069 
flip that up and then till somebody
comes<00:06:01.099> in<00:06:01.369> max<00:06:01.699> oh<00:06:01.939> and<00:06:02.179> then<00:06:02.389> that<00:06:02.539> fills<00:06:02.869> in

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:03.079 
comes in max oh and then that fills in

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.379 
comes in max oh and then that fills in
the<00:06:03.110> floor<00:06:03.439> makes<00:06:03.799> it<00:06:03.949> look<00:06:04.099> a<00:06:04.129> lot<00:06:04.489> better<00:06:04.729> and

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
the floor makes it look a lot better and

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.569 
the floor makes it look a lot better and
then<00:06:06.169> dad<00:06:06.409> you'd<00:06:06.589> prefer<00:06:06.769> it<00:06:06.949> when<00:06:07.159> this<00:06:07.309> is

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:07.579 
then dad you'd prefer it when this is

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:10.929 
then dad you'd prefer it when this is
like<00:06:08.389> that<00:06:08.739> no<00:06:09.739> no<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:09.889> see<00:06:10.219> it<00:06:10.309> kind<00:06:10.610> of<00:06:10.729> fills

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
like that no no you see it kind of fills

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.679 
like that no no you see it kind of fills
in<00:06:11.149> the<00:06:11.269> wall<00:06:11.479> the<00:06:12.289> one<00:06:12.679> is<00:06:12.860> up<00:06:13.129> and<00:06:13.610> then<00:06:14.089> it

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:14.689 
in the wall the one is up and then it

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.629 
in the wall the one is up and then it

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
so then there be something exclusive to

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.439 
so then there be something exclusive to
this<00:06:48.409> sets<00:06:48.709> if<00:06:48.949> we<00:06:49.039> did<00:06:49.219> get<00:06:49.399> to<00:06:49.699> IM<00:06:49.939> pickaxes

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
this sets if we did get to IM pickaxes

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.929 
this sets if we did get to IM pickaxes
last<00:06:50.689> year<00:06:50.959> and<00:06:51.169> this<00:06:52.099> is<00:06:52.279> just<00:06:52.489> the<00:06:52.669> exact

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:52.939 
last year and this is just the exact

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.599 
last year and this is just the exact
same<00:06:53.119> steve<00:06:53.419> from<00:06:53.629> the<00:06:53.779> cave<00:06:54.019> no<00:06:54.649> armor<00:06:55.039> and<00:06:55.279> i

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:55.609 
same steve from the cave no armor and i

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:57.189 
same steve from the cave no armor and i
think<00:06:55.939> i<00:06:56.059> would<00:06:56.449> have<00:06:56.509> been<00:06:56.629> cool<00:06:56.899> for<00:06:56.929> them<00:06:57.109> to

think i would have been cool for them to

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.899 
think i would have been cool for them to
give<00:06:57.379> him<00:06:57.619> some<00:06:57.799> kind<00:06:58.099> of<00:06:58.159> gold<00:06:58.429> or<00:06:58.609> chain
