00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
gundam so let's take a closer look at

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.749 
gundam so let's take a closer look at
the<00:00:07.740> inner<00:00:07.859> frame<00:00:08.069> itself<00:00:10.370> as<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.610> see

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the inner frame itself as you can see

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.770 
the inner frame itself as you can see
here<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.809> view<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> pilot

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
here you can have a view of the pilot

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.660 
here you can have a view of the pilot
moving<00:00:15.780> down<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.920> say<00:00:17.070> put<00:00:17.279> some<00:00:17.460> armor

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
moving down you can say put some armor

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.210 
moving down you can say put some armor
pieces<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.630> legs<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.590> demonstrate<00:00:20.010> some

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
pieces on the legs to demonstrate some

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.490 
pieces on the legs to demonstrate some
of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> function<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> inner<00:00:21.150> frame<00:00:21.500> but

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of the function of the inner frame but

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
of the function of the inner frame but
as<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.100> there's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> credible<00:00:24.029> amount

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
as you can see there's a credible amount

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:40.780 
as you can see there's a credible amount
of<00:00:24.330> detail<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.279> this<00:00:26.279> inter<00:00:26.550> frame

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.250 

the<00:00:41.790> torso<00:00:42.390> area<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.810> one<00:00:42.990> of<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.140> most

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the torso area is one of the most

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.050 
the torso area is one of the most
interesting<00:00:43.710> parts<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> inner<00:00:44.460> frame<00:00:44.760> if

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
interesting parts of the inner frame if

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.720 
interesting parts of the inner frame if
we<00:00:45.480> turn<00:00:45.690> around<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.380> now<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.340> looking<00:00:47.490> at

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
we turn around here now we're looking at

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.810 
we turn around here now we're looking at
the<00:00:47.880> back<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.290> upper<00:00:49.410> torso<00:00:49.650> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.610> move

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the back of the upper torso if you move

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
the back of the upper torso if you move
the<00:00:51.000> arm<00:00:51.180> notice<00:00:51.810> these<00:00:52.050> parts<00:00:52.380> will<00:00:52.530> actually

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the arm notice these parts will actually

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.990 
the arm notice these parts will actually
move<00:00:53.240> as<00:00:54.240> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:55.880> which<00:00:56.880> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
move as you can see there which is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.390 
move as you can see there which is
really<00:00:57.240> cool<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.810> very<00:00:58.560> rewarding<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
really cool and it's very rewarding to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.340 
really cool and it's very rewarding to
put<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.700> together<00:00:59.880> and<00:01:00.330> to<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.020> how<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
put that together and to see how that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.110 
put that together and to see how that
works<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.460> definitely<00:01:02.760> worth<00:01:02.940> showing

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
works so it's definitely worth showing

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.510 
works so it's definitely worth showing
off<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:04.220> part<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> inner<00:01:05.670> frame<00:01:05.970> review

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
depending on how you want to position

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
depending on how you want to position
the<00:01:34.260> model<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.550> have<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.850> range<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the model so you have this range of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.600 
the model so you have this range of
motion<00:01:36.420> forward<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:37.130> well<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.280> range<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
motion forward as well as range of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.450 
motion forward as well as range of
motion<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> back<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:40.080> that<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
motion to the back like that as you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.920 
motion to the back like that as you
would<00:01:41.550> expect<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.970> most<00:01:42.210> Master<00:01:42.540> Grade<00:01:42.690> kits

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
would expect with most Master Grade kits

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.280 
would expect with most Master Grade kits
the<00:01:43.590> elbow<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> full<00:01:44.940> band

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
the elbow can actually do a full band

the elbow can actually do a full band
now<00:01:46.290> grant<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.980> without<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.310> armor

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
now grant it this is without the armor

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.640 
now grant it this is without the armor
on<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.120> should<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.300> able<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.290> pull<00:01:49.470> off<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
on but it should be able to pull off a

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.110 
on but it should be able to pull off a
similar<00:01:49.950> band<00:01:50.160> with<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> armor<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.940> and

the<00:02:15.870> hip<00:02:16.350> joints<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.860> be<00:02:16.950> locked<00:02:17.130> together<00:02:17.310> or

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the hip joints can be locked together or

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.940 
the hip joints can be locked together or
locked<00:02:18.540> spread<00:02:18.989> apart<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> i'll<00:02:19.739> show<00:02:19.769> you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
locked spread apart and i'll show you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.250 
locked spread apart and i'll show you
what<00:02:20.040> i<00:02:20.100> mean<00:02:20.160> by<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.430> right<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:22.110> can

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
what i mean by that right now you can

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.890 
what i mean by that right now you can
move<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.650> hips<00:02:22.800> out<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.489> bit<00:02:23.900> but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
move the hips out just a little bit but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.970 
move the hips out just a little bit but
what<00:02:25.080> you're<00:02:25.230> really<00:02:25.260> supposed<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.890> get

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
what you're really supposed to do to get

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800 
what you're really supposed to do to get
it<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.130> move<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.730> place<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.600> actually

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it to move out in place is actually

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.259 
it to move out in place is actually
there's<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.140> slider<00:02:28.470> here<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.910> crotch<00:02:30.150> area

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
there's a slider here on the crotch area

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.460 
there's a slider here on the crotch area
right<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.930> all<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.140> way<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
right now it's all the way to the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.430 
right now it's all the way to the
forward<00:02:31.769> position<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.549> i<00:02:32.730> move<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.440> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
forward position if i move that back to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.860 
forward position if i move that back to
the<00:02:34.680> back<00:02:35.010> position<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.019> lock<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.260> place

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the back position and lock it in place

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
the back position and lock it in place
now<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.930> hip<00:02:40.830> joints<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.400> spread<00:02:41.940> apart<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
now the hip joints are spread apart and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.210 
now the hip joints are spread apart and
they're<00:02:43.380> pretty<00:02:43.560> much<00:02:43.590> locked<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.100> that

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
they're pretty much locked in that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.610 
they're pretty much locked in that
position<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.299> see<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.230> if<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.440> move

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
position as you can see so if you move

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.190 
position as you can see so if you move
the<00:02:46.860> kid<00:02:47.130> around<00:02:47.540> you're<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> have

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the kid around you're not going to have

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.830 
the kid around you're not going to have
the<00:02:49.320> legs<00:02:49.500> flop<00:02:49.799> back<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.700> crotch<00:02:51.660> area

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the legs flop back into the crotch area

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.309 
the legs flop back into the crotch area
which<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.290> nice<00:02:52.470> i<00:02:52.769> think<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.160> allows<00:02:53.519> for

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
which is nice i think this allows for

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.429 
which is nice i think this allows for
more<00:02:54.739> dynamic<00:02:55.219> posing<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> really

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
more dynamic posing and it's a really

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.899 
more dynamic posing and it's a really
nice<00:02:57.620> feature<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:58.010> really<00:02:58.069> nice<00:02:58.310> mechanical

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
nice feature a really nice mechanical

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.300 
nice feature a really nice mechanical
feature<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.329> this<00:02:59.420> kit<00:02:59.659> and<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.799> could<00:03:01.010> leave

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
feature of this kit and you could leave

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.940 
feature of this kit and you could leave
the<00:03:01.519> slider<00:03:01.790> halfway<00:03:02.510> between<00:03:03.079> locked<00:03:03.709> and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
the slider halfway between locked and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.129 
the slider halfway between locked and
unlocked<00:03:04.040> or<00:03:04.549> halfway<00:03:05.420> between<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.840> front

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
unlocked or halfway between the front

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.410 
unlocked or halfway between the front
and<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.379> back<00:03:06.439> locked<00:03:06.889> positions<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and the back locked positions and the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.379 
and the back locked positions and the
legs<00:03:08.629> can<00:03:08.870> go<00:03:08.959> freely<00:03:09.319> in<00:03:09.439> and<00:03:09.560> out<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:09.680> that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
legs can go freely in and out like that

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.610 
legs can go freely in and out like that
but<00:03:11.389> like<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.629> said<00:03:11.689> before<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.200> lock<00:03:12.379> them<00:03:12.560> in

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
but like I said before to lock them in

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.959 
but like I said before to lock them in
place<00:03:12.650> either<00:03:12.950> all<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.280> way<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.639> forward

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
place either all the way to the forward

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.959 
place either all the way to the forward
or<00:03:14.120> all<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> way<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.139> back<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.790> now<00:03:16.909> to

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 
or all the way to the back so now to

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.119 
or all the way to the back so now to
move<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.569> hip<00:03:17.689> joints<00:03:18.049> themselves<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
move on to the hip joints themselves the

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.770 
move on to the hip joints themselves the
hip<00:03:19.310> joint<00:03:19.340> can<00:03:19.790> articulate<00:03:20.150> out<00:03:20.450> like<00:03:20.629> this

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
hip joint can articulate out like this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.270 
hip joint can articulate out like this
which<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.200> course<00:03:21.230> moves<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.739> leg<00:03:21.919> out<00:03:22.069> like

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
which of course moves the leg out like

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.459 
which of course moves the leg out like
that<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.700> this<00:03:23.569> piece<00:03:23.810> here<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.230> actually

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:24.469 
that and this piece here is actually

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.069 
that and this piece here is actually
made<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.189> hard<00:03:25.669> plastic<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:26.389> not<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.569> poly<00:03:26.810> cap

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
made of hard plastic it's not a poly cap

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.349 
made of hard plastic it's not a poly cap
it's<00:03:27.799> hard<00:03:28.099> plastic<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.790> think<00:03:28.849> that<00:03:29.030> lends

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
it's hard plastic so I think that lends

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.959 
it's hard plastic so I think that lends
some<00:03:29.719> strength<00:03:30.049> to<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:30.439> joint<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:30.969> won't

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
some strength to this joint and won't

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.030 
some strength to this joint and won't
wear<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.180> as<00:03:32.659> much<00:03:32.989> as<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.260> poly<00:03:33.530> cap<00:03:33.799> would

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
wear out as much as a poly cap would

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.199 
wear out as much as a poly cap would
over<00:03:34.909> time<00:03:34.939> and<00:03:36.069> here<00:03:37.069> is<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.400> look<00:03:37.579> at<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
over time and here is a look at the

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.929 
over time and here is a look at the
articulation<00:03:39.019> for<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.379> legs<00:03:39.680> now<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.430> left<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
articulation for the legs now I left the

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.179 
articulation for the legs now I left the
right<00:03:41.120> leg<00:03:41.329> here<00:03:41.629> bear<00:03:41.989> there's<00:03:42.560> no<00:03:42.739> armor<00:03:43.069> on

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
right leg here bear there's no armor on

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.770 
right leg here bear there's no armor on
it<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.549> that's<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.389> I<00:03:44.449> can<00:03:44.510> demonstrate

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it and that's so that I can demonstrate

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.869 
it and that's so that I can demonstrate
the<00:03:45.230> mechanics<00:03:45.859> of<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.159> inner<00:03:46.310> frame<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.790> how

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
the mechanics of the inner frame and how

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.879 
the mechanics of the inner frame and how
everything<00:03:47.180> moves<00:03:47.540> round<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.650> course<00:03:48.680> you

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
everything moves round and of course you

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.559 
everything moves round and of course you
don't<00:03:49.010> really<00:03:49.189> see<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:49.639> at<00:03:49.879> all<00:03:50.000> when<00:03:50.419> the

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
don't really see this at all when the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.300 
don't really see this at all when the
armor<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:50.870> completely<00:03:51.349> on<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.980> let's<00:03:52.129> take<00:03:52.280> a

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
armor is completely on so let's take a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.490 
armor is completely on so let's take a
look<00:03:52.549> first<00:03:53.510> focus<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.019> area<00:03:54.290> right<00:03:54.439> here

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
look first focus on this area right here

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.709 
look first focus on this area right here
this<00:03:55.099> is<00:03:55.159> really<00:03:55.489> neat<00:03:55.730> if<00:03:55.909> you<00:03:56.000> move<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.540> leg

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
this is really neat if you move the leg

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.199 
this is really neat if you move the leg
back<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.989> little<00:03:57.199> bit<00:03:57.759> you<00:03:58.759> can<00:03:58.849> see<00:03:58.909> how<00:03:59.180> that

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
back a little bit you can see how that

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.879 
back a little bit you can see how that
articulates<00:03:59.840> like<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:02.409> if<00:04:03.409> you<00:04:03.530> look<00:04:03.680> at<00:04:03.859> the

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
articulates like that if you look at the

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.439 
articulates like that if you look at the
knee<00:04:04.129> area<00:04:04.159> itself<00:04:04.699> you<00:04:04.879> bend<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.180> knee<00:04:07.449> you

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
knee area itself you bend the knee you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.159 
knee area itself you bend the knee you
have<00:04:08.629> this<00:04:08.780> piece<00:04:09.019> here<00:04:10.629> it<00:04:11.629> moves<00:04:11.840> back<00:04:11.989> and

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
have this piece here it moves back and

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.629 
have this piece here it moves back and
forth<00:04:14.650> alright<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:15.829> here's<00:04:16.039> a<00:04:16.099> look<00:04:16.250> at<00:04:16.459> the

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
forth alright so here's a look at the

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.399 
forth alright so here's a look at the
other<00:04:16.849> leg<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.509> left<00:04:17.720> leg<00:04:17.930> with<00:04:18.199> some

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
other leg this is the left leg with some

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.740 
other leg this is the left leg with some
are<00:04:18.530> run<00:04:18.739> its<00:04:18.889> focus<00:04:19.880> on<00:04:20.000> this<00:04:20.120> section<00:04:20.539> here

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
are run its focus on this section here

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.870 
are run its focus on this section here
as<00:04:20.900> I'd<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.859> leg<00:04:21.979> back<00:04:22.190> as<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.610> can<00:04:22.729> see

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
as I'd be in the leg back as you can see

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.719 
as I'd be in the leg back as you can see
they're<00:04:23.120> very<00:04:24.110> nice<00:04:24.380> very<00:04:24.889> cool<00:04:25.190> effect<00:04:25.520> with

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
they're very nice very cool effect with

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.689 
they're very nice very cool effect with
a<00:04:25.759> shifting<00:04:26.210> armor<00:04:26.479> it<00:04:27.440> shifts<00:04:27.949> as<00:04:28.099> you<00:04:28.400> bend

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
a shifting armor it shifts as you bend

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.409 
a shifting armor it shifts as you bend
the<00:04:29.659> leg<00:04:30.370> if<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.460> take<00:04:31.699> a<00:04:31.729> look<00:04:31.880> at<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.240> knee

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
the leg if you take a look at the knee

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.330 
the leg if you take a look at the knee
armor<00:04:32.750> here<00:04:32.960> I've<00:04:33.740> been<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.039> leg<00:04:34.159> a<00:04:34.190> little

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
armor here I've been the leg a little

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.390 
armor here I've been the leg a little
bit<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:35.210> actually<00:04:35.599> moves<00:04:35.720> back<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.199> forth

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
bit it actually moves back and forth

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.890 
bit it actually moves back and forth
these<00:04:37.400> are<00:04:37.550> actually<00:04:37.820> separate<00:04:38.300> pieces<00:04:38.570> that

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
these are actually separate pieces that

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.439 
these are actually separate pieces that
you<00:04:38.930> cut<00:04:39.110> off<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.349> tree<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.940> they<00:04:40.940> attach<00:04:41.240> at

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
you cut off the tree and they attach at

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.029 
you cut off the tree and they attach at
two<00:04:41.539> different<00:04:41.659> points<00:04:41.930> on<00:04:42.199> that<00:04:42.530> joint<00:04:42.800> over

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
two different points on that joint over

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.290 
two different points on that joint over
here<00:04:43.900> allowing<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.409> armor<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.919> shift<00:04:46.159> in<00:04:46.400> a

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
here allowing the armor to shift in a

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.830 
here allowing the armor to shift in a
very<00:04:47.509> cool<00:04:47.830> fashion<00:04:49.389> there<00:04:50.389> actually<00:04:50.509> is<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
very cool fashion there actually is a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.779 
very cool fashion there actually is a
piston<00:04:51.259> effect<00:04:51.560> these<00:04:52.250> are<00:04:52.400> actually<00:04:52.639> two

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
piston effect these are actually two

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.820 
piston effect these are actually two
different<00:04:52.820> pieces<00:04:53.330> here<00:04:53.750> one<00:04:54.409> that<00:04:54.680> covers

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
different pieces here one that covers

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.749 
different pieces here one that covers
the<00:04:55.310> smaller<00:04:55.669> piece<00:04:56.509> and<00:04:56.810> as<00:04:57.409> you<00:04:57.759> articulate

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
the smaller piece and as you articulate

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.129 
the smaller piece and as you articulate
the<00:04:58.909> ankle<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:01.070> get<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.280> very<00:05:01.460> nice<00:05:02.139> piston

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
the ankle you get a very nice piston

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.040 
the ankle you get a very nice piston
effect<00:05:03.440> ok<00:05:04.400> so<00:05:04.460> I<00:05:04.699> hope<00:05:04.940> these<00:05:05.150> reviews<00:05:05.599> of<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
effect ok so I hope these reviews of the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.810 
effect ok so I hope these reviews of the

before<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.650> was<00:05:15.740> kind<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:15.980> like<00:05:16.070> I<00:05:16.130> was<00:05:16.400> too<00:05:16.550> much

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
before I was kind of like I was too much

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.850 
before I was kind of like I was too much
time<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.480> like<00:05:17.990> building<00:05:18.290> high<00:05:18.440> grades<00:05:18.740> or

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
time and I like building high grades or

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.110 
time and I like building high grades or
whatever<00:05:19.070> but<00:05:19.190> I'm<00:05:19.310> really<00:05:19.460> starting<00:05:19.970> to<00:05:20.060> get

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
whatever but I'm really starting to get

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.400 
whatever but I'm really starting to get
back<00:05:20.300> into<00:05:20.510> building<00:05:20.900> master<00:05:21.230> grades

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
back into building master grades

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.470 
back into building master grades
especially<00:05:21.980> after<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.910> know<00:05:22.970> assembling

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.520 
these inner frames and reviewing them it
really<00:05:25.940> allows<00:05:26.660> me<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.990> appreciate<00:05:27.140> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.130 
inner frame and you know most the time
you<00:05:32.090> don't<00:05:32.180> really<00:05:32.330> see<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.840> inner<00:05:32.960> frame

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
you don't really see the inner frame

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.420 
you don't really see the inner frame
because<00:05:33.410> it's<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:33.890> to<00:05:33.950> be<00:05:34.040> covered<00:05:34.310> with

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
because it's going to be covered with

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.820 
because it's going to be covered with
all<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.760> armor<00:05:35.030> so<00:05:35.540> thanks<00:05:36.410> for<00:05:36.500> watching

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
all the armor so thanks for watching
