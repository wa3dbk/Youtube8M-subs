00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.750

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:23.820
 these foods they are easy 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.119
 preparation are fast also to prepare 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.220
 your salt date for periods 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.100
 where you can store this 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:39.160
 food and it will last a long time 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:46.469
 and these foods are a good first 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 that I'm going to talk is going to be about there me 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:58.030
 hear today known vulgarly good and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:01.660
 if you can do it in three minutes with 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:08.790
 400 ml of water, which is not enough and they 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.750
 sustain rather than be very 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.390
 long time 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.390
 in case the validity of this here 2015 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.939
 in case to make a journey so long 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.710
 a year there but they will last a long time. 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:38.259
 time I recommend you guys because they are 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:49.920
 I am also very satisfied with the 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:57.250
 two are the ones in the vono soup here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 there are others to get more into account is 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.969
 larger ones too 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.880
 in the case of these little ones here because I 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.280
 wanted to vary the flavors are many 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.020
 Flavors are difficult. 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.830
 the case of the quantity of flavors that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.290
 in the case the corn with chicken 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.690
 cassava had with an onion parsley 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.870
 potato with meat cheese with tomato 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:27.410
 basil with several different flavors 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.930
 different for you to like is Ã© 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:38.810
 also around 1 52 reais and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:45.940
 fill up to each one a portion and are 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:51.440
 also fast to prepare the drink 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:57.350
 I use sachet juices that are 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.080
 is already sweetened and I bought 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.060
 tank because the taste is almost identical 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.930
 of the fruit which is very good 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.240
 I recommend you not to drink pure water 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.630
 in the case of the camp you can take 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:17.650
 this noun that try to break your 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:21.110
 The branches there are very delicious and also 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.880
 carrying canned feijoada 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.739
 here is almost half a kilo of feijoada 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.690
 so I'm sure I will not 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:36.040
 starving in their first final 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.040
 week of food 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.250
 this beans here 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:48.050
 its expiration date is for let's see 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:55.130
 If you focus here I do not think you're going to focus 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:59.390
 focus is for three of the six 2017 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.070
 This one is the one that has more is more 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:08.000
 reality here of everyone 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:11.060
 I presented is it will last until 2017 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.830
 only the preservatives that he has to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.870
 make them last so long and make 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:23.889
 with which it increases greatly 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.360
 the sodium of this food will focus here 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.820
 I think not because the lyrics too 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:37.039
 small but in this feijoada that has 30% 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:40.370
 is very high but it is quite 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.530
 food is delicious you can eat raw 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.720
 that you can open the can here and 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.229
 just eat but in case I go 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.009
 put that whole can here in the na 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.500
 open fire in the holes in it here 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.590
 I exploded there too and I'm going 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:03.199
