00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.500
 hello to all friends and users of 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.360
 youtube how are you? 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.280
 this is the first sagas video of 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.410
 Myths that are in the San Andreas 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.540
 as a first myth I leave the ghost car 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.150
 as number one of myths in the san 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.610
 andreas well explained first that is the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.560
 ghost car ghost cars are 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.200
 vehicles destroyed but that continue 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.329
 working can be found in a way 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.510
 Occasional and in specific areas of San 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.370
 andreas the ghost client is one of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.180
 the two ghost car models of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.489
 San Andreas 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.500
 it's a slow shattered you see 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.750
 moving downhill from hill 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.420
 until it stops at some point and 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.710
 that never leads anyone inside 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.510
 have the glasses 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.290
 and rear and front bumpers 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.270
 broken this vehicle can be driven 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.640
 but it can not be modified in any 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.710
 garage or repair in the spray pn already 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 that when trying, it will always look the same 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.210
 this mental and irreparable bizarre 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.369
 aesthetically speaking it was done 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.500
 particularly famous for its descent 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.780
 from a hillside to a rock by boat 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.030
 beyond clean county what the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.830
 ghost nickname although what happens in 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.080
 reality is that when generated in a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.810
 pending without driver the vehicle will 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 precipitates downhill to tell the truth 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.039
 I've heard of this myth but I have not 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.899
 I started to investigate but I will today and 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.450
 They know that in the end if I see the myth 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.009
 I will put if it is true possible or false 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.009
 very good we go to the myth 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.060
 Well, I've already reached the place where 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.060
 there is the myth 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.459
 but what the hell is there already I saw it look 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.459
 that is the ghost car 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.960
 I will put the camera and zoom in 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.320
 so that they see it look at how shattered 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.320
 is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.530
 shit but what a car of the cojones 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.910
 but this is not all because I think that 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.910
 there must be another one here 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.660
 for this hill the other car must be 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.660
 ghost 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.810
 does not appear will be that here is not good 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.819
 I do not know if it will be around here but I think that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.980
 what I read the other appeared 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.690
 near the first one by this hill of 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.690
 I will continue looking for all of them 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.590
 I make the key of the jet paq to find 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.590
 the best 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.500
 shit look over there is the other car 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.510
 ghost 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.830
 look how it moves and there is no one in your 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.830
 interior driving what 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.189
 I will get closer to see it better 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.580
 everything is broken 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.040
 windows for frontal collisions 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.379
 rear bumpers 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.930
 the sides torn apart but what the fuck 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.909
 this car has shots the June yes 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.670
 others will have nothing to do with the 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.329
 killer of san andreas good I do not know but 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.329
 it's very weird 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 I do not know how the fuck this can happen 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.140
 well I'll go to the paint sprite to fix 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.730
 the car to see if it is fixed or it 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.730
 it remains the same xd xd xd 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.020
 looking for location of the cojones 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.409
 ok let's go 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.660
 well I'm already close to 30 spray there 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.350
 I'll go to see if it's true that 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.350
 it will not be fixed 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.150
 no good believe it the car change color 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.590
 but not appearance never got fixed 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.590
 look at it yourselves 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.610
 it's very weird this I'm very impressed 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.270
 with these results then it was true 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.270
 what they said 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.699
 I'm still impressed with the 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.709
 car results as you can see 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.439
 only change of color but it was not fixed 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:52.080
 and I thought it was just a cheap joke 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.179
 but it was not true we have arrived 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.389
 at the end of the video this myth I declare 

00:05:54.179 --> 00:06:00.569
 as true and true because what 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.489
 they said it was true xd xd xd good i hope 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.259
 that you liked the video comment 

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:06.449
