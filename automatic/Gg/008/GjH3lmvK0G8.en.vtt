Unity<00:00:14.730> game<00:00:14.759> engine<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.450> think<00:00:16.020> even<00:00:16.260> just

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
Unity game engine I think even just

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.920 
Unity game engine I think even just
typing<00:00:16.859> unity<00:00:17.340> should<00:00:18.119> bring<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.779> me

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
typing unity should bring it up for me

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.870 
typing unity should bring it up for me
unity3d<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.550> sure

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
unity3d will for sure

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.679 
unity3d will for sure
so<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> Unity<00:00:22.230> game<00:00:22.260> engine<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> top

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
so the Unity game engine is the top

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.300 
so the Unity game engine is the top
search<00:00:24.689> result<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.330> unity<00:00:27.330> 3d<00:00:27.599> comm

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
search result and it's at unity 3d comm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.919

export to the Windows platforms so I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
export to the Windows platforms so I
think<00:01:29.909> unity<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> good<00:01:31.140> game<00:01:31.320> engine<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.680> get

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
think unity is a good game engine to get

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
think unity is a good game engine to get
started<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> free

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
right back on the other side of the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.610 
right back on the other side of the
installation<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.750> start<00:03:15.080> unity<00:03:15.410> for<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
installation to start unity for the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.540 
installation to start unity for the
first<00:03:15.800> time

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.800 

so<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.640> installation<00:03:19.879> is<00:03:20.239> done<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.599> it's<00:03:20.720> a

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
so the installation is done and it's a

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.140 
so the installation is done and it's a
piece<00:03:21.019> of<00:03:21.170> cake<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.530> get<00:03:21.650> started<00:03:22.040> we<00:03:22.849> already

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
piece of cake to get started we already

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.000 
piece of cake to get started we already
have<00:03:23.299> run<00:03:23.569> unity<00:03:23.930> checked<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:24.650> I'll<00:03:24.769> click

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
have run unity checked so I'll click

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.360 
have run unity checked so I'll click
finish<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:27.019> Unity<00:03:27.349> game<00:03:27.590> engine<00:03:27.620> opens

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
finish and the Unity game engine opens

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.280 
finish and the Unity game engine opens
up<00:03:28.519> getting<00:03:29.390> ready<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.659> show<00:03:29.810> us<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.049> editor

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
up getting ready to show us the editor

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.010 
up getting ready to show us the editor
window

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.600 

so<00:03:38.020> when<00:03:38.170> unity<00:03:38.470> opens<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.160> see<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.520> you

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
so when unity opens you can see that you

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.780 
so when unity opens you can see that you
have<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.630> start-up<00:03:41.440> screen<00:03:41.800> that<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.130> can<00:03:42.160> get

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
rid of at any time but clearing this

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.600 
rid of at any time but clearing this
checkbox<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.680> these<00:03:44.800> are<00:03:44.980> some<00:03:45.130> great<00:03:45.310> links

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
checkbox but these are some great links

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.430 
checkbox but these are some great links
for<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.030> take<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.210> look<00:03:46.420> at<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.320> look

that project is called angry bots it's
just<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.170> quick<00:04:20.350> example<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.980> what<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.310> game

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
just a quick example of what the game

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.460 
just a quick example of what the game
engine<00:04:21.910> can<00:04:22.000> do<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:22.420> have<00:04:22.600> it<00:04:22.750> loaded<00:04:23.080> here

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
engine can do and I have it loaded here

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.920 
engine can do and I have it loaded here
if<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.520> do<00:04:24.730> install<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.330> example<00:04:25.750> project

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
if you do install the example project

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.870 
if you do install the example project
and<00:04:26.260> you're<00:04:26.350> looking<00:04:26.650> for<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.220> may<00:04:27.730> have<00:04:27.850> a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
little trouble finding especially on

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880 
little trouble finding especially on
Windows<00:04:29.800> 7<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.220> Windows<00:04:30.520> 8<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.500> trick<00:04:32.740> is

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
Windows 7 and Windows 8 so the trick is

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.640 
Windows 7 and Windows 8 so the trick is
when<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.310> open<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:34.330> unity<00:04:34.780> project<00:04:35.170> wizard<00:04:35.470> I

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
when you open the unity project wizard I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.920 
when you open the unity project wizard I
have<00:04:36.430> some<00:04:36.670> recently<00:04:37.060> open<00:04:37.330> projects<00:04:37.750> here

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
have some recently open projects here

over<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.380> robot<00:06:08.860> because<00:06:09.190> I<00:06:09.280> haven't<00:06:09.460> gone

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
over this robot because I haven't gone

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.420 
over this robot because I haven't gone
down<00:06:09.940> this<00:06:10.120> ramp<00:06:10.420> yet<00:06:14.070> leaves<00:06:15.070> a<00:06:15.160> little

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
down this ramp yet leaves a little

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.940 
down this ramp yet leaves a little
detail<00:06:16.180> mark<00:06:16.510> there<00:06:16.780> and<00:06:17.050> so<00:06:17.230> you<00:06:17.710> know<00:06:17.860> the

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
detail mark there and so you know the

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.680 
detail mark there and so you know the
engines<00:06:18.280> pretty<00:06:18.520> powerful<00:06:19.060> and<00:06:19.240> just<00:06:19.390> think

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
engines pretty powerful and just think

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.300 
engines pretty powerful and just think
that<00:06:19.870> we<00:06:20.020> can<00:06:20.200> export<00:06:20.560> these<00:06:20.740> kinds<00:06:21.100> of<00:06:21.160> games

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
that we can export these kinds of games

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.630 
that we can export these kinds of games
out<00:06:21.670> to<00:06:22.360> devices<00:06:23.350> and<00:06:23.800> then<00:06:24.040> try<00:06:24.220> to<00:06:24.280> get<00:06:24.460> them

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
out to devices and then try to get them

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.480 
out to devices and then try to get them
into<00:06:24.790> different<00:06:24.910> stores<00:06:25.390> so<00:06:26.340> what<00:06:27.340> we're

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
into different stores so what we're

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.950 
into different stores so what we're
gonna<00:06:27.550> do<00:06:27.820> for<00:06:28.000> now<00:06:30.270> which<00:06:31.270> you<00:06:31.300> could<00:06:31.570> do<00:06:31.720> and

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
gonna do for now which you could do and

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.840 
gonna do for now which you could do and
you<00:06:32.470> know<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.650> have<00:06:32.920> your<00:06:33.130> whole<00:06:33.280> environment

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
you know you have your whole environment
