00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 June I guess I'm not sure he had 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.150
 some problems due to some 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.550
 server updates 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.009
 work right and so only decided to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.420
 compensate that even the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790

 is training at last three days of this 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 very cool benefit so soft touch 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.100
 Congratulations, the second great news is that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 cip soft finally heard his 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 customers 11 cirque fulfill this product 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.610
 and it will rather create a server mode 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.150
 classic will be called retro pvp open 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.060
 what is the main purpose of this is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.740
 meet the people that wanted to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 a tibia of the ancient classical form but 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.299
 he suffers made it very clear what she 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.450
 What you bring now is a system and vp before 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.009
 a system by the ancient epi 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.229
 people complain a lot about the new 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.850
 pvp system she wants to give the option of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.579
 old pv system 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.610
 that is, it makes it very clear in some 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.989
 parts in the text here in this part 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.010
 here that issues outside pvp will not be 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.310
 altered as 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:23.430
 common mount is the unis is h is not going 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.349
 back to work by knight the few 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.569
 hands and not having urns is to sell the 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.720
 cnpc these things continue from the same view 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.989
 that what is going to have in these m than is well 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.299
 similar to the old servers 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.940
 an example something else that will confirm 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.879
 It's not even lucky, that's it. 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.280
 also not out thing that will continue 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.769
 have on this server that did not have 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.170
 formerly but which is a certain form of 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.819
 a little a little expensive there is a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.799
 middle ground or it's injustice mode start the 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.459
 to operate this system that is here 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.980
 on this little topic that they say 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.500
 following when you form a 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.290
 time pk is that there to p channel that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.629
 You 're going to do a few steps on the team. 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.819
 of five players falling p in a face 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.349
 no matter what i take it in relevant 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.709
 now in this new system 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.139
 you killed the guy the team lose killed 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.049
 face who leads to injustice 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.720
 the guy who offered that dealt the most damage 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.859
 that opponent and the guy who gave the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.709
 last hit or whatever leads me to believe 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:39.449
 that only 1 can take the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.739
 injustice or two for example what I 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.799
 I mean by that 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.199
 imagine that the guy who offered the most 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.540
 of an expensive pace was the same that gave the 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.269
 last hit which leads me to believe that it will 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.389
 there is only one judge there can not be until 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.370
 2 in justice at most will not have 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.530
 that thing that exists today that is a 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.709
 weak the fractionation of the unjust to 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.290
 Everyone who is in the team is beautiful 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.049
 same retro thing really cool 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.510
 this second topic here he is 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.729
 Speaking 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:18.269
 made love this second topic that 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:22.530
 bocker is talking about how to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.110
 Tell your paddle through. 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.900
 of players what they did not have before 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.479
 did not exist recently to 12 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.330
 years ago it will not have received or 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.520
 Are you on a team? 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.190
 to sin at someone your friends come and 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.680
 they treat that affection you 're going to 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.000
 face 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.520
 currently it is not possible because the guy 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.620
 that is outside the pvp the cars that 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.680
 would be out of pp not be 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.229
 influencing the mp or these guys 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 you could cross they said 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:59.639
 This is not going to happen the old way. 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:09.479
 cool classic even third point 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:11.729
 It is the system they talk about that is the 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.840
 struggle that this system of struggle 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.449
 just right 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.960
 for example ten faces takes 300 of the 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:22.199
 sin a level 10 guy in a fight 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.510
 just in the current system this guy does not 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.340
 lose nothing does not go blair does not lose 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.650
 nothing participates does not lose anything because 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.930
 because the fight is so absolutely 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.590
 unfair that he does not lose anything 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.970
 only on this server or it will not 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.880
 there is mann 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.680
 it does not matter if it's transits you 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.070
 will lose 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.780
 We hope you lose the guy, nothing, everything. 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.229
 There is no fair fight 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.729
 fourth and last point them 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:59.030
 made it clear that you will have to 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:03.289
 to serve the blair 7 east system which 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.479
 until then has such a blessing of pvp 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:09.180
 when you die just for 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:13.500
 impeccable peccati a guy gives you a piti 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.630
 kill you only pay to bless pvp not 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.630
 it is 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.409
 on this server you lose all the glass 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.960
 sets and had bought them again 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:27.000
 classic too retro good i liked it 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.310
 Finally for me, it's two great news. 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.020
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.389
 video for me was very wonderful 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.029
 pass this information to you I 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.950
 I'm going to stay here, thank you all, if 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.470
 Do you have that brother that was? 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.260
 needing to play a server 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.300
 tom and wanted these did not want these 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.850
 Settings share this video to 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.320
