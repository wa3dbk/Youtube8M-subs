00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.780
 or the people are the clumsy gamer I would 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.459
 I bring a new skype video this time 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 is going to be a tutorial on the gems of 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.890
 soul well and what are the gems for? 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 of the soul 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 Well for us to serve 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
 put spells on weapons like 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.820
 this for example I have the bow of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.009
 trico is delighted with what will burn 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.079
 to the goal making him lose 21 21 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.460
 points and goals burning because you 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.919
 says that they receive additional damage by 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.629
 the fire also because this as we 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.910
 we go using the bar that we see 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.739
 below as we see it is empty so 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 we're going to have to recharge it for 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 reload what we have to do is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.320
 give in this case in the xbox then 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.090
 to r &amp; b and select a gem of the soul 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.430
 with which to recharge it depending on the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 of the quality of the soul gem that what 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.489
 we will see now in a moment then it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.220
 will reload more or less for example 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.329
 top is recharged almost completely and 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.000
 the truth that is something incredibly 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.070
 unnecessary use if you want to go after 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.510
 pretty good in skyrim but not only 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.800
 it is used to enchant weapons but 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.170
 it also helps us to love us 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.790
 outfits like the helmet the gloves the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.500
 absolutely everything you can 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.909
 love and the truth that it shows 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 very much the difference to go with all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.540
 delighted to go without anything delighted is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.249
 abysmal the difference that you notice 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.780
 gems we are going to find it 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:16.140
 long of the world such that thus put 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.570
 on 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.120
 about places and especially where they are 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 wizards or witches crows let's find 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.540
 a lot of gems of this style several 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 types of soul gems now I'm going to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.050
 explain and I'll name them as minor 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.400
 quality higher quality anyway 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.780
 depending on the price we see 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.970
 we who have the gems of the soul 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 we can already see what is better or worse 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.540
 you also have to notice if they have something 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.009
 written in parentheses for example 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.590
 here we have great gem of the soul 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.270
 insignificant and in parentheses has 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.220
 so insignificant is to say this is a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 great gem of the soul but we have loaded it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.500
 with one with such an insignificant soul 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.180
 that has been a waste but good and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 if you do not have anything in parentheses it is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 that are empty how are you from here well 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.759
 and now we are going to see the gems 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.259
 all there are according to their 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.539
 quality of the least is the most 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.280
 shabby to the best there is the least of 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.570
 all is the most beautiful is the gem of the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 insignificant soul that we see that has 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.320
 of value 10 the psyche close up the gems 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 of the lower soul that has value 25 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 then come the gem of the common soul that 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.530
 has a value of 50 or higher that is worth 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.750
 100 and finally the great gem of the soul 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.850
 that is worth 200 then we have another one that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 called gem of the black soul that is worth 300 and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.450
 that is a pass but that I recommend 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.940
 save especially for when 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.739
 you want to take away vampirism well 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.090
 now for that exactly that 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.489
 that is to say 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.980
 insignificant as a large normal 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.930
 good because because depending on the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 soul that you want to capture by 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.190
 example if you want to capture the soul of 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.080
 a giant or the soul of a bear 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.970
 you can use the same type of gem 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.590
 depending on the quality so 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.720
 say it from the strength of the soul that you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.549
 you want to catch that gem in a gem 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.810
 it will have to be of one size or another if 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.370
 for example you kill a person 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.590
 wearing a gem of the soul 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.959
 insignificant when you have stretched the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 spell of soul or you have given it with the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.530
 Enchanted weapon is going to tell you that in the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.819
 soul could not be caught because no 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.739
 you have a gem enough 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.090
 big and that's why we have to be 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.440
 Attentive to always wear gems of the soul 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.660
 that correspond with the soul that 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.950
 we want us to catch apart 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.019
 say that the soul gems more 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.880
 powerful women who have more powerful souls 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.099
 they will give us much more spells 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.840
 powerful for example enchantments that 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.190
 I for example, I'm going to love this 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.640
 crossbow and I'll love it with 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.830
 absorb endurance for example 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.959
 let's see here the difference of whether a 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.270
 singing is crossbow with a soul gem 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.620
 or with another without charm simply with 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.360
 a call to the higher soul as 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.240
 we can see then it's going to cost us 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.709
 to be worth 568 and will absorb 20 points of 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.690
 endure what happens here if we the 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.720
 we sing with a great gem of the soul is going to 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.400
 worth 688 and that is going to mean a 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.510
 great improvement we must also say that 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.220
 depending on the quality of our 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.840
 spells and enchantments as it is supposed 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.160
 that will go up faster anyway 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.380
 I recommend raising the skills 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.520
 enchantment of challenges that do not become 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.200
 crazy but just upload it 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.940
 relaxed that eventually ends up going up 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.709
 without realizing it and you're not with so much 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.180
 headache so nobody have 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.920
 chosen enchantment we want to give you 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.660
 we simply give it to manufacture 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.610
 we give like this and we already have our fence 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.350
 is delighted to do it with a 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.790
 spell we're going to have to buy it 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.530
 get the other way I at least know 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.209
 who sell it here in dragon basin 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.310
 with each dragon is what is then in 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.320
 white race where burst the here 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.000
 over we're going to dragon basin and 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.720
 we have to talk to his magician with his 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.299
 kit said 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.860
 we come here and we come with sir be of 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.480
 step we can steal a few gems 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.680
 that it 's no problem to steal it 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.990
 and we say that it has the advantage of thinking 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.710
 that you dedicated to magic I think that you 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.630
 will interest this 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.780
 if then we have to go to the section 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.430
 of books to buy the grimoire 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.180
 soul trap if the target dies in 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.660
 60 seconds will fill a gem of the soul what 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.230
 we buy we go out we go to the inventory 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.620
 Now that we have it, we are going to books that 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.530
 they're here and I'm giving you the best 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.300
 the xbox and we have already learned trap from 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.380
 weapons now well for us to be able 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.730
 use this spell and you have 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.410
 meaning then we have to get a 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.480
 gem of the soul that we can therefore take 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.830
 the borrowed this kind sir is also 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.420
 true that we could buy the but 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.280
 being able to take the free one so that 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.050
 buy it and once we have chosen to 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.000
 our victim we have to select 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.440
 the spell is a conjuration girl 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.240
 soul trap we give here to 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 select to equip us what and 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.620
 simply pointing to the goal to which 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.780
 want to rob it because the soul 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.730
 we cast the spell 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.290
 and as you see now I'm going to put the dough 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.060
 but if they are fixed then a color remains 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.250
 blue milestone that means that if in less 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.770
 of 60 seconds dies that he will die 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.400
 we are going to be able to capture your soul 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.400
 we give a blow sorry cow 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.990
 and we already have the soul captured the other 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.520
 so it 's in singing a weapon from 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.500
 a lovely arcane I for example what 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.449
 I'm going to do from my house and then 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.810
 I'm going to love disenchanting I'm not going to 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.639
 love a crystal mass we come 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.249
 here enchantment and we choose trap of 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.669
 soul 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:55.529
 and what is the good thing that happens 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.049
 we choose the duration the goal is such 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.699
 let's choose 8 what happens so what 

00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:01.049
 bad of this is that it will be tied to 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.189
 level of enchantment that you have 

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.739
 the truth that happened a bit of magic 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.929
 so I do not have it I have 100 

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.189
 but but I do not have any thing any 

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:10.259
 added skill and that's why they are not 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.029
 very good but good let's see how 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.849
 is done let's choose for example a 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:16.109
 gem of the common soul that I do not want either 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.449
 more and now we give the X to 

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:20.249
 We make it like that and we have 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.279
 our enchanted crystal mass with 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.539
 with soul trap well and now that 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.949
 we have chosen our goal as 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.509
 brave people that we are then 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.759
 we just came here acaponeta 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.759
 my poor chicken and we give him with the dough 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.210
 and as you see it puts soul captured so 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.730
 we already have the soul of the poor caponata 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.320
 in our soul gem I have to say 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.970
 that the enchantment of this trap of 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.770
 soul to love the weapon because I would 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.180
 I found disenchanting a weapon that already 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.680
 I was delighted with this I do not know if what 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.940
 will sell elsewhere but it is not 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.740
 likely most likely that the 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.000
 magicians from different parts the 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.710
 that teach you with healing and all that 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.090
 then also have the enchantment of 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.350
 anyway if you go around the world catching 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.520
 the most likely thing is that you 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.170
 find this spell late or 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.340
 early fine well up here 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.050
 tutorial today I hope you have them 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.370
 served as a personal opinion as I 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.020
 I prefer a thousand times the spell I think 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.970
 which is much more comfortable and also not 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.010
 you have to have enchantment gone up 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.510
 nothing like that so nothing like always 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.860
 comment what they like what they do not and 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.860
 see you in the next good video
