daily<00:01:20.280> struggle<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.240> know

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
daily struggle because as we all know

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
daily struggle because as we all know
this<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.189> grind<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
this can be very much of a grind and
that<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> leads<00:01:24.420> me<00:01:24.570> into<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.960> next<00:01:25.170> set

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
up the weight one more time so my goal

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.309 
up the weight one more time so my goal
here<00:03:17.970> was<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.180> work<00:03:18.420> up<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.720> heaviest<00:03:19.019> set

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319

being 5 45 for set of 5 however going

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.300 
being 5 45 for set of 5 however going
through<00:03:24.360> here<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.049> first<00:03:25.349> rep<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> very<00:03:25.920> slow

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
through here the first rep is very slow

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.130 
through here the first rep is very slow
the<00:03:26.790> second<00:03:27.150> rep<00:03:27.299> actually<00:03:27.750> feels<00:03:27.989> pretty

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
the second rep actually feels pretty

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.710

good<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.549> third<00:03:29.790> rep<00:03:30.000> just<00:03:30.420> doesn't

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
good and the third rep just doesn't

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.270 
good and the third rep just doesn't
happen<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.170> what<00:03:31.319> do<00:03:31.379> i<00:03:31.470> do<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:32.040> ditch<00:03:32.250> it

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
happen so what do i do I just ditch it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.710 
happen so what do i do I just ditch it
because<00:03:32.760> again<00:03:33.030> I'm<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.540> for<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
because again I'm in it for the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.820 
because again I'm in it for the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
longevity here and don't want to

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.860 
longevity here and don't want to
necessarily<00:03:34.920> hurt<00:03:35.430> myself<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:36.659> moved

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
necessarily hurt myself so we then moved

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.110 
necessarily hurt myself so we then moved
on<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.049> three<00:03:37.590> sets<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:38.069> eight<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.849> heavy

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120

stiff-legged deadlift done from a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.830 
stiff-legged deadlift done from a
deficit<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.849> about<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> four-inch<00:03:42.299> deficit

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840
