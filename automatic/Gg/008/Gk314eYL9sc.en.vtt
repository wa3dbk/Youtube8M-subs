00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.549
 I chose ice cream gold card 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.889
 nougat to make a dessert in 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.309
 playing on the marriage of nougat and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.620
 apricot 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.230
 I'm going to make an apricot coulis and 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.350
 then a kind of fruit nougatine 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.780
 dry to remind the side a little 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.910
 crunchy nougat and here I go 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.040
 assemble these three elements into one 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.690
 greedy plate so for the grout 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.570
 of apricots we take 100 g of apricots 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.339
 dry 20 g sugar 1 half lemon juice 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 and water for dried fruits 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.929
 caramelized 60 grams of fruits 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.809
 dry so to choose there I made half to 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.570
 mende half pistachios and 100 g of sugar 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.449
 and then of course ice cream 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.409
 nougat gold card 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.239
 so here I will prepare my package 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.839
 apricots game but without 50 milliliters 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.760
 water but 100 g apricots and my 20 g 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.559
 of sugars 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.729
 I bring to a boil and let 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 cook for about five minutes 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.500
 So here but apricots cook 5 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 minutes in the water with the sugar good 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.850
 now I'm going to mix them then me 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 I add half a lemon juice because 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 that I want to accent a little bit 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.560
 acidity with lemon juice and I 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.560
 I'll simply mix all 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.280
 so here is my apricot coulis and 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.509
 so take the well mix well 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.070
 long for it to be homogeneous one 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.899
 not want it to remain two pieces or of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.119
 fibers I'll let it cool 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.829
 because it's hot there we'll go to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.390
 the preparation of caramelized fruits 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.250
 so it's on the principle of a us 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 spoil in it will have to make a caramel 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.329
 in caramel it's often scary 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 but it's not that complicated 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.149
 my technique is to put a small 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.590
 little water in my pots so 40 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.960
 grams of water per 100 grams of sugar 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.450
 I heat the water then I put 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.570
 my sugar and well it prevents it from taking 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.969
 in mass so I put my name to heat 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.320
 my last I pour my sugar in 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.700
 paying attention from step to master on 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.409
 the edges of the pan I let myself 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.270
 really well in the middle so now 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.249
 we do not move, we just leave 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.910
 sugar melt in the water while my 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:11.989
 caramel thigh v went but fruits 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.980
 dried on a sheet of parchment paper 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.349
 and I will gently pour 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.720
 on my fruit so it's not going all the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.099
 cover but it does not matter because 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.250
 that in the end what we want is just 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.129
 to have a negative I use my paper 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 to sink the caramel that sank 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.650
 on the edges so here is the hand 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.390
 danger let it cool 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.220
 quietly so I resume my 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.940
 nougatine of earlier who had the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.010
 time to harden 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.250
 I'm going to cut and crushed so I 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.019
 take my big knife the idea I 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.549
 want to have big chunks and 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.970
 small pieces to play on 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.159
 textures 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.930
 here I chose to take 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.379
 the combination of a glass and a glass 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.959
 slate 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.209
 so I'll start by doing a 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.470
 Grout line on my slate 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.569
 here I did shows and grout game 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.030
 now I'm going to put some piece 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.150
 crisp so I take my ice cream a 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.790
 ice cream nougat gold card 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:15.640
 I'm going to make balls this time 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:18.430
 I'm going to put in my pot so 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.660
 I'm going to put just a little tip 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.410
 apricot coulis that will come 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.319
 bring sound and acidity then I finish 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.290
 with crispy dried fruit 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.810
 finely crushed so here is a pretty 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.239
 circles and made with a cream 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.549
 iced nougat golden card apricots 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.010
 dry nuts and here we come 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.579
 to a plate like me I find quite 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.579
 gourmet
