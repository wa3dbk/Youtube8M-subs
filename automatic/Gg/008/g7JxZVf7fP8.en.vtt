there<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> springtime<00:02:00.390> polybag<00:02:00.899> set<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
there is the springtime polybag set and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
there is the springtime polybag set and
i'm<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.659> getting<00:02:03.659> more<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.079> those

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
i'm going to be getting more of those

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.100 
i'm going to be getting more of those
because<00:02:04.710> i<00:02:05.009> want<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> trees<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
because i want to use the trees for the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.330 
because i want to use the trees for the
city<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:09.929> back<00:02:10.080> over<00:02:10.560> here<00:02:10.830> for

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
city but if you go back over here for

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.030 
city but if you go back over here for
more

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
more

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.460 
more
and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.310> make<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.610> clear<00:02:15.090> again<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:16.230> one

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and then make it clear again this one

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.759 
and then make it clear again this one
right<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:17.489> modular<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.989> own<00:02:19.170> custom

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
right here this modular is my own custom

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.400 
right here this modular is my own custom
build<00:02:20.010> i<00:02:20.250> use<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.790> mason<00:02:21.300> bricks<00:02:21.599> on<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
build i use the mason bricks on it the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.820 
build i use the mason bricks on it the
dark<00:02:22.860> tan<00:02:23.310> version<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.230> honestly<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.470> like

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
dark tan version and honestly I like

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.920 
dark tan version and honestly I like
that<00:02:26.040> break<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> lot<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.330> good<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.569> use

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that break a lot it's really good to use

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.190 
that break a lot it's really good to use
for<00:02:28.200> Lego<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> modular<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.989> want<00:02:31.140> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
for Lego like a modular if you want to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.809 
for Lego like a modular if you want to
make<00:02:31.290> your<00:02:31.380> own<00:02:31.470> custom<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.160> actually<00:02:32.640> fits

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
make your own custom one actually fits

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.259 
make your own custom one actually fits
in<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.180> nicely<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:34.170> my<00:02:34.200> city<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.269> I'm

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
in really nicely with my city and I'm

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.910 
in really nicely with my city and I'm
actually<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.810> thinking<00:02:37.440> about<00:02:37.530> doing<00:02:37.769> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
actually going to thinking about doing a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.699 
actually going to thinking about doing a
modular<00:02:38.340> review<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:39.000> myself<00:02:39.750> my<00:02:40.200> modulars

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
modular review of myself my modulars

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.820 
modular review of myself my modulars
because<00:02:41.099> I've<00:02:41.250> actually<00:02:41.840> detailed<00:02:42.840> inside<00:02:43.410> of

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
because I've actually detailed inside of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.030 
because I've actually detailed inside of
the<00:02:43.950> modulars<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.640> make<00:02:44.790> them<00:02:44.970> more<00:02:45.450> unique<00:02:46.040> so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the modulars to make them more unique so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.890 
the modulars to make them more unique so
if<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.580> would<00:02:47.819> like<00:02:47.970> me<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.510> something

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
if you would like me to do something

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.460 
if you would like me to do something
like<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.430> make<00:02:50.610> videos<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.470> just

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
like that and make videos like this just

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
like that and make videos like this just
tell<00:02:52.680> me<00:02:52.829> I'm<00:02:52.950> serious<00:02:53.340> I'm<00:02:53.549> up<00:02:54.269> for<00:02:54.420> the

with you didn't tell me what you guys

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.850 
with you didn't tell me what you guys
think<00:03:05.360> news<00:03:06.360> building<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:06.959> got<00:03:07.260> was<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
think news building that I got was the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.890 
think news building that I got was the
parish<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.310> restaurant<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.599> I'm<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:09.780> going

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
parish and restaurant so I'm just going

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.089 
parish and restaurant so I'm just going
to<00:03:09.989> actually<00:03:10.980> go<00:03:11.519> over<00:03:11.549> here<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:13.079> was<00:03:13.590> not<00:03:14.040> a

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
to actually go over here so it was not a

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.580 
to actually go over here so it was not a
complicated<00:03:14.730> build<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.930> was<00:03:16.200> actually<00:03:16.560> pretty

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
complicated build it was actually pretty

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.789 
complicated build it was actually pretty
easy<00:03:16.859> i<00:03:17.630> completed<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.900> about<00:03:19.200> eight<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
easy i completed in about eight and a

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.849 
easy i completed in about eight and a
half<00:03:19.829> hours<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:22.019> between<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.530> vid<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.829> a

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
half hours and in between the vid and a

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.680 
half hours and in between the vid and a
half<00:03:23.040> hours<00:03:23.370> i<00:03:23.549> had<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.880> take<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> break<00:03:24.450> because

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
half hours i had to take a break because

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.759 
half hours i had to take a break because
it<00:03:25.079> was<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> lot<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.620> work<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:27.420> honestly<00:03:28.290> Lego

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
it was a lot of work I and honestly Lego

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.330 
it was a lot of work I and honestly Lego

were<00:03:41.069> right<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:42.030> set<00:03:42.480> does<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.410> um<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:44.760> studs

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
were right the set does is um two studs

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.479 
were right the set does is um two studs
away<00:03:45.480> actually<00:03:46.380> three<00:03:46.560> stud<00:03:46.920> three<00:03:47.340> or<00:03:47.459> four

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
away actually three stud three or four

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.360 
away actually three stud three or four
steps<00:03:47.880> away<00:03:48.060> away<00:03:48.959> from<00:03:49.260> which<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.950> normal

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
steps away away from which the normal

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.900 
steps away away from which the normal
lining<00:03:50.880> would<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.209> at<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.540> wall<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.910> honestly

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
lining would be at the wall and honestly

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.270 
lining would be at the wall and honestly
I<00:03:54.410> believe<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.590> would<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:55.799> right<00:03:56.010> but

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
I believe that would be right but

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.460 
I believe that would be right but
honestly<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.299> think<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:57.959> perfect

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
honestly I like it I think it's perfect

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.750 
honestly I like it I think it's perfect
right<00:03:58.590> there<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.220> were<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.579> the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
right there if you were to have the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.330 
right there if you were to have the
