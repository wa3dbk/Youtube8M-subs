John's reputation never really recovered

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.949 
John's reputation never really recovered
and<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.470> they<00:03:05.830> were<00:03:06.390> not<00:03:07.390> looked<00:03:07.690> upon

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and so they were not looked upon

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.360 
and so they were not looked upon
favorably<00:03:08.160> after<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:09.700> there<00:03:10.480> were<00:03:11.370> they

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.930 
became very wealthy they were bought out
I<00:03:15.790> think<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.300> was<00:03:16.420> nineteen<00:03:17.940> seventeen

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
I think it was nineteen seventeen

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.310 
I think it was nineteen seventeen
eighteen<00:03:19.570> for<00:03:19.810> 25<00:03:20.440> 27<00:03:21.160> million<00:03:21.549> from<00:03:22.540> Ford<00:03:22.989> so

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
eighteen for 25 27 million from Ford so

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.110 
eighteen for 25 27 million from Ford so
they<00:03:23.530> had<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> lot<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.340> nice<00:03:25.209> toys<00:03:25.690> yachts

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120

mansions and so forth and so on and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.699 
mansions and so forth and so on and
probably<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> little<00:03:34.180> too<00:03:34.299> much<00:03:35.130> access<00:03:36.130> to

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
probably a little too much access to

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.550 
probably a little too much access to
libations<00:03:38.709> but<00:03:39.010> anyway<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.959> reason<00:03:40.989> you're

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560
