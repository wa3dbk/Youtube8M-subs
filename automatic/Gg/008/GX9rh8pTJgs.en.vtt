so first thing you want to do when you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.169 
so first thing you want to do when you
spawn<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.009> look<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.460> perk<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.910> if<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
spawn is you look at that perk and if it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
spawn is you look at that perk and if it
is<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.809> color<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.710> restart<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
is because you color you restart that

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
is because you color you restart that
game<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.630> speed<00:00:19.020> Cola

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
game because we do not like speed Cola

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.620 
game because we do not like speed Cola
we<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.740> juggernog<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.939> we'll<00:00:21.210> probably

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
we like juggernog so we'll probably

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.810 
we like juggernog so we'll probably
switch<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.439> most<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> time<00:00:23.220> alternate

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
switch it most of the time alternate

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.970 
switch it most of the time alternate
sometimes<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.539> doesn't<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:24.960> once<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> got

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
sometimes it doesn't and once you got

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
sometimes it doesn't and once you got
that<00:00:26.010> jugs<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.880> green<00:00:27.150> light<00:00:27.359> you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that jugs you got that green light you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.689 
that jugs you got that green light you
start<00:00:27.810> knifing<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.380> knifing<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.340> pregame

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
start knifing them knifing this pregame

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
start knifing them knifing this pregame
is<00:00:30.060> possibly<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> most<00:00:30.869> important<00:00:31.500> because

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
is possibly the most important because

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.410 
is possibly the most important because
if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.250> no<00:00:32.460> points<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.270> not

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
if you get no points now you're not

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.450 
if you get no points now you're not
going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.750> enough<00:00:33.780> ammo<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:35.160> enough

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
going to have enough ammo to get enough

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
going to have enough ammo to get enough
points<00:00:35.790> later<00:00:36.180> once<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.110> rape

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
points later once you have your rape

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
points later once you have your rape
train<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> check

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
train going so you really want to check

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.740 
train going so you really want to check
these<00:00:39.629> two<00:00:39.930> pools<00:00:40.260> most<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.790> lot

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
these two pools most of the time a lot

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.389 
these two pools most of the time a lot
spawning<00:00:43.140> each<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.710> even<00:00:43.950> check<00:00:44.190> these

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
spawning each you can even check these

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 
spawning each you can even check these
sides<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.570> um<00:00:45.809> most<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.739> them<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
sides but um most of them are going to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
sides but um most of them are going to
spawn<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> middle<00:00:47.910> pool<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.480> soon<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
spawn that middle pool as soon as you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.529 
spawn that middle pool as soon as you
spawn<00:00:49.280> you'll<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.460> easy<00:00:50.640> access<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.180> them

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
spawn you'll have easy access to them

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.450 
spawn you'll have easy access to them
and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.350> soon<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.800> hear<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.190> beep

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and then as soon as you hear that beep

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.080 
and then as soon as you hear that beep
you<00:00:53.940> run<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.920> tip<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.520> always

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you run that first the one tip is always

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.869 
you run that first the one tip is always
reverse<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> first<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.859> least<00:00:59.160> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
reverse that the first time at least if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
reverse that the first time at least if
not<00:01:00.030> twice<00:01:00.570> reverse<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> first<00:01:01.590> time<00:01:01.710> then

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
not twice reverse it the first time then

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
not twice reverse it the first time then
there<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.370> only<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.510> hard<00:01:03.870> pass

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
there will only be about one hard pass

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.890 
there will only be about one hard pass
that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.729> through<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that you have to get through and with a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
that you have to get through and with a
little<00:01:07.110> skill<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:08.070> past<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
little skill you can get past that so

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
little skill you can get past that so
yeah<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.290> usually<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
yeah there's usually going to be one the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
yeah there's usually going to be one the
easiest<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.290> throw<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
easiest thing to do is just throw a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
easiest thing to do is just throw a
grenade<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> pool<00:01:14.520> sideways<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> then

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
grenade in that pool sideways and then

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.940 
grenade in that pool sideways and then
one<00:01:15.810> past<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> it'll<00:01:16.560> give<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
one past it it'll give you like a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.070 
one past it it'll give you like a
thousand<00:01:17.490> points<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.479> shoot<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> train

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
thousand points you can shoot the train

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
thousand points you can shoot the train
but<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> fastest<00:01:19.770> way<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.790> throw

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but the fastest way to do it just throw

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
but the fastest way to do it just throw
a<00:01:21.060> grenade<00:01:21.270> run<00:01:21.900> past<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.409> sorry<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
a grenade run past it sorry about the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
a grenade run past it sorry about the
lag<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.490> video<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.960> should<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.350> an

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
lag of this video and you should have an

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.109 
lag of this video and you should have an
easy<00:01:25.740> time<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.610> run<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.090> grab<00:01:27.689> jugs<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
easy time just run up and grab jugs and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
easy time just run up and grab jugs and
then<00:01:30.119> teleport<00:01:30.780> while<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.409> drinking<00:01:31.650> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
then teleport while you're drinking it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
then teleport while you're drinking it
just<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> take<00:01:34.259> some

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just just this is going to take some

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.080 
just just this is going to take some
practice<00:01:34.680> maybe<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.700> doing<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> with

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
practice maybe if you're doing it with

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.380 
practice maybe if you're doing it with
multiple<00:01:36.479> people<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.920> people<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.579> stand<00:01:39.090> up

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
multiple people the people can stand up
