00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.309
 hello and welcome it was gone 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.009
 the few days ago already a hands-on 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 to mode 36 the uploaded but the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 in my opinion the second most beautiful smart 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 watch that is currently with android 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.039
 I did not show you that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 here she is this is the lg watch a how 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 it is easy to recognize that is also 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.859
 again a round smartphones or a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.009
 with a round display namely with 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.510
 a 13 inch oled display that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.489
 with 320 x 320 pixels at about 348 pixels 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 per inch dissolves and the display that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 really makes a very very good one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 impression what I can say so far 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.649
 I have to be really good 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 look at the clock otherwise 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 a little closer I'll look again 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.789
 ran 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 you see the bracelet here, too 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.449
 By the way, calfskin is her but 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.160
 can also be easily 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 exchange similar to that already from 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.969
 the normal watch knows but that here 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 what you have already seen in me 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.239
 combination quite liked the clock 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 Bends she looks very high quality 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.659
 we find the bottom again 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.490
 contacts for the loading part 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 and of course this is one too 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
 Heart rate monitor definitely something very 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.380
 very praiseworthy is the diva cher comes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.049
 with a core core snapdragon 400 quad 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.750
 know core with 1 2 ghz as well as already 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.630
 The quad is then 512 mb 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 RAM and 1 410 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 The powerful battery of the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.369
 actually for very good terms 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.840
 should you see her right one 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.880
 physical parbat with that one can to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 For example, get off the clock to come 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.540
 of course with and world where with the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.979
 different index cards you can find here 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.869
 unfortunately you could already see it here 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.000
 this fair clock not many on it 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.950
 Let's have a look at the watch phrases 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.700
 Lg has a lot more here 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.409
 to come up with 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.329
 and sometimes at night after are here 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.100
 really some very nice with it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.290
 This watch really like a normal one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.729
 clock and that is in mine 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.350
 at least with a smart watch 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.820
 Of course, it is also very important 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.409
 always taste 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 the clock or the frame 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.549
 is made of stainless steel that feels 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.950
 very very high quality one must 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.649
 but say similar to the mode 36 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.069
 Here, too, the field was a thicker one 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.110
 Clock 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.679
 that should not be except 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.469
 eight 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.450
 otherwise it is also ip67 certified 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.340
 So against dust and against water 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.140
 protected which for some very much 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.420
 you might be interesting, you see 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.180
 Display excellent condition the clock 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.430
 Of course it will also be behind the ears 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.739
 assist mode and the OLED display 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.359
 is doing very well here too good 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.730
 Last time I have for you again 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:36.090
 Hand model played and how he sees it 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.590
 trt watch also looks at the poor really good 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.150
 from at least my opinion and 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.859
 also quality here you see again 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.989
 a size comparison to one more or 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.359
 less normal you can see it already 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.430
 diva cher is a whole nice piece 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.470
 thicker but they are just like one 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.810
 looking like a normal watch is very 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.169
 high quality around that definitely gave me 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.849
 on 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.519
 what is there to say the clock will be 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.799
 available from october for 299 euros 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.150
 his and that of those dealers 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.099
 I hope them the video has given you 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.799
 Please thank me for watching and 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.799
