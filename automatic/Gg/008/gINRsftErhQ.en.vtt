was going wrong with it what why it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.960 
was going wrong with it what why it
didn't<00:03:08.269> work<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.780> why<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.109> couldn't<00:03:09.560> work<00:03:09.970> for

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
didn't work and why it couldn't work for

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.090 
didn't work and why it couldn't work for
the<00:03:11.090> average<00:03:11.239> person<00:03:11.920> unless<00:03:12.920> they're

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
the average person unless they're

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.800 
the average person unless they're
willing<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.430> work<00:03:13.519> other<00:03:13.940> jobs<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.540> pay<00:03:14.690> the

willing to work other jobs to pay the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.920 
willing to work other jobs to pay the
bills<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.030> said<00:03:17.239> this<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.600> how<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:17.810> gonna

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
bills and I said this is how I'm gonna

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.770 
bills and I said this is how I'm gonna
make<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.170> difference<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.090> started<00:03:20.600> doing

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
make a difference and so I started doing

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.360 
make a difference and so I started doing
it<00:03:21.109> I<00:03:22.060> didn't<00:03:23.060> realize<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.980> negativity<00:03:24.980> that

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it I didn't realize the negativity that

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.750 
it I didn't realize the negativity that
the<00:03:25.940> parents<00:03:26.329> would<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.480> against

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the parents would have against

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.570 
the parents would have against
but<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> couldn't<00:03:29.150> blame<00:03:29.360> them<00:03:29.600> because<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.580> man

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
but I couldn't blame them because a man

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.730 
but I couldn't blame them because a man
running<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.360> snow<00:03:32.600> cone<00:03:32.810> truck<00:03:32.840> could<00:03:33.590> be

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
running a snow cone truck could be

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.630 
running a snow cone truck could be
negative<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.380> took<00:03:36.620> 20<00:03:36.950> years<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.459> really

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
negative so it took 20 years to really

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.250 
negative so it took 20 years to really
get<00:03:37.940> get<00:03:38.480> going<00:03:38.840> well<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.410> said<00:03:39.740> 20<00:03:40.100> years<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
get get going well I said 20 years to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
doing it for 31 years

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.510 
doing it for 31 years
needless<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.160> say<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.670> works<00:03:58.940> quite<00:03:59.180> well<00:03:59.270> now

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
needless to say it works quite well now

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.970 
needless to say it works quite well now
but<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:01.670> was<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.820> very<00:04:02.120> long<00:04:02.420> dry<00:04:02.930> spell<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.800> say

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
but it was a very long dry spell to say

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.920 
but it was a very long dry spell to say
the<00:04:04.040> least

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
the least

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.690 
the least
and<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.140> course<00:04:06.350> there<00:04:07.070> was<00:04:07.190> never<00:04:07.430> about

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
and of course there was never about

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.880 
and of course there was never about
profit<00:04:08.300> other<00:04:08.570> than<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.019> break<00:04:09.260> even<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:09.800> I

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
profit other than to break even if I
