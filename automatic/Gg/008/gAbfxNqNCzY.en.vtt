00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello here cristina register of plays 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.360
 piano dot com 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.210
 in this video I want to explain how 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.160
 rather, above all, what is a fall 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.810
 how to do it and above all how not to do it 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.949
 let's define what a fall is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 fall is a movement that starts 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 from top comes down and yes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.310
 system 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310
 ok 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.239
 so why did I want to talk to you about 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.059
 simply fall of does for the fact 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.220
 which is not that much use for the songs 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.140
 in fact, it serves as a study method 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.589
 I said how to do it and how not to do it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.150
 because in any case it is an advanced method 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.850
 that absolutely must be done with a 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.110
 certain criterion and above all necessary 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.559
 know how to do it so let's see how 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.369
 do 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.110
 a fall and how to make sure that the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 hand return to the starting position 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.080
 then I read the fall attention 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 that in the fall the hand in theory then 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.860
 it is never really so however in theory 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.700
 should be relaxed should 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.700
 just go to dead weight 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.679
 you can make the dead weight fall if you leave 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.679
 then the flat fingers like this here 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.689
 be careful, I'm not playing 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.640
 must play only a note I'm playing 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.659
 so many nights right now 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.659
 this is a fall 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.560
 you will tell me what the fall is for 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.810
 simply as I told you the method of 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.000
 study I want to share with you that 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.660
 I also learned after a while anyway 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.260
 few years of study because I'll explain it to you 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.820
 because then we must first have 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.750
 that trust anyway to leave 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.750
 go to the keyboard 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.070
 so in theory the arm should 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.000
 just being that is very light yes 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.000
 falls on the keyboard 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.319
 at this point the finger must be raised e 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.730
 resume the correct position of the 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.040
 on the keyboard 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.040
 so I fall 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.099
 that is, the wrist is left alone 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.250
 go so much your fingers anchor you to 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.250
 keys 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.200
 begin to pull up one finger first and 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.939
 pull up your wrist because you need to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.159
 be careful then the first 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.370
 first reason you will understand it is not 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.139
 getting hurt ie meaning in the moment in 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.620
 to which I fall 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:06.349
 it's not that risk of hurting me though 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.250
 great care must be taken in 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.200
 moment when I want to pick up the la 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.290
 keyboard position 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.620
 at the beginning it is done with a finger and then 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.250
 it is necessary however to pay attention that the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.530
 wrist is not known to be rigid and in each 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.319
 case the finger has to make a little effort 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.810
 to get up 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.079
 so how do you repeat and if I don't put a 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.930
 study method in what sense it has 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.599
 this method simply by 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.419
 strengthen the finger 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.639
 ok because the finger still brings up 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.879
 all in a natural way 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.810
 at the beginning this part will bend 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:53.780
 because it is normal and even more than this 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.739
 just this phalanx here then one 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.680
 Once you want to do an exercise, it will come 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.680
 automatic as well for example with the third 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.230
 and pull up your whole hand 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.110
 this is a type of technique that has 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.820
 wanted to share with you but not you 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.080
 I advise you to practice less 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.530
 that you are not followed by a teacher 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.329
 because I myself was precisely 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.000
 followed by a teacher who has me 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:26.760
 just taught how to do but know 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.760
 which is a type of technique that exists 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:36.350
 then total relaxation of the wrist 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:44.300
 then do some relaxation checks 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:49.500
 pull up and get to position your wrist 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.380
 to natural taxation 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.900
 I repeat, however, to do it only in 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.150
 presence of a teacher who knows that 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.310
 know this type of technique for 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.200
 this video is everything if you haven't already 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.090
 done I invite you to download four 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.760

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.700
 piano from scratch and step by step
