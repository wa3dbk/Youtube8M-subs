or usually going to be 1 2 3 4 5 and
then<00:00:44.630> most<00:00:44.840> vehicles<00:00:45.080> are<00:00:45.260> going<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.440> be<00:00:45.590> over

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
then most vehicles are going to be over

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.370 
then most vehicles are going to be over
and<00:00:46.820> down<00:00:47.000> for<00:00:47.330> a<00:00:47.390> verse<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:47.930> this<00:00:48.110> one<00:00:48.260> is

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
and down for a verse but this one is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.820 
and down for a verse but this one is
actually<00:00:48.500> all<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.160> way<00:00:49.250> over<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.730> up<00:00:50.350> okay<00:00:51.350> so

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
actually all the way over and up okay so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.160 
actually all the way over and up okay so
we'll<00:00:51.980> start<00:00:52.190> off<00:00:52.280> in<00:00:52.490> first<00:00:52.850> gear<00:00:53.170> right

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
we'll start off in first gear right

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.319 
we'll start off in first gear right
there<00:00:54.380> we<00:00:54.740> got<00:00:54.860> our<00:00:54.950> foot<00:00:55.280> on<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.730> clutch<00:00:55.760> and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
moving so now all I have to do is give

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.690 
moving so now all I have to do is give
it<00:01:42.740> gas<00:01:44.320> ok<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.950> when<00:01:46.070> I'm<00:01:46.160> ready<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.520> change

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
it gas ok and when I'm ready to change

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.650 
it gas ok and when I'm ready to change
gears<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.620> simply<00:01:48.620> put<00:01:48.800> my<00:01:48.920> foot<00:01:49.160> on<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.550> clutch

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
gears I simply put my foot on the clutch

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.880 
gears I simply put my foot on the clutch
ok<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.610> shift<00:01:52.610> into<00:01:52.820> second<00:01:53.300> gear<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.830> then<00:01:54.830> I

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
ok and shift into second gear and then I

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.290 
ok and shift into second gear and then I
would<00:01:55.100> slowly<00:01:55.370> let<00:01:55.580> my<00:01:55.700> foot<00:01:55.910> off<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.270> clutch

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
would slowly let my foot off the clutch

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.600 
would slowly let my foot off the clutch
again<00:01:56.680> ok<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.790> let's<00:01:59.000> try<00:01:59.150> that<00:02:00.400> so<00:02:01.400> I'm<00:02:01.460> taking

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
again ok so let's try that so I'm taking

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.320 
again ok so let's try that so I'm taking
off<00:02:01.850> from<00:02:01.970> first<00:02:02.030> gear<00:02:02.450> ok<00:02:03.580> slowly<00:02:04.580> let<00:02:05.180> my

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
off from first gear ok slowly let my

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.810 
off from first gear ok slowly let my
foot<00:02:05.630> off<00:02:06.190> careful<00:02:07.190> not<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.400> stall<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
foot off careful not to stall the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.250 
foot off careful not to stall the
vehicle<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:09.320> then<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.190> switch<00:02:10.429> into<00:02:10.580> second

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
vehicle and then to switch into second

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.400 
vehicle and then to switch into second
down<00:02:12.550> into<00:02:13.550> second<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.060> slowly<00:02:14.900> up<00:02:15.080> my<00:02:15.200> foot

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
down into second and slowly up my foot

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.490 
down into second and slowly up my foot
out<00:02:15.440> ok<00:02:16.270> now<00:02:17.270> this<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.900> basics<00:02:18.350> we're

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
out ok now this is just the basics we're

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.449 
out ok now this is just the basics we're
going<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.920> start<00:02:19.070> using<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
going to have to start using the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.740 
going to have to start using the
accelerator<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.239> just<00:02:20.420> wanted<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.660> keep
