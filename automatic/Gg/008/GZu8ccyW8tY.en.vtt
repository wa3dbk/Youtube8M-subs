00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.020
 Italy I was reading FIOS pay online 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.470
 News site today and they have a story about two writers and authors 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.099
 David powers the King who is the Mormon and that will be part of the story 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.250
 Related to this story 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.440
 And Michael Jensen now the authors were getting too 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.690
 Very close to the deployment of young adults 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.400
 Fantasy novel science fiction type that they have written together 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 There was even hang up when the information about the CV of them 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.750
 The publisher was therefore provided with information provided by David Powers 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.200
 Little King Bio-propaganda is overly go at the back of the book is fine 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.379
 But Michael Janson Jensen was a surprise to everyone 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.180
 Missing line when I got the sample back from the publisher was missing 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.870
 Line 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 He lives in Salt Lake City with his friend 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 Thus the dogs are therefore the acquisition editor of the publisher 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.379
 He wrote the cedar fort in an e-mail why this line was gold from a stranger to Michael 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.230
 Jensen wrote 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.750
 Including the vital font, and they got it back without it, they said 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.240
 You worried about your bio and wondered what effect it would have with 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.650
 Mormon our buyers 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.330
 So I talked with the rice fort owner of Lyle Mortimer about it 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.740
 He says we can not risk sabotaging our relationship with then 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.650
 Mormon says that you live with your boyfriend so we need to cut 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.130
 This 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.290
 From that Jensen said well well what if we just replaced the word with her boyfriend 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.380
 Word partner 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.630
 Or they did not like either they said 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.299
 Anything that might even hint you are being gay 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.860
 It will hurt us even to refuse the book to be the right book 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 Posted by Fort Cedar 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.549
 I've got Avery getting the rights of the book they've written 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.600
 I believe that Louis Cedar fort is clearly biased with intolerance here 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.869
 This is business-based intolerance and in other words they know that to them 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:54.649
 public 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 Sewing sews between them and the inherent intolerance against gays 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.149
 Of the Mormon Church of the Church of the Saints of the Last Days it is a bad deed 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.700
 So hint 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.990
 That the person you publish the book is gay 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.379
 This is a very very sad case of affairs with within the Mormons 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:11.879
 The 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.599
 Certainly it's it's a business decision we see business decisions like 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.629
 This is done 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.360
 Daily decisions are not based solely on butter intolerance against 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.040
 The well-being of the citizens of this country and this only 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.890
 This is just a way the business runs in the US and I have to add 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.519
 If your family structure as a Mormon family that is against homosexuality 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.519
 It is so weak that a gay writer 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.780
 Mentioning that he has a partner in his own back in the book 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.920
 Will cause your family to collapse it will cause real chaos 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.140
 For your children I think it is safest to say that your parenting is in question 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.590
 Perhaps your family has big problems if simply 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.970
 One of the two writers referred to their partner or boyfriend in the back up 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.470
 Book - Record 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.629
 It hurts so I would like to ask what happens to the families within the Mormons 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.360
 This church is really a concern for me 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.519
 Yes and I knew it was kinda like a kinda mute what Mormons do in their lives 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.330
 Wu's private life in the church we know they do some 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.450
 Things completely crazy II do not know 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.440
 I really have no idea how this would make any slightest impact on 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.280
 Any of their lives 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.980
 After the expiry of the exhibition begins the bonus show reward offer is available for 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.239
 David Pakman exhibition members who are also by the way submit number one 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.430
 The source of funding for this program was hosted on a bonus presentation today and produced 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.810
 By Luis Producer We will talk about the Tesla model 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.049
 Named the safest car s ever 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.360
 Now this is of course tested after Mitt Romney harnesses the provision of UVA on 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.980
 In a box 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.330
 To Tesla and after Tesla announced that he would be reimbursed 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.000
 The way the government loan faster years is faster than it was 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.620
 Schedule to now Tesla Model S is the safest car name 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.129
 Ever tested and much more David Pakman dot com 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.980
 Cutting membership for registration would be great to have for you 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.330
 As David Pakman member of the show
