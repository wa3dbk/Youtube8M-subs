they're<00:01:33.420> retarded<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.350> hard<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
they're retarded like it's hard to a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
they're retarded like it's hard to a
driver<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.479> definitely<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.140> he

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
driver on and it's definitely like he

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
driver on and it's definitely like he
barely<00:01:37.619> turned<00:01:37.860> nearing<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> wall<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
barely turned nearing the wall but I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.640 
barely turned nearing the wall but I
don't<00:01:39.360> think<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.570> were<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.140> might<00:01:40.560> have

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
don't think they were that might have

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.929 
don't think they were that might have
been<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.340> truthfully

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
been what they are going for truthfully

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
been what they are going for truthfully
they<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.329> game<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:43.049> random<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
they want this game to be as random and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
they want this game to be as random and
crazy<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:44.070> possible<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.240> game-mode

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
crazy as possible and this game-mode

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.200 
crazy as possible and this game-mode
definitely<00:01:46.500> represents<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
definitely represents that it's it's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
definitely represents that it's it's
just<00:01:48.930> very<00:01:49.229> random<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.250> say<00:01:50.549> um

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
just very random that's all I can say um

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
just very random that's all I can say um
the<00:01:51.540> first<00:01:51.780> guns<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.140> start<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.649> are

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the first guns you start out with are

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.819 
the first guns you start out with are
pretty<00:01:53.610> pretty<00:01:54.149> horrible<00:01:54.600> um<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.470> they

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
pretty pretty horrible um I think they

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.859 
pretty pretty horrible um I think they
should<00:01:56.009> buck<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> guns<00:01:56.520> not<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
should buck the guns not because like I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
should buck the guns not because like I
plan<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.439> people<00:01:58.829> using<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.729> truthfully

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
plan on people using them but truthfully

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.719 
plan on people using them but truthfully
people<00:02:01.229> drive<00:02:01.500> people<00:02:01.799> away<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> game

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
people drive people away from the game

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.670 
people drive people away from the game
if<00:02:02.969> they<00:02:03.090> believe<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.689> game<00:02:03.899> may<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
if they believe that the game may have I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.639 
if they believe that the game may have I
don't<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.540> really<00:02:06.540> bad<00:02:06.869> guns<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
don't know really bad guns you know I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.050 
don't know really bad guns you know I
mean<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.459> should<00:02:08.580> buff<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
mean so I think that should buff them a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.510 
mean so I think that should buff them a
little<00:02:09.209> they're<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.110> even<00:02:10.379> close<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> as<00:02:11.400> good

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
little they're not even close to as good

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.890 
little they're not even close to as good
as<00:02:11.730> new<00:02:11.970> weapons<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.450> once<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.660> buy<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> new

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
as new weapons and once you buy a new

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.580 
as new weapons and once you buy a new
weapon

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
weapon

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
weapon
like<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> Auggie<00:02:14.489> see<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.540> much<00:02:15.930> much

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
like the Auggie see here it is much much

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.440 
like the Auggie see here it is much much
better<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.550> kill<00:02:17.910> people<00:02:17.940> really

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
better you can kill people really

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
better you can kill people really
quickly<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> also<00:02:19.349> if<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.739> use<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.280> shotgun

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
quickly and also if you use the shotgun

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.030 
quickly and also if you use the shotgun
the<00:02:20.879> shotgun<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.599> really<00:02:22.170> good<00:02:22.379> too<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.800> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the shotgun is really good too so it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.400 
the shotgun is really good too so it
just<00:02:23.519> kind<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.970> depends<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.540> them<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.290> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
just kind of depends on them but you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
just kind of depends on them but you
pick<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> first<00:02:26.610> starting<00:02:27.030> weapon<00:02:27.360> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
pick up but the first starting weapon is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.530 
pick up but the first starting weapon is
really<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.560> bad<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:30.090> some<00:02:30.299> reason

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
really really bad now for some reason

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
really really bad now for some reason
not<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> lot<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> people<00:02:31.769> play<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.190> game<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
not a lot of people play this game and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.759 
not a lot of people play this game and
when<00:02:32.879> I<00:02:32.910> say<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.360> I'm<00:02:33.750> saying<00:02:34.319> there's<00:02:34.590> like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.150 
80 90 people on at a time and for me
it's<00:02:38.160> like<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:39.060> game<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.890> two<00:02:40.890> different

to play CSS if you think about it I
think<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.010> way<00:03:47.209> it's<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.359> little<00:03:48.599> more

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
think of it that way it's a little more

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.830 
think of it that way it's a little more
fast-paced<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.380> crazy<00:03:49.620> than<00:03:49.859> CSS<00:03:50.340> but<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.389> mean

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
fast-paced and crazy than CSS but I mean

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.240 
fast-paced and crazy than CSS but I mean
it's<00:03:51.989> still<00:03:52.079> close<00:03:52.410> enough<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.889> don't<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.099> mean

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
it's still close enough you don't I mean

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.089 
it's still close enough you don't I mean
it's<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:53.819> a<00:03:54.060> great<00:03:54.599> experience<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.410> I'd

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
it's it's a great experience and I'd

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.680
