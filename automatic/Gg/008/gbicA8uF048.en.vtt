hi<00:00:00.900> everyone<00:00:01.170> and<00:00:01.350> thanks<00:00:01.680> for<00:00:01.770> joining<00:00:01.829> me

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hi everyone and thanks for joining me

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.869 
hi everyone and thanks for joining me
today<00:00:03.529> so<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> video<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.490> had<00:00:05.730> not

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
today so this is a video that I had not

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.059 
today so this is a video that I had not
originally<00:00:06.420> been<00:00:06.569> planning<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.290> making<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
originally been planning on making a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.190 
originally been planning on making a
number<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.580> my<00:00:08.730> students<00:00:09.179> tend<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> hold<00:00:10.080> their

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
number of my students tend to hold their

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.140 
number of my students tend to hold their
left<00:00:10.440> hand<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.950> slightly<00:00:11.429> twisted<00:00:11.969> position

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
left hand in a slightly twisted position

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.039 
left hand in a slightly twisted position
I<00:00:13.190> see<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.370> more<00:00:14.700> often<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.240> adult<00:00:15.599> students

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I see this more often in adult students

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.870 
I see this more often in adult students
but<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.410> an<00:00:16.529> occasional<00:00:17.039> younger<00:00:17.340> student<00:00:17.699> as

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
but in an occasional younger student as

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.380 
but in an occasional younger student as
well<00:00:19.130> I'm<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.550> sure<00:00:20.670> why<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.029> should

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
well I'm not really sure why that should

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359 
well I'm not really sure why that should
be<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.689> may<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.710> spread<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.220> we

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
be it may be that the spread that we

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.340 
be it may be that the spread that we
require<00:00:23.850> our<00:00:23.880> fingers<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> good

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
require our fingers to do for a good

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.009 
require our fingers to do for a good
left-handed<00:00:25.890> technique<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:27.900> bit

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
left-handed technique is a little bit

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.689 
left-handed technique is a little bit
unnatural<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.830> harder<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.550> we

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
unnatural and it's harder to do as we

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.470 
unnatural and it's harder to do as we
get<00:00:29.789> older<00:00:31.219> so<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> refresher<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
get older so just as a refresher a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
get older so just as a refresher a
typical<00:00:34.230> left<00:00:34.530> hand<00:00:34.710> position<00:00:34.860> should<00:00:35.309> look

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
typical left hand position should look

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.880 
typical left hand position should look
something<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.120> this

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
something like this

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.139 
something like this
okay<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.219> again<00:00:39.649> my<00:00:40.649> thumb<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.850> middle

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
okay and again my thumb is in the middle

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.340 
okay and again my thumb is in the middle
of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> back<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> neck<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of the back of the neck and it is a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
of the back of the neck and it is a
little<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.010> bad

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 

so<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.320> those<00:00:49.470> students<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:49.980> seem<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> be

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so on those students that seem to be

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
so on those students that seem to be
experiencing<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.390> situation<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
experiencing this situation and that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
experiencing this situation and that
sometimes<00:00:53.070> twisted<00:00:53.850> perhaps<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.630> this<00:00:55.190> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
sometimes twisted perhaps like this you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.510 
sometimes twisted perhaps like this you
see<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:57.270> hand<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.930> no<00:00:58.140> longer<00:00:58.710> really

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
see that the hand is no longer really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.549 
see that the hand is no longer really
perpendicular<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.809> axis<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
perpendicular to the axis of the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250 
perpendicular to the axis of the
fingerboard<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.840> kind<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
fingerboard and it's it's kind of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.460 
fingerboard and it's it's kind of
twisted<00:01:08.300> one<00:01:09.300> situation<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> can

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
twisted one situation in which it can

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
twisted one situation in which it can
cause<00:01:10.680> trouble<00:01:11.190> is<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.570> extend

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
cause trouble is when we need to extend

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.410 
cause trouble is when we need to extend
our<00:01:13.080> first<00:01:13.290> finger<00:01:13.470> backwards<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:15.000> example

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
our first finger backwards for example

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
our first finger backwards for example
to<00:01:15.600> reach<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.930> b-flat<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> string<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.430> E

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to reach a b-flat on the a string or E

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
to reach a b-flat on the a string or E
flat<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> D<00:01:18.540> string<00:01:19.940> right<00:01:20.940> so<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.390> want

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
flat on the D string right so if I want

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.290 
flat on the D string right so if I want
to<00:01:21.930> extend<00:01:22.800> backwards<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.820> case<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
to extend backwards for in this case and

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.109 
to extend backwards for in this case and
E<00:01:24.479> flat<00:01:24.780> normally<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.649> would<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.610> extend<00:01:26.820> back

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
E flat normally I would just extend back

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.310 
E flat normally I would just extend back
like<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:28.170> hand<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.500> twisted<00:01:29.039> then<00:01:30.289> then<00:01:31.289> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
like so my hand is twisted then then I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.999 
like so my hand is twisted then then I
have<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.039> go<00:01:32.190> like<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:33.890> notice<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have to kind of go like this notice that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.609 
have to kind of go like this notice that
my<00:01:35.130> finger<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.460> sort<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.240> reaching<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.080> it's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
my finger is sort of reaching and it's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
my finger is sort of reaching and it's
reaching<00:01:38.009> backwards<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:38.759> curling

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
reaching backwards and then curling

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
reaching backwards and then curling
forward<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.929> it<00:01:40.500> tends<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.800> be<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
forward and it tends to be kind of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.550 
forward and it tends to be kind of
instant<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> inefficient<00:01:45.560> another

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
instant kind of inefficient another

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.249 
instant kind of inefficient another
situation<00:01:46.830> with<00:01:47.369> which<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.570> interfere

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
situation with which this will interfere

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.529 
situation with which this will interfere
with<00:01:49.320> good<00:01:49.649> technique<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:50.250> barring<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
with good technique is barring of the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.809 
with good technique is barring of the
fingers<00:01:51.929> across<00:01:52.380> more<00:01:53.009> than<00:01:53.069> one<00:01:53.399> string<00:01:55.819> so

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
fingers across more than one string so

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.139 
fingers across more than one string so
we<00:01:56.849> often<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> Barre<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.880> two<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.030> more

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
we often have to Barre on two or more

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.710 
we often have to Barre on two or more
strings<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.599> one<00:02:00.780> finger<00:02:01.640> like<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.479> like

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
strings with one finger like so or like

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.770 
strings with one finger like so or like
so<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.500> again<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.069> our<00:02:05.220> hands<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:06.479> our<00:02:06.660> hands

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
so and again if our hands if our hands

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.109 
so and again if our hands if our hands
is<00:02:06.899> twisted<00:02:07.349> and<00:02:07.470> our<00:02:07.560> fingers<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:08.099> are<00:02:08.520> bent

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
is twisted and our fingers are are bent

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.740 
is twisted and our fingers are are bent
in<00:02:09.450> different<00:02:10.289> manners<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:12.150> barring

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
in different manners then that barring

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.520 
in different manners then that barring
becomes<00:02:13.170> difficult<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.400> best<00:02:15.140> even<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:16.380> we're

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
becomes difficult at best even if we're

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.520 
becomes difficult at best even if we're
able<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> bar<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.420> will<00:02:18.420> see<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
able to bar you will see that so the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.830 
able to bar you will see that so the
intonation<00:02:19.800> will<00:02:20.160> suffer<00:02:20.840> quite

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
intonation will suffer quite

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.800 
intonation will suffer quite
significantly<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.910> what's<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> solution<00:02:27.420> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
significantly so what's the solution to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.670 
significantly so what's the solution to
trying<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> improve<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:31.170> probably

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
trying to improve this I think probably

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.350 
trying to improve this I think probably
the<00:02:31.980> easiest<00:02:32.310> ways<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.580> find<00:02:32.790> something

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the easiest ways to find something

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.360 
the easiest ways to find something
that's<00:02:33.510> easy<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.959> work<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.410> while

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
that's easy to work on while

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.140 
that's easy to work on while
concentrating<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.660> keeping<00:02:37.080> good<00:02:37.319> left<00:02:37.680> hand

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
concentrating on keeping good left hand

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.070 
concentrating on keeping good left hand
left-handed<00:02:39.150> position<00:02:39.540> left-handed

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
left-handed position left-handed

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.619 
left-handed position left-handed
confirmation<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.640> might<00:02:41.849> be<00:02:41.970> simple<00:02:42.300> scales

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
confirmation this might be simple scales

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.589 
confirmation this might be simple scales
or<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.160> simple<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.430> Tudor<00:02:44.940> drill<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.480> you've

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
or a simple a Tudor drill that you've

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.240 
or a simple a Tudor drill that you've
been<00:02:45.840> working<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.290> recently<00:02:46.560> or<00:02:46.860> perhaps<00:02:47.010> in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
been working on recently or perhaps in

the past

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.390 
the past
something<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.349> simple<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.860> work<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.220> so

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
something that's simple to work on so

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.150 
something that's simple to work on so
you<00:02:49.489> can<00:02:49.640> concentrate<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.750> good<00:02:51.160> position

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
you can concentrate on a good position

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.930 
you can concentrate on a good position
and<00:02:52.459> shape<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.030> left<00:02:53.239> hand<00:02:54.430> now<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:55.700> while
