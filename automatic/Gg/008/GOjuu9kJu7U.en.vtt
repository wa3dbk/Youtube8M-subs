the<00:03:13.260> first<00:03:13.590> beat<00:03:13.860> which<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.130> this

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.759 

okay<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.940> let<00:03:36.300> me<00:03:36.330> play<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> couple<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.410> chords

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
okay so let me play a couple of chords

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.460 
okay so let me play a couple of chords
so<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.750> how<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.230> sound

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
so that you can see how it can sound

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.710 
so that you can see how it can sound
okay<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:44.400> focus<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:44.849> my<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.209> hand<00:03:45.450> and

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
okay just focus on my right hand and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:04:10.070 
okay just focus on my right hand and
hear<00:03:46.050> how<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.410> changes

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.380 

and<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:12.040> bolero<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:13.500> kind<00:04:14.500> of<00:04:14.560> slow<00:04:14.890> pace

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
and a bolero is a kind of slow pace

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.000 
and a bolero is a kind of slow pace
rhythm<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:17.050> you<00:04:17.110> don't<00:04:17.350> want<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.590> do<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:17.800> real

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
rhythm so you don't want to do it real

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.840 
rhythm so you don't want to do it real
fast<00:04:18.280> though<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.270> can<00:04:19.690> use<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:20.310> later<00:04:21.310> on<00:04:21.459> for

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
fast though you can use it later on for

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.670 
fast though you can use it later on for
other<00:04:21.940> styles<00:04:22.540> you'll<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:23.020> able<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.260> play<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.590> a

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
other styles you'll be able to play it a

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:42.790 
other styles you'll be able to play it a
little<00:04:23.800> faster<00:04:24.400> like<00:04:24.580> this

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.020 

anyway<00:04:43.759> just<00:04:44.379> practice<00:04:45.379> it<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:45.860> one<00:04:46.759> block

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
anyway just practice it as one block

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.350 
anyway just practice it as one block
first<00:04:47.389> make<00:04:47.960> sure<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.259> get<00:04:48.470> your<00:04:49.129> strike<00:04:50.030> and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
mute it very well remember if it sounds

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.110 
mute it very well remember if it sounds
like<00:04:56.389> this<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.940> not<00:04:59.120> good<00:04:59.419> it<00:05:00.289> has<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.500> sound

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
like this it's not good it has to sound

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.450 
like this it's not good it has to sound
like<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.360> has<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.229> be<00:05:03.319> quick<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.220> mute

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
like this has to be quick and you mute

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.070 
like this has to be quick and you mute
it<00:05:04.610> but<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.060> don't<00:05:05.300> have<00:05:05.449> to<00:05:05.690> hit<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:05.930> real

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
it but you don't have to hit it real

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.890
