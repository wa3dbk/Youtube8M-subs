00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so we're gonna dive in and open this in

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.390 
so we're gonna dive in and open this in
Photoshop<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.179> dissect<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:04.100> this<00:00:05.100> thing

guys what's going on here okay so I'm

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.180 
guys what's going on here okay so I'm
gonna<00:00:09.990> use<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.349> tool<00:00:10.620> called<00:00:10.800> an<00:00:10.950> eyedropper

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
gonna use this tool called an eyedropper

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.100 
gonna use this tool called an eyedropper
this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> eyedropper<00:00:12.540> tool<00:00:12.750> if<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.900> don't

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
this is the eyedropper tool if you don't

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.390 
this is the eyedropper tool if you don't
know<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.440> does<00:00:13.650> basically<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
know what this does basically what it

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.550 
know what this does basically what it
does<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.790> just<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.059> picks<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.839> certain

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
does is it just just picks out a certain

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.730 
does is it just just picks out a certain
pixel<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.330> example

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
pixel so if I go here for example

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.929 
pixel so if I go here for example
hopefully<00:00:19.740> everybody<00:00:20.070> sees<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.670> white<00:00:20.910> I

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
hopefully everybody sees this as white I

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
hopefully everybody sees this as white I
don't<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:21.990> light<00:00:22.289> white

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
don't know we're like a very light white

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.950 
don't know we're like a very light white
especially<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.670> should<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:24.029> should<00:00:24.930> be

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
especially this here should be should be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.439 
especially this here should be should be
full<00:00:25.949> white<00:00:26.220> now<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> click<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.240> we'll

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
full white now if we click on this we'll

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
full white now if we click on this we'll
actually<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.320> all<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> information<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
actually can get all the information and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.229 
actually can get all the information and
we<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> value<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:33.059> not

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
we can get the value now I'm not

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
we can get the value now I'm not
necessarily<00:00:33.960> saying<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.410> people<00:00:34.739> are

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
necessarily saying what people are

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.729 
necessarily saying what people are
seeing<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:35.820> wrong<00:00:36.110> I'm<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.590> here

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
seeing is right or wrong I'm just here

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.690 
seeing is right or wrong I'm just here
to<00:00:37.860> prove<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:39.079> actual<00:00:40.079> value<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> color

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to prove the actual value of the color

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.540 
to prove the actual value of the color
of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.899> pixels<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> photo<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
of the pixels in this photo if that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.860 
of the pixels in this photo if that
makes<00:00:44.820> sense<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
makes sense and we're gonna do that

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.920 
makes sense and we're gonna do that
using<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.680> eyedropper<00:00:46.890> tool<00:00:47.719> Photoshop<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
using the eyedropper tool Photoshop the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
using the eyedropper tool Photoshop the
eyedropper<00:00:49.440> tool<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.800> computers<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.579> lie

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
eyedropper tool and computers do not lie

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.990 
eyedropper tool and computers do not lie
we<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> type<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.020> value<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.489> only<00:00:53.670> way

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
we can type in this value the only way

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
we can type in this value the only way
that<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> gonna<00:00:54.629> appear<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.320> different

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that this is gonna appear a different

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
that this is gonna appear a different
color<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.420> possibly

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
color to you is if you are possibly

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.849 
color to you is if you are possibly

I<00:00:58.890> don't<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.399> now<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> part<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
obviously this part here is gonna be

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
obviously this part here is gonna be
darker<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> shadow<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
darker because it's a shadow for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
darker because it's a shadow for
whatever<00:01:36.600> reason<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.670> still<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.210> black

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
whatever reason but it's still not black

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
let's type in this this value here in on

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.879 
let's type in this this value here in on
this<00:04:25.840> website

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
this website

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.619

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.300 
this is why some people are seeing
here's<00:05:37.089> the<00:05:37.270> shades<00:05:37.629> of<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.080> hex<00:05:38.439> value<00:05:39.129> that

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
here's the shades of that hex value that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.159 
here's the shades of that hex value that
people<00:05:39.969> were<00:05:40.060> either<00:05:40.150> seeing<00:05:40.509> gold<00:05:40.750> or<00:05:40.930> black

people were either seeing gold or black

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.679 
people were either seeing gold or black
so<00:05:41.500> here's<00:05:41.740> our<00:05:41.889> hex<00:05:42.129> value<00:05:42.550> here<00:05:43.000> now

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
so here's our hex value here now

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.779 
so here's our hex value here now
depending<00:05:44.319> on<00:05:44.439> again<00:05:45.009> the<00:05:45.129> tilt<00:05:45.399> of<00:05:45.490> your<00:05:45.550> LCD
