00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.389
 I have a little good night 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.800
 history this story is was and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.119
 actually happened to me i was 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.619
 Engaged as a moderator on one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.930
 Cruise ship and there I thought first 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.060
 time cruise super thing until I on 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.830
 drive the ship 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.220
 I realized I was wrong 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.040
 steamer and seasickness knows no 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.260
 respect of the approbation 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.219
 it was not funny finally solid ground 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.950
 under the feet 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.050
 I went to Norway and saw there 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 standing on a rock a penguin 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 and I thought what a poor one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.809
 Sausages pinguins to small wings 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.010
 stocking stature and somehow the has 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.770
 boss also have his knees 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.809
 forgot miss construction clear there 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.649
 the penguin jumped in front of my eyes 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.299
 water and swam and there I just thought 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.310
 still things are excellent swimmers 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.530
 They are so well suited in the water 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.880
 fast manoeuvrable with fun to move that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 you with the energy from a liter 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.900
 gasoline can swim 2000 km that is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 better than anything people ever did 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.490
 have built and I thought 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 Mistaken construction of the penguin recalls 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.850
 two things like speed 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.619
 Part of the cases and how I use them 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.909
 can be completely wrong when 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.210
 not people only in a situation 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.280
 have seen and the second how important 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.740
 The environment is what you can do 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.119
 people come to the fore 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.040
 do not change completely and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.509
 basically if you are a penguin 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 seven years were born 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.040
 psychotherapy out of you in this life 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.270
 little giraffe 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.800
 and there is a good therapist 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.360
 many do not last long 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.580
 want to talk about why you like it 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.870
 long neck would have something with the children 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.460
 and the loss of 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.450
 Grandfather and set that up for the first time 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.040
 no, he will ask who you are 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.110
 what can you do that you want what are 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.670
 strengthen your strengths to strengthen that way 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 Much more meaningful is its weaknesses 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.550
 doing your own 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.470
 and if they always think yes I would have to 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.770
 but be a little like the others 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.770
 consolation others are already enough 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.760
 everything that is required of us is ours 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.740
 to know and see if I am in favor 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 a good environment and if i am 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.709
 penguin am in and wished me on 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.959
 stop then it is not up to me if it is 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.620
 I do not slip just small 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.970
 to take steps 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.130
 to my water and there I have to 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.970
 then I know how that works 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.590
 It feels like being in my element 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.590
 I'm very thankful for that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.670
 always knows and I wish you 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.280
 from my heart 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.900
 i also liked being in the clinic doctor 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.459
 one of my weaknesses is but I am 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.010
 so a bit more creative caro that it 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.780
 unfavorable there 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.610
 but one of my strengths is without you 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.159
 formulate fixed text when formulating freely 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 new ideas to come is that 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.189
 dictating medical letters unfavorably 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.450
 in other words, today I use more 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.739
 my strengths strengthen my weaknesses 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.110
 club less weight and that only 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.780
 a small example of what motivates you 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 Shall get your penguin on track 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.560
 come and stay faithful and be mine 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.180
 the cheap penguin and wished them 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.180
 a lot of time in your element
