00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello how about I'm giorgio and I make 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 equal banalities and if you stay 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.240
 with me in this video before showing you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.240
 how to make this paper doll 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.760
 The first thing you will do is a little ball 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.280
 of newspaper forms the good 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.800
 round and tight 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.630
 and fasten it with paper tape in the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.940
 bottom tie a ojito places the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070
 glue and a wooden stick comes out 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.800
 to make it firmer, hold it with 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.300
 tape all around it with the help of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.840
 plasticine let's form some 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.960
 details 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.989
 I'm going to cover the face, for example I'm going 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.940
 to form a nose I'm also going to 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 form by pressing the holes a little 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.079
 for the eyes and I pass her eyebrows 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 do not forget the lips that will be the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.980
 mouth of the wrist 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.580
 and of course two balls that will be the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.050
 eyes cut out small pieces of paper 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.720
 china and with the help of a brush and 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.750
 white glue let's go upholstery 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.610
 the whole head with rooms of 4 or 5 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.010
 layers so that it is well resistant 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.410
 once it dries and when you finish 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.780
 place them place a generous layer of 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.130
 white glue so that when drying 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.960
 an even smoother texture 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 let's now start painting with 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.620
 acrylic paints I will use a tone 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.720
 brown to paint the whole head 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.910
 with the help of a pencil you will mark the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.520
 eye details the eyelids and the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.980
 pupil and with the help of acrylic paint 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.900
 black color and a thin brush we're going 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.710
 to start painting start to 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.750
 delineating and after filling 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.090
 for eyebrows and eyes I will use a 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.190
 dark brown tone look like I painted 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 the lips and the eyelids in a tone 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.350
 rose and now you put some veneers 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.200
 to form the hair we will need 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.330
 form a wig so with felt 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.940
 dark coffee I'm going to take the measure of 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.280
 the head and I'm going to cut it after 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.590
 with brown wool or with wool 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.200
 coffee color let's start forming the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.550
 hair passes the needle and pulls both 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.020
 strips cut the piece and tie a knot 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.810
 repeat the operation as many times as 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.610
 necessary for you to hang the whole piece 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.630
 of felt need not remain 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.130
 very close together 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.030
 you can give it a separation so that 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 finish faster 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.010
 once you finish upholstering all the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.690
 piece of felt you will unravel and 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.060
 you're going to brush it hard so that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.400
 strips of yarn are unraveled and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.010
 thus form the appearance of hair for 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.000
 make it easier you can even 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.700
 untangle each of the strips 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.270
 separating the two in order to later be able 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.270
 brush 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.730
 finally comb the to give it the style 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.769
 that you want with glass paint 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.300
 I'm going to put a little on the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.170
 pupils to give it an appearance 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.170
 sparkly 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.010
 and to put it more flirtatious I'm going to 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.569
 place half of a false eyelash 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.700
 in each of the eyes 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.290
 to form the body you basically have 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.999
 that follow the same procedure as 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.249
 we have done with the head for the body 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:22.010
 we will need an egg and for 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:24.019
 tips we will need 4 sticks 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.930
 You can form them with paper 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.150
 aluminum and follow the same procedure 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.370
 finally we are going to subject them with 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.079
 Wire a wire that goes through the side 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.989
 to side by an ojito that you will have to do 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.819
 when you cross the still fresh 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.340
 wire and with it you will hold each 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.870
 side each of the extremities 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.209
 forming a roll with tweezers 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.430
 pliers so that they remain subject and of 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.139
 this way have mobility the step of 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.269
 create the body and the extremities me what 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.159
 jumped because it's really the same 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.780
 procedure that the head and to 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.909
 prevent the video from being too 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.650
 too long finally and most 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.359
 fun is that you are going to create the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.159
 clothes that you want and you are going to give him your 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.599
 own style of truth I wish you 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.269
 have liked and that you put it into practice 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.280
