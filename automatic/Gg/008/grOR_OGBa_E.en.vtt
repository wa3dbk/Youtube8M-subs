00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.130

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.849

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 For this season 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.590
 we are going to need tape what you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.680
 have wide to be able to elaborate the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.540
 bow and any flower to decorate 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.660
 the center if you want to decorate it 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.910
 You can do it with a flower 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 to teach is more or less how it is made 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.720
 that kind of bun 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 we are going to double our channel forming a 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 triangle with needle and thread we are going to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.180
 start from this point 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.180
 to pass sewing 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.510
 Up to the middle 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.429
 you calculate half of the bun 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.649
 here we are going to frown and we were not going to 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.649
 give a few laps of security 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.470
 so that we do not get loose 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.890
 here we already have what is the basis of 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.690
 monkey 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.700
 let's elaborate 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.850
 with the tape that you have wide 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 which they have at hand we are going to elaborate 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 a simple basic monkey bow 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.060
 we pass the needle or can not produce 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.479
 with your fingers any of the options 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.479
 they can do it 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.179
 we produce 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.930
 we already have a very simple basic bow 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 we are going to sting the tips 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.560
 you 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.810
 let's stick it once to our 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.810
 bun made in tulle we are going to paste 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.010
 We apply silicone with one more tape 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.450
 thin let's go through the center 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.450
 to cover our thread 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.990
 our accessory is already there 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.540
 very nice very easy we apply silicone 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.970
 we are going to paste a flower that we have 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.370
 drawn on tape any design that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 you want to place them we have 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.710
 decorated with a kitten made in 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.780
 porcelain cold or by will be black but 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.090
 I will also commit it on the buttons 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.050
 a very easy option that can 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.240
 get in craft stores 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.140
 let's decorate our bun with others 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.140
 buttons 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.740
 this is how we have finished a project 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.030
 very easy very simple for this time 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.320
 We hope you liked this idea 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.320
 until a next opportunity
