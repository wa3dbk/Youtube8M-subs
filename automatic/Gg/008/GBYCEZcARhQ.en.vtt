00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hello my dear viewers with you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.469
 Roma and the channel called r on her 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.580
 Sheva today we continue to survey 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 great fashions for a great game 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 called mikroft and today 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 mod will add to our game opportunity 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 make selfi think everyone knows what it is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 so I will not explain 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.140
 so how can we do 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.880
 This is a very selfie and very simple and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.420
 understandable using a cell phone 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.940
 which is pretty cheap 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590
 but if you consider to remember that with 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 using it you can do only 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 Only one selfi then this pretty 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 justified craft 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.829
 here by the way so almost something like this 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 here he has a craft but for some reason he does not 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.660
 crafting so I just took it easy 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.699
 and up to a hundred from it is in this version of the mod he 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 not crafting but seriously make up he 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 in theory, so lately I have 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 all the mods are somehow incomprehensible 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.090
 problems well, and here we are 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.270
 we get an old chipmunk vundu on 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.030
 view and still push-button at the time nobody 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 didn't even know about this damn sylph 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 so as if everything is a little illogical 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.400
 oh well we press the right mouse button 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.650
 and voila, that's all you can do links 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 just really simple just press right 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.140
 the mouse button is something like gta 5 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 that's exactly the same angle there are selfie and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.020
 done then you press the left 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.869
 mouse button and you are told 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 write something about your selfie or 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.950
 something like that give him some 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 name you write type follow my 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.939
 brother and till may brothers or anything 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.130
 like that and just send now 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.680
 to you now I nod a network this link to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 Your selfi can go see and all 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.439
 here's a little mod here but 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.020
 This is very very relevant. 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.500
 quite an interesting way 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 share with their friends celfi ie 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.409
 not just throw screenshots namely 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.010
 some links directly from minecraft 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.930
 quite convenient interesting thing well and 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.640
 it's time to rate this mod on a scale 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.860
 on the water to drink and the diamonds I forgot this 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.780
 do with the previous year past fashion 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.740
 i give four of five diamond over this 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.420
 I probably give fashion three out of five diamonds 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.300
 Yes, because he is pretty 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 up-to-date but with this phone 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.840
 crafting is very, very important 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.280
 Then a strange picture at 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 the phone then there it is you 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.030
 throwing everything ok with him and when he 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.270
 you to the Quick Access Toolbar to 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.020
 he looks pretty weird 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.990
 it's time to throw in our loved ones 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.690
 diamond we take 5 diamonds and give it 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.840
 just she aset and not even probably 22 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.560
 diamond 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.660
 yes, well, and for relevance let it be 3 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.420
 write how much diamond do you rate this 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.940

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.740

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.870
