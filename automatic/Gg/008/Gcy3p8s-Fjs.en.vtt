00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 I think this is completely different from such a story 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.570
 Top of the world 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.230
 2 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:18.010
 Top athletes who climb up after all 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.180
 I have thought that I have the same sense this time 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.260
 that 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.260
 Seo Ji Olympics 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:31.870
 Hanyu players, is not it however really and great acting and great score or work programs 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.350
 At the time of short 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.420
 so 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.420
 Well I wonder and I thought wow there is really wonderful 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.440
 It is acting being acted though it is impressed though it is amateur of ah 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.940
 so 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.940
 Was it news zero ? 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.530
 I put it on a good trip and saw that I answered 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.620
 Just that 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.079
 About 3.1311 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.250
 a 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:11.580
 I was interviewed and Hanyu 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:11.580
 I think he is the person who grew up in a distant Sendai in 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.720
 gold medal 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.450
 That station that gave the highest score for its high score 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.380
 What kind of feeling was it in acting ? 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.750
 when entrusted 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.020
 Very 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.250
 I felt a sense of loss and helplessness 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.890
 I forgot some words when I took it, but I'm sorry 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.970
 What What What a number of stages I and eh eat saying Tatte I felt that kind of the feeling of helplessness 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.640
 right 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 But if you ask 10% 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 I 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.560
 I myself 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.480
 In doing such a performance as doing a great performance or taking a medal 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.370
 Even a little revival 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.820
 I thought if I could become the power of 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.840
 As a result, how great a strange tree I want to be 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.400
 Be appreciated from the world 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.810
 The reconstruction says Datte do not is so advanced reality 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.610
 know 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.400
 Referred to in the wind Tteyuu I felt a very attractive 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.910
 I think you're amazing what you said 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.870
 Hey hey 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.870
 I really think 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.060
 It is mini-receiving and seismic intensity 4 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.670
 Make your followers brighter 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.610
 For a while 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.970
 Forget the painful reality 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.090
 Only of the performance as it was if fleeting 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.530
 You are not doing the absolute Hanyu players 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.310
 But he himself 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 That time we have spent a great deal of time trying 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:05.720
 How to keep the feelings and support 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:12.270
 Stacking the practice in the same strong feelings to the reconstruction of say or have been supported by the kind of thought 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:16.380
 Listening to say I gave birth that kite fish really respect to I was further impressed 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.160
 Even though I was made to feel that respect for 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.350
 It looks but does not change anything 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.680
 You mentioned that 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.879
 In 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.879
 This is when there is a Well one reconstruction of that winning by it many think 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.220
 I think that it is the first thing that it was a great thing to stand and perform at that stage 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.110
 The 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.830
 No, no that in the wind that I have is the person who became a healthy'm not that such a thing 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.140
 I thought I wanted to say but I remembered one more and that one 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.100
 That remembered to watch the interview 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:56.300
 Is it 14 years ago from now at the time of Sydney Olympics 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.730
 It is 2000 2000. At that time , that Takahashi q is 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.760
 High floor sugar 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.710
 Of the next day 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 It is time taken interview calico medal 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:13.560
 Interview The next day I answered in the interview 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.770
 Maybe the city of Sydney I ran the next day 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.140
 so 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.520
 Felt is given and say What was to I became a world even today I was taking gold medal 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:29.500
 Unchanged 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:31.270
 Although this sky is blue and the city ​​is moving as usual, I was yesterday just that runner 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.490
 Today is the best in the world 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.630
 Though it became the best in the world yesterday 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.370
 But that to me is I did feel that everything has changed the world What Do I do not anything has changed 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.910
 I felt it felt strange 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.910
 Shirt yourself 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.800
 There it Is this amazing Solving what years has focused around it 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.520
 that 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.020
 Say to the performance in place of Olympics 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.960
 If you don't feel so strong 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.740
 Even if I have a strong feeling that I can not win 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.699
 Only one person who can do the best performance on that stage is losing 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.699
 Who is the person chosen ? 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.580
 I think it's amazing how exciting I was moved
