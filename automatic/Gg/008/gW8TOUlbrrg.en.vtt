00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.250
 The third shampoo is called Wikileaks 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.700
 green or something like this looks like this 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.610
 greenish full of trunks of leaflets 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.850
 and of plant extracts worth has a 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.690
 price of 7 95 like karma and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.780
 well this is to say that it is with the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.809
 only if you say the only one not 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.160
 I escaped nothing the hair was my 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.470
 third pill so it was a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.500
 surprise as it can always be because 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.960
 my hair already had practically all 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.030
 silicones either out or because casually 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.380
 Well, this pill was a luxury 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.690
 it's something that I can not tell you with 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.579
 accuracy the case is that to the test I 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.079
 I refer with this one I do not hair anything 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.410
 scalp I do not get anything discharged 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.940
 super good has and over when he puts you 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.259
 the description that concretely has 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.660
 focused to care for the scalp 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.979
 to hydrate it and so on then good 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.200
 Well, let's say that here he has done his 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.630
 effect and has nettle extracts 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.460
 rosemary tea tree and mint so 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.860
 let's say it refreshes a lot what is the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.830
 scalp and good yes I notice that 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 what nourishes it and well that is not worth 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.710
 so 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.870
 regarding the smell and that this is better 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 this pill so it does not have any 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.600
 unpleasant smell but this one smells 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.870
 to field and I could not say I'm going to field 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.360
 it smells like brush, it does not smell like something 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.670
 super nice does not smell of rosemary either 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 because the rosemary or what it smells and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.810
 it smells like mountain but I would not say that it prints 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.090
 rosemary or smell very little I do not know the same 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.190
 It smells like stinging nettle, but what does it smell like? 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.380
 Nettles by girls I never stopped was 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.970
 a nettle and mint does not come back like that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 what good for you to know is that no 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.050
 you wait for a shampoo wow what it smells 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.840
 luxury but come on it's not that it smells bad 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.700
 do not worry about knowing that when 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.610
 you know it, you let it dry 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.739
 really are the perfumes of these 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.239
 shampoos do not really stay much in 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.709
 the same hair motivates so a little bit 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.110
 more but usually it is then removed 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.480
 and the hair smells like nothing does not use it 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.790
 It's clean but it does not have perfume like that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.500
 that I like and the last shampoo that 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.660
 I've been using it for a while now 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.160
 I started another one too but as nothing 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.580
 I just recorded it a couple of times 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.950
 Well, I did not want to include it either 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.450
 in the review because well I've 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.550
 used others more so then 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 preferred to include that to make a 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.990
 selection then the next one that I've 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 used more time is this here that 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.370
 I came with the gloss box and box and it's 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.400
 the like new has a price of 7 with 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.170
 95 euros on the web and well, this one 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.880
 also puts that balances the leather 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.220
 hairy and good that goes too 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.050
 intended for those moments in which 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.590
 we have hair loss due to stress 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 for duty for various things but for 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.370
 Usually, that's why we have the hair 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.770
 weaker and good because we want to give you a 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.770
 chute of strength then it has that 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.590
 rosemary mint nettles also oils 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.540
 of cinnamon clove and laurel then I 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.700
 remember in the composition similar to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.800
 squeeze and green this that I have taught you 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.540
 before it 's just that these have more 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.150
 ingredients a little bit more complete 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.950
 done is like that and I came with a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.470
 twig that I think is cinnamon or 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.280
 of nail I do not know but 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.170
 the same is not a shampoo that smells good 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.530
 it smells super nice voucher no way sweet 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.330
 does not smell like a field to the same thing 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.610
 people say it smells a lot of cinnamon that 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.170
 pulls back but to me really I 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.300
 want to remember this smell so strong more 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.450
 that the cinnamon wants to hang me more 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.280
 Nail smell if you do not know why but 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.780
 good here the cinnamon good cinnamon 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.340
 and if not then nail but let me 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.530
 cinnamon is something that I see an ingredient 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.090
 that I like a lot and I recognize it 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.620
 right then so good considered that a 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.480
 I do not part cinnamon but good what else 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.280
 Give everyone who thinks what he wants 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.650
 case is that this field just like the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.230
 squeeze and green looks after me very well 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.020
 scalp does not peel at all 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.820
 so I'm happy I think that of the 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.000
 I'm going to repeat, they're going to be these 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.430
 two 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.220
 hair what I notice that with this 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.989
 unlike with green this yes 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.010
 that gives me more volume I'm left with 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.170
 hair as more boy more volume wanted 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.760
 say another adjective with more body with 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.440
 more weight with now because it takes a 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.290
 poet but in the end challenges me and then 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.720
 with more weight more more colorful then 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.310
 Well, now he only used this shampoo 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.930
 Well, I'm sure it's with this one because 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.280
 with the other does not happen to me so good 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.320
 I also recommend this one 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.120
 a lot if the hair is very beautiful and 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.730
 especially that usually with all 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.410
 were the hair is spic and me 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.780
 because it usually does not cost me either 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.940
 an outrage untangle melo either 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.070
 is that give me from among one way 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.630
 super easy because let's say he counted the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.000
 shampoos that I've tried now 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.940
 I consider that specifically only the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.320
 shampoo easily unravels or that 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.240
 facilitate what is the hairstyle but good 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.530
 I then put on conditioners and 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.030
 solution a little bit this topic because 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.180
 as I have drier tips because 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.509
 it always costs me lovers to train me what 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.970
 I'm happy my hair is I think more 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.820
 healthy than ever to have them so long 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.440
 I think he's very careful 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.610
 pretty and how nice that I like to look like 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.680
 What does hair do 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.240
 advent so nothing else girls if she dares 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.380
 There is still some doubt about the shampoos 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.060
 that I have taught you and want to know 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.229
 Anything more you know that I 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.940
 you can leave a comment here 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.530
 you can send an email to those who 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.210
 exist asking what lipstick do I have 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.870
 Well you know that I bought the other 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.669
 day and is one of the well-known 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.150
 kate moss lipsticks for rimmel london 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.500
 and well I had heard a lot 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.169
 these lipsticks are easy to find 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.729
 they are in mercadona to start and good 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.250
 the all I wear is the feel good 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.780
 it's a matte bar but let's not say 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.690
 are these mate who has a 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.810
 hyper total coverage is a road 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.889
 matte but it is not opaque on the other hand 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.210
 it does not have the same duration as 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.250
 example a matte lipstick as what 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.349
 We know about the sea ​​but he has good 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.360
 counterpart that does not dry out the lip 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.979
 as much as that is so good for 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.840
 tastes colors the price I do not remember 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.759
 so I can not say it because the 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.440
 ticket has it but let's go more or 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.820
 less affordable 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.430
 more girl remember that you can follow me 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.960
 by facebook twitter and instagram and what 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.910
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.330
 video and that we see ourselves very soon in the 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.330
 next
