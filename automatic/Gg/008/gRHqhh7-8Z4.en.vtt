00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 in fact for four years 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.350
 Rusanovsky car market 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
 summer always lacks 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.660
 Buyers first of all it is connected 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.570
 with the tourist period many people 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.070
 go on holiday 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.150
 rest someone engaged in tourist 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.619
 business and economic activity 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 at all 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.420
 declining 17 that this year it's still 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 coincided with the fact that 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 enforced restrictions from 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.350
 Azerbaijan and maybe someone from 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 businessmen have the feeling that between 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.160
 this is actually some kind of connection 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.320
 there is no connection here it is just 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 coincidence of circumstances we expect that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.270
 closer to autumn when always in october 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 November 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 economic activity rises 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.510
 precisely in terms of car purchases 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.730
 The situation is of course equalized. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.190
 concerns from those people who are now on 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 car market 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 lacking in buyers 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 Of course, this situation was always and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.129
 need to understand that this is a market 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.619
 economy when the market was 100 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.780
 sellers and each of them sold for 10 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.150
 cars had one situation when on 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 market 1000 sellers and each one 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.960
 wants to sell your car 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.330
 you create a competitive environment in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 which survives the strongest is the market 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.259
 economy and every entrepreneur 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 who come to Rostotsky car market 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.659
 do business he must understand that his 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 business is connected with risk it can 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.140
 make money he may lose these 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.479
 money and everyone should 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.930
 make decisions agree to risk or 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.090
 no there was no such year so that someone would not 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.430
 complained then complained that they left 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.670
 representatives of kazakhstan citizens 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.260
 who bought the car and then 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.040
 reduced demand from citizens 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.590
 armenia 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.080
 it always happens that people don't 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.509
 like it because when you are around 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.240
 man he sells the car you do not 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.190
 buys you it seems that some 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.550
 injustice is a market economy 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.860
 what happened now now 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.810
 Azerbaijanis significantly reduced prices 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.570
 Georgian market at the moment is not yet 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 responded to this decline and 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.350
 at the moment we have not 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.430
 competitive advantage over 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.910
 which prices are already now baku but with 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.840
 over time, the demand should equalize 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.040
 price offer 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.230
 I think the price will change in Georgia and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.230
 in America and Japan due to the fact that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.730
 first of all, this is a limitation of banks 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.860
 which are now greatly enhanced 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.290
 lending requirements 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.270
 by car if before a man 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.830
 wanting to buy a car on credit 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.960
 could 20-30 percent of the original installment 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.150
 deposit and receive the remaining amount 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.640
 loan now in some banks 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.860
 down payment has passed for 60 70 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.420
 percent and the ability of people to buy 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.230
 cars on credit dropped significantly 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.180
 that the market immediately responded 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.370
 responded by reducing demand 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.330
 when demand falls for some time 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.320
 happens 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.950
 market adjustment or should decrease 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.540
 offer or even two months price 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.780
 time will put everything in its place 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.750
 market economy which in which 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.220
 my mind does not need to actively intervene 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 the government creates the rules of the game for 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.430
 exact comfortable set 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.670
 taxation 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.620
 and customs excise taxes after that each 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.810
 market participant himself defines his play 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.420
 by these rules or not if he accepted 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.330
 These rules mean he is aware 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.160
 that once he will win by car when 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.500
 then lose 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.190
 it means now such a moment when someone 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.320
 loses 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.930
 maybe tomorrow is the moment he 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.250
 will win this business to them nowhere else 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.390
 buy cars anyway 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.610
 Azerbaijan imports its cars 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.970
 country another question what cars 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.580
 Azerbaijani citizens will buy 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.100
 can as many cars as before 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.530
 Can Azerbaijani citizens be able to buy ? 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.180
 buy in the same volume I thought in 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.790
 quantitative expression the figure is 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.520
 will change if previously bought is admissible 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.890
 4 thousand cars now 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.720
 there will be a figure of 2 and a half three thousand 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.830
 cars but these cars will be by 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.020
 price is more expensive and in terms of money 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.210
 trade between georgia and 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.710
 Azeri I think sooner or later 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.800
 will reach the previous level or even 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.220
 will get bigger here 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.340
 this month is an approximate amount 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.879
 re-export 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.620
 export between georgia and azerbaijan i 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.840
 I can say that for four 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.270
 years this figure has constantly grown but if 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.659
 taking summer periods for example june and 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.599
 July 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.479
 then every year this figure filed I can 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:06.199
 say that now is still quite a lot 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.690
 there have been buyers a month when we are ours 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.210
 partners complained what to buy at all 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.340
 or not the eleventh twelfth year in 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.319
 same time around three four thousand 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.919
 Mary exported precisely with our 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:28.930
 car market 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:28.930
 monthly please i can 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.370
 see imagine you 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.690
 but look really like 4 years 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.310
 work trosovskiy car market on 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.580
 four years from the fifth year already 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:01.330
 in fact often turn off the sound 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.330
 something urgent 1 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.090
 not 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:35.370
 all key sound u okay some 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:39.650
 T-shirts questions and tasks more than I know 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.650
 but I'm about the situation
