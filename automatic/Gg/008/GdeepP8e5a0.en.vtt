thing<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.079> box<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.559> did<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.010> year<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
thing that box we did this year was

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.860 
thing that box we did this year was
include<00:00:59.760> these<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> curved

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
include these kind of curved

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
include these kind of curved
indentations<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.280> each<00:01:02.489> each<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
indentations on all each each of the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.539 
indentations on all each each of the
keys<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.400> because

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
keys I like this very much just because

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
keys I like this very much just because
you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.119> actually<00:01:06.240> feel<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> keys<00:01:06.869> better

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you can actually feel the keys better

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
you can actually feel the keys better
and<00:01:07.380> does<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> make<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.430> kind<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and does it make you kind of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.830 
and does it make you kind of
second-guess<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.510> pressing<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
second-guess when you're pressing a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
second-guess when you're pressing a
button<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.439> definitely<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> nice<00:01:10.950> little

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
button so it's definitely a nice little

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.980 
button so it's definitely a nice little
design<00:01:11.790> improvement<00:01:12.299> over<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> last<00:01:12.630> few

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
design improvement over the last few

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
design improvement over the last few
model<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.650> install<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
model so to install this on to the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
model so to install this on to the
iPhones<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.509> pretty<00:01:15.869> simple<00:01:16.290> snap-on<00:01:16.710> saw

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
iPhones it's pretty simple snap-on saw

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.820 
iPhones it's pretty simple snap-on saw
case<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> go<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.240> first

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
case actually I go the other way first

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
case actually I go the other way first
just<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.189> there's<00:01:20.549> no<00:01:20.700> actual<00:01:21.150> button

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
just because there's no actual button

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
just because there's no actual button
covers<00:01:21.799> since<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> longest<00:01:23.610> side

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
covers since that is the longest side

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.580 
covers since that is the longest side
that<00:01:24.119> covers<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> iPhone<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.290> should

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that covers the iPhone and it should

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.580 
that covers the iPhone and it should
just<00:01:25.740> snap<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.220> place<00:01:26.840> like<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.439> nice

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
just snap into place like so it's a nice

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
just snap into place like so it's a nice
subtle<00:01:28.829> snap<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.119> that's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
subtle snap there but it is that's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.819 
subtle snap there but it is that's
pretty<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.380> ready<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.710> go

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
pretty much it and you're ready to go

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
pretty much it and you're ready to go
the<00:01:32.220> power<00:01:32.460> button<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.970> until<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> light

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the power button here until the light

the keyboard here this is just going to

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:24.550 
the keyboard here this is just going to
be<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.840> quick<00:03:14.660> test<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.870> box<00:03:20.750> way<00:03:22.880> blue

tooth keyboard all right so my typing
there<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.459> extremely<00:03:30.180> slow<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.079> any

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
there was extremely slow but like any

mentioned earlier is these current in

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.259 
mentioned earlier is these current in
tentationem<00:03:49.370> sin<00:03:50.370> terms<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.790> typing<00:03:51.150> just

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269
