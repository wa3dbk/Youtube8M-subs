00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
throw over just L to encircle right

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.530 
throw over just L to encircle right
after<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.010> pick<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> pitch<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.730> hit<00:00:08.880> L<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.210> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
after you pick a pitch you hit L to and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.709 
after you pick a pitch you hit L to and
circle<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.110> throws<00:00:10.320> over<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> first<00:00:11.719> same

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
circle and it throws over to first same

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.360 
circle and it throws over to first same
thing<00:00:12.990> will<00:00:13.139> go<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> different<00:00:13.860> way<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.190> so

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
thing will go in a different way here so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.029 
thing will go in a different way here so
pick<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:14.610> pitch<00:00:14.940> we've<00:00:15.719> picked<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.049> fastball

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
pick your pitch we've picked a fastball

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.640 
pick your pitch we've picked a fastball
or<00:00:17.130> whatever<00:00:17.369> then<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.060> hit<00:00:18.180> L<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.170> then

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
or whatever then we hit L one and then

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.080 
or whatever then we hit L one and then
circle<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> throw<00:00:20.369> over<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> get<00:00:20.970> this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
circle a throw over and you get this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.490 
circle a throw over and you get this
like<00:00:21.300> step<00:00:21.660> off<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.109> rubber<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:24.230> not<00:00:25.230> really

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
like step off the rubber look not really

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.960 
like step off the rubber look not really
effective<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:25.980> picking<00:00:26.279> them<00:00:26.400> off<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.820> at

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
effective at picking them off but at

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
effective at picking them off but at
least<00:00:27.210> throws<00:00:27.599> off<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> timing<00:00:28.039> there's<00:00:29.039> also

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
least throws off the timing there's also

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120 
least throws off the timing there's also
kind<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.880> tricky<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.260> hit<00:00:31.650> L<00:00:31.859> one

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
kind of a tricky one which you hit L one

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.010 
kind of a tricky one which you hit L one
in<00:00:32.279> circle<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.910> intentional<00:00:33.450> pass<00:00:33.510> which

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
in circle for the intentional pass which

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
in circle for the intentional pass which
that's<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.500> looks<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
that's what this looks like but then you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.319 
that's what this looks like but then you
hit<00:00:36.000> L<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.690> circle<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> throw<00:00:37.410> over<00:00:38.329> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
hit L to in circle to throw over and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
hit L to in circle to throw over and
that's<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> also<00:00:40.290> abort<00:00:40.590> an

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that's one way to also abort an

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470 
that's one way to also abort an
intentional<00:00:41.340> pass<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.820> accidentally<00:00:42.360> hit

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
intentional pass if you accidentally hit

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.240 
intentional pass if you accidentally hit
those<00:00:42.690> buttons<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> talk<00:00:44.129> about

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
those buttons but I want to talk about

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.459 
those buttons but I want to talk about
the<00:00:44.430> slide<00:00:44.730> step<00:00:45.059> which<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.200> throw

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the slide step which you actually throw

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.470 
the slide step which you actually throw
a<00:00:46.500> pitch<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.700> also<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> throw

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
a pitch but you're also going to throw

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
a pitch but you're also going to throw
off<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> timing<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> pick

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
off the timing you're not going to pick

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
off the timing you're not going to pick
your<00:00:50.219> leg<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.700> high<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> pitcher<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.629> pick

your pitch hold our two and then hit X
as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.170> throw<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> pitch<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.920> hold<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.340> our

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
- the whole time and then we're hitting

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
- the whole time and then we're hitting
triangle<00:00:59.879> at<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> second<00:01:00.359> base<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.680> how

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
triangle at a second base and that's how

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.139 
triangle at a second base and that's how
I'll<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> done<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.090> to

I'll get it done so we're going to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.369 
I'll get it done so we're going to
notice<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.809> run<00:01:04.049> through<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
notice we're gonna run through this a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
notice we're gonna run through this a
few<00:01:04.470> times<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.640> you'll<00:01:05.790> notice<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.360> the

few times what you'll notice is the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.590 
few times what you'll notice is the
pitchers<00:01:06.960> leg<00:01:07.290> his<00:01:08.040> left<00:01:08.369> leg<00:01:08.610> does<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.180> kick

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
pitchers leg his left leg does not kick

pitchers leg his left leg does not kick
all<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> slide<00:01:10.979> step<00:01:11.220> he<00:01:11.490> kind

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
all the way up it's a slide step he kind

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
all the way up it's a slide step he kind
of<00:01:11.729> slides<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.450> left<00:01:12.689> foot<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.380> then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
of slides with that left foot and then

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.050 
of slides with that left foot and then
we<00:01:13.710> got<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.040> nice<00:01:14.220> throw<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> best

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
we got a really nice throw with the best

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
we got a really nice throw with the best
catcher<00:01:15.299> defensively<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> game<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
catcher defensively in the game and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.880 
catcher defensively in the game and
Molina<00:01:17.369> did<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.570> his<00:01:18.810> his<00:01:19.350> left<00:01:19.680> knee

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
Molina did you see how his his left knee

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.820 
Molina did you see how his his left knee
never<00:01:20.640> comes<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.210> high<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
never comes up very high it just it's a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.429 
never comes up very high it just it's a
slide<00:01:23.100> step<00:01:23.400> slide<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.390> compared<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
slide step slide kind of compared to you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.840 
slide step slide kind of compared to you
this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> normal<00:01:26.369> pitch<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.700> look

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this is what a normal pitch would look

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
this is what a normal pitch would look
like<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> rubber<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:27.840> how<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> knee

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like on the rubber you see how the knee

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
like on the rubber you see how the knee
comes<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.189> knee<00:01:29.610> comes<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> way

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
comes up that knee comes up all the way

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.530 
comes up that knee comes up all the way
the<00:01:30.900> lead<00:01:31.110> knee<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.479> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the lead knee and that would be not a
