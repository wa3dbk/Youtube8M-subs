00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it's actually pretty amazing in my

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.719 
it's actually pretty amazing in my
opinion<00:02:06.620> where<00:02:07.620> this<00:02:07.770> thing<00:02:07.980> really<00:02:08.280> shines

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
opinion where this thing really shines

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.910 
opinion where this thing really shines
though<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.540> you<00:02:09.660> get<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> creek<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.500> mean

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
though is when you get a creek I mean

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
though is when you get a creek I mean
you're<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.550> massive<00:02:12.090> fire<00:02:12.360> rate

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
you're going to have massive fire rate

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.210 
you're going to have massive fire rate
when<00:02:12.900> you're<00:02:13.110> getting<00:02:13.320> two<00:02:13.500> hundred<00:02:13.770> thousand

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
when you're getting two hundred thousand

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.300 
when you're getting two hundred thousand
damage<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:15.150> each<00:02:15.420> shot<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.170> mean<00:02:16.620> that's<00:02:16.950> going

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
damage on each shot I mean that's going

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300 
damage on each shot I mean that's going
to<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.580> really<00:02:18.300> kill<00:02:19.260> things<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> game

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to like really kill things in this game

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
and you'll see here later in a little

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.950 
and you'll see here later in a little
bit<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.700> are<00:02:23.850> going<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:24.240> absolutely

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
bit that we are going to like absolutely

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.680 
bit that we are going to like absolutely
decimate<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:26.370> an<00:02:26.520> ultimate<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.270> super

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690

badass enemy it's gonna be kind of cool
but<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.560> disadvantage<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.580> thing

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
but the one disadvantage of this thing

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.410 
but the one disadvantage of this thing
is<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.660> are<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.170> fast<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.270> out

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
is if I are so fast and it's kind of out

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.020 
is if I are so fast and it's kind of out
of<00:02:36.450> control<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.650> point<00:02:38.040> where<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.640> mean

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
of control to the point where I mean

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.060 
of control to the point where I mean
you'll<00:02:39.450> fire<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.990> middle<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:40.650> shoot

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.880 
you'll fire it middle just like shoot
all<00:02:41.250> over<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.670> place<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.180> its<00:02:42.720> really<00:02:43.170> tough
