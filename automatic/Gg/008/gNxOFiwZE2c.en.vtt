what<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.860> confident

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
what we need to do that I'm confident

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.650 
what we need to do that I'm confident
that<00:01:20.460> over<00:01:20.820> time<00:01:21.000> we're<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> come<00:01:21.540> back

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
that over time we're going to come back

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.460 
that over time we're going to come back
stronger<00:01:22.110> than<00:01:22.140> before<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.720> but<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> first

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
stronger than before but but but I first

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
stronger than before but but but I first
of<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.100> important<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:27.390> realize

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
of all I think it's important to realize

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
of all I think it's important to realize
that<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.770> actually<00:01:28.920> black<00:01:29.399> before<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that I was actually black before the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.220 
that I was actually black before the
election

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.010 

this<00:01:39.680> is<00:01:39.890> proof<00:01:40.750> how

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
this is proof how

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.899 
this is proof how
and<00:01:42.439> I'll<00:01:42.619> never<00:01:42.799> have<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.280> been<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> black<00:01:43.759> man

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
and I'll never have you been a black man

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.709 
and I'll never have you been a black man
and<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.719> American<00:01:46.899> people<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:48.249> think<00:01:48.999> gave

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
and so the American people I think gave

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.349 
and so the American people I think gave
me<00:01:49.869> this<00:01:50.020> extraordinary<00:01:50.439> honor<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.670> that

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
me this extraordinary honor and that

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.469 
me this extraordinary honor and that
tells<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.310> lot<00:01:54.520> about<00:01:54.640> where<00:01:55.359> the

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
tells you I think a lot about where the

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.889 
tells you I think a lot about where the
country<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.840> at<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.950> actually<00:01:57.850> think<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.569> that

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
country is at I actually think that that

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.209 
country is at I actually think that that
what's<00:01:59.170> happened<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.740> that<00:02:00.359> whenever<00:02:01.359> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
what's happened is that whenever a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.870 
what's happened is that whenever a
president<00:02:03.219> tries<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.579> bring<00:02:03.729> about

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
president tries to bring about

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.480 
president tries to bring about
significant<00:02:04.750> changes<00:02:05.219> particularly<00:02:06.219> during

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
significant changes particularly during

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.839 
significant changes particularly during
times<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:06.909> economic<00:02:07.060> unease<00:02:07.719> then<00:02:08.709> there<00:02:09.549> is<00:02:09.580> a

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
times of economic unease then there is a

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.850 
times of economic unease then there is a
certain<00:02:10.629> segment<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> population<00:02:11.620> that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
certain segment of the population that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.140 
certain segment of the population that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
gets very riled up all them out after

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.759 
gets very riled up all them out after
the<00:02:16.299> fact<00:02:16.540> because<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:17.140> couldn't<00:02:17.349> afford<00:02:17.470> the
