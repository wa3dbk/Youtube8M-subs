like that
directions<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.849> never<00:02:37.060> liked<00:02:37.239> using

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
directions I never liked using

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.420 
directions I never liked using
directions<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.410> find<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.069> figure<00:02:39.310> out

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
directions I like to find and figure out

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.009 
directions I like to find and figure out
stuff<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:39.819> myself<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.360> makes<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.629> more<00:02:40.750> fun

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
stuff for myself and makes it more fun

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.180 
stuff for myself and makes it more fun
uh<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.540> guess<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.080> just<00:02:44.349> slide<00:02:45.010> as

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
uh so you guess you just slide as

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.880 
uh so you guess you just slide as
forward<00:02:45.670> I'm<00:02:46.599> safe<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.080> yeah<00:02:47.379> it<00:02:47.500> comes<00:02:47.650> out

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
forward I'm safe it yeah it comes out

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.290 
forward I'm safe it yeah it comes out
yeah<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.519> course<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.819> comes<00:02:48.940> out<00:02:49.180> because

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
yeah of course it comes out because

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.229 
yeah of course it comes out because
you've<00:02:49.510> got<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> option<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.590> change<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.180> it

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
you've got a option to change it and it

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.780 
you've got a option to change it and it
has<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.260> ports<00:02:53.560> right<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:53.739> for<00:02:54.280> guess

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
has the ports right here for guess

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.100 
has the ports right here for guess
whatever<00:02:55.030> way<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.390> want<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.720> put<00:02:55.840> your<00:02:55.959> phone

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
whatever way you want to put your phone

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110 
whatever way you want to put your phone
and<00:02:56.290> film<00:02:56.410> put<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.620> upside<00:02:56.860> down<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.310> some<00:02:57.489> odd

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
and film put it upside down for some odd

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.589 
and film put it upside down for some odd
reason<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:59.190> set<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.280> ports<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.670> both<00:03:00.700> side

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
reason you can set of ports on both side

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.559 
reason you can set of ports on both side
for<00:03:01.930> speakers<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.970> guess<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.330> would<00:03:04.450> just

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
for speakers so I guess you would just

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.280 
for speakers so I guess you would just
slide<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:05.019> in<00:03:05.080> like<00:03:05.140> that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
slide it in like that

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.710 
slide it in like that
and<00:03:08.290> then<00:03:10.950> snap<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.130> right<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.579> down<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:15.720> that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
and then snap it right on down like that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.380 
and then snap it right on down like that
don't<00:03:16.959> feel<00:03:17.170> too<00:03:17.440> right<00:03:17.910> hold<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.030> let<00:03:19.150> me<00:03:19.180> try

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
don't feel too right hold on let me try

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.759 
don't feel too right hold on let me try
this<00:03:21.690> I'm<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.780> genius<00:03:23.140> with<00:03:23.319> figuring<00:03:23.650> things

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
this I'm a genius with figuring things

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there dude you can't beat it for five

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:13.670 
there dude you can't beat it for five
hours<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:06.030> let's<00:04:07.030> see<00:04:07.150> what<00:04:07.269> we<00:04:07.329> can<00:04:07.480> do<00:04:07.599> here

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.159 

you<00:04:14.280> hear<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.609> sound<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:15.480> actually<00:04:15.810> felt<00:04:16.019> it

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
you hear that sound it actually felt it

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.310 
you hear that sound it actually felt it
sounds<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:16.859> more<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.430> base<00:04:18.320> listener

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
sounds like it's more of a base listener

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.099 
sounds like it's more of a base listener
that<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:20.419> don't<00:04:21.419> even<00:04:21.509> know<00:04:21.660> if<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.810> have<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.019> all

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
that I don't even know if I have it all

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.710 
that I don't even know if I have it all
the<00:04:22.199> way<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:23.610> sounds<00:04:23.940> more<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.419> like<00:04:24.690> a

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
the way up but it sounds more of like a

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.420 
the way up but it sounds more of like a
base<00:04:25.080> type<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.740> guess<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.100> because<00:04:26.190> it's

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
base type I guess it's because it's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.860 
base type I guess it's because it's
inside<00:04:27.680> like<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> box<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.910> closing<00:04:30.479> for<00:04:30.720> it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
inside like a box and closing for it

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.629 
inside like a box and closing for it
speaker<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> don't<00:04:31.680> know<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.860> don't<00:04:31.979> know<00:04:32.130> but<00:04:32.400> it

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
speaker I don't know I don't know but it

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.070 
speaker I don't know I don't know but it
sounded<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.060> seems<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.449> me<00:04:33.539> like<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.840> sounds<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
sounded it seems to me like it sounds a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.719 
sounded it seems to me like it sounds a
little<00:04:34.169> bit<00:04:34.320> better

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
little bit better

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.360 
little bit better
yeah<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.900> just<00:04:37.080> found<00:04:37.259> that<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.919> feels<00:04:38.130> really

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
yeah it just found that it feels really

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.700 
yeah it just found that it feels really
good<00:04:38.610> in<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.880> hand<00:04:39.090> it's<00:04:39.780> nice<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.199> quiet<00:04:40.289> it's

good in a hand it's nice and quiet it's

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.629 
good in a hand it's nice and quiet it's
tight<00:04:41.009> it<00:04:41.340> feels<00:04:41.400> good<00:04:41.850> it's<00:04:42.539> not<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.840> heavy

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
tight it feels good it's not that heavy

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.350 
tight it feels good it's not that heavy
you<00:04:44.639> know<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.490> say<00:04:47.639> man<00:04:47.820> five<00:04:48.060> hours
