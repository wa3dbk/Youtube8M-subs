pretty good original condition what also

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.020 
pretty good original condition what also
makes<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.229> unique<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.009> silver<00:02:11.730> leather

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
makes it unique is it's silver leather

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
the matter is the dust is what ended up

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.140 
the matter is the dust is what ended up
preventing<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.950> paint<00:02:27.280> from<00:02:27.460> being<00:02:27.760> ruined

preventing the paint from being ruined

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.850 
preventing the paint from being ruined
so<00:02:28.330> when<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.690> start<00:02:28.960> washing<00:02:29.320> these<00:02:29.410> off<00:02:29.650> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
so when we start washing these off and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.890 
so when we start washing these off and
cleaning<00:02:30.070> them<00:02:30.280> with<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.060> best<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.390> solution

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
cleaning them with this best of solution

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
cleaning them with this best of solution
the<00:02:32.590> paint<00:02:32.890> on<00:02:33.040> almost<00:02:33.280> all<00:02:33.490> them<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.300> in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the paint on almost all them is in is in

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.420 
the paint on almost all them is in is in
perfect<00:02:35.080> condition<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.650> that's<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.250> was<00:02:36.400> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
perfect condition so that's that was a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.980 
perfect condition so that's that was a
pleasant<00:02:36.820> surprise<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.450> when<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.660> started
