I do enjoy carrying it I enjoy carrying
this<00:04:33.370> more<00:04:33.669> than<00:04:34.029> the<00:04:34.180> skeletal<00:04:36.090> just<00:04:37.090> because

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
this more than the skeletal just because

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.890 
this more than the skeletal just because
it's<00:04:37.870> easier<00:04:38.370> other<00:04:39.370> than<00:04:39.669> that<00:04:39.849> you<00:04:40.180> know<00:04:40.210> you

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
it's easier other than that you know you

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.890 
it's easier other than that you know you
do<00:04:41.169> feel<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.400> blast<00:04:42.699> on<00:04:43.210> your<00:04:43.449> hip<00:04:43.659> when

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
do feel the blast on your hip when

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.209 
do feel the blast on your hip when
you're<00:04:44.020> carrying<00:04:44.259> it<00:04:44.409> in<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.650> case<00:04:44.830> just

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
you're carrying it in the case just

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.179 
you're carrying it in the case just
because<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.759> additional<00:04:46.719> length<00:04:47.189> the

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.189 
because of this additional length the

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.040 
because of this additional length the
weight<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.460> didn't<00:04:48.969> think<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.330> an<00:04:49.509> issue<00:04:49.659> I

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
weight I didn't think is an issue I

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.360 
weight I didn't think is an issue I
think<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:50.469> length<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.889> goes<00:04:51.009> a<00:04:51.039> little<00:04:51.279> bit

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
think is the length it goes a little bit
