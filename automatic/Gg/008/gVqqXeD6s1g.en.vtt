 for a small dessert or a small 4 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.620
 hours for kids a nice thing a 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.070

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.530
 so need some apples a little 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.789
 quickly restore the recipe according to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.560
 future of bananas dried bananas 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.270
 so that one rehydrates in some 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.630
 orange juice with a little bit of a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.640
 little vanilla shake that we're going 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.149
 scratch and a little bit of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.880
 ginger 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.040
 then you spend that blender a 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.329
 a little bit of lemon if a whole 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.950
 little bit of lemon juice just a 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.510
 teaspoon one teaspoon 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.340
 it's enough you pass that blender you 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.540
 put some taxes and that gives you 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.280
 so a banana writing slightly 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.140
 scented with vanilla with ginger and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.059
 it's a delight and so we'll have 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.490
 need cinnamon and apples 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.830
 we will work with 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.010
 our mandolin you will see and the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.010
 dehydrator it's super simple so 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.410
 I grab my apples I washed them hop 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 I do not remove the middle so here 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.760
 you see this flawless thickness that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.540
 must do that is about 2 mm 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.000
 always security 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.000
 when you use the mandolin 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.970
 so now that we have prepared 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.750
 our trays of 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.730
 of apples we will prepare the bananas 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.730
 you will see what we will do with 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.520
 so we will start with two bananas 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.800
 that we will cut to have tastes 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.380
 different we will put a puck 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.380
 of bananas in the middle of each apple 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.050
 maybe cinnamon I find it I 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.350
 find super good super fragrant so little 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:24.070
 cinnamon on our apples deceitful people 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.970
 for the vibrators the second series neither 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:32.980
 I'm going to put a little pot of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 jam so bananas 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.890
 I'm going to make mango sweets and 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.580
 I cut big cubes 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.860
 a nice sweet that's cut the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.959
 Cubans a little big because it's okay 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.459
 dehydrated so on the outside that goes 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.670
 to dry outside it will stay 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.690
 soft inside and that's it 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:05.120
 like children so I love you 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.970
 put it back to the dehydrator then 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.769
 this is the dehydrator combo sedona 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.739
 combo that has the advantage of being able to be 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.540
 programmed so you can decide to 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.750
 make your first hour at 60 degrees 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.640
 for example and the following at 45 degrees the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.110
 rocking will be done automatically this 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.110
 which is really handy 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:34.140

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.350
