00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.570
 [Music] 

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.810
 Built in the 60s and 70s 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.740
 porsche ware turbo monster 800 ps were 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.050
 No rarity 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.230
 One of them is this Porsche 935 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.750
 basically a 911 turbo with extended 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.080
 Body rigid axle and power without 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.080
 The End 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.440
 [Music] 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.050
 that would be like me this car was just 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.000
 once at a ton therefore also the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.800
 breathtaking top speed of 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.960
 over 360 km h 35 years ago the absolute 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.170
 madness 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.780
 [Music] 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.839
 And that's exactly what a car is on 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.490
 away to matthias the porsche 935 the 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:52.499
 driver on site 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.499
 [Music] 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.710
 so now have an audition at 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 autopapst walter röhrl age administrator 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.000
 Walter is one of the most outstanding 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.110
 personalities of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.090
 motorsport history 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.370
 his greatest successes celebrated the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.890
 two -time world rally champion in the 80s 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.540
 years next to porsche with fiat opel and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.069
 audi 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.069
 [Music] 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.079
 the service matthias first bow 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.600
 the choir has that is in the principle of 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.509
 grandfather of the blue higher 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.549
 Grandpa Blue is but that's it 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.049
 right bite that's right that meant 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.209
 At the time, that was 76 77 das 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.890
 Those were the cars for the men 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.770
 and me for the female re so that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.200
 was has to do something right as well 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 Of course today for me still has 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.099
 it's a flyer and a charisma that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.140
 What we do against the main criticism when I am 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.340
 sitting in the car further than we did then 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.689
 Race like we are the setup 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.489
 from the car so I see that 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.989
 unbelievable house from outside but the 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.819
 Of course, technology was much more interesting 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:10.220
 or yes of course there you have 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.329
 Of course, all registers have been pulled 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.060
 you are also attracted by the car 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.160
 Immediately the car has so -called flat 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 snout so the discs we expire 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.690
 way to make front aerodynamics cheap 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.959
 he has the big wings on it 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.299
 front contact pressure gets and is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.100
 must of course in order to preserve the balance 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.590
 Of course, in the back also in large wings 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.269
 on it as he with a wide 20 cm 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.489
 it starts of course that has behind 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.349
 Giant mature on the rear axle quite 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.299
 What is special is a start durchtrieb 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.220
 So no differential that is the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.319
 Both wheels can only be equal 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.359
 fast turn which, of course, in tight 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.819
 Curves is easy to define 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.530
 Of course, the long depends on that 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.750
 the car is more stable aerodynamics 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.669
 is cheaper and so the production car 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.680
 would actually again exactly 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.450
 you see, you will also be the wheelbase for a longer time 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
 is the same it is just just through 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.660
 the body has been lengthened 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.669
 at that time we had 800 ps because they were 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.859
 imagine is the sum of all went there 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.989
 of course, four gears so forward 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.780
 was basically a monster and you have to 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.370
 really be awake the first time 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.829
 Method is always under control 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.349
 is therefore no one has to buben 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.500
 So there we are already one today 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.120
 significant gaps happy position so 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.319
 The man can drive and I want to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.900
 now have a little lesson 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.069
 I enjoy the new turbo 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.260
 all right 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.480
 probably the first time that matthias 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.790
 without complaining to the passenger seat 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.329
 but also sets matthias first here 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.329
 office action 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.390
 Let's show the border area 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.390
 we do not 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.220
 The important thing is always the must 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:59.379
 be the slowest point and then outside 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.379
 [Music] 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.080
 for me is a car as well 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.510
 body part of the thinking must do that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.850
 I want that has to date the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.040
 not and that's the motivation why 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.560
 I drive or not fun at the car 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.000
 drive 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.590
 I only when I have the feeling I am 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.560
 always the boss of the author makes him 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.389
 said what I want 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.130
 walter has these uplifting words 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.180
 Röhrl still an anecdote from his 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.600
 Youth in stock 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.080
 [Applause] 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.580
 when I was the fresh breath with 18 there 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.850
 I'm doing the catholic church in 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.790
 the district administration and we had in 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.760
 the 200c that this as a service car 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.320
 our athletic does not meet 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.160
 absence 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.950
 I think so , though 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.720
 learned as clean as possible to drive the 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.230
 system always in swing is the loud 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.550
 against maybe 45 at the time and it 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.710
 My goal is to team as possible 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.630
 take away gas take out there I am 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.860
 very soft and rides first already 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.290
 let me keep going 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.560
 and second, that my boss is the lawyer 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.880
 I did not realize that I was so fast 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.680
 so that she was so very soft and if 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.930
 you came away then was 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.330
 Of course it was very scary 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.710
 was very far 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.570
 if once really a gen comt far 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.910
 away then I could already be on 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.710
 the x has flashed that he has walter 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:28.340
 why did I know flashing 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.950
 in the internal service in the internal service read 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:42.300
 I tell you one of the walter child everyone 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:44.150
 second in bavaria also in matthias 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.920
 rather sit on the driver's side 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.540
 copied from a rally legend 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.250
 will be compensated for some in the walter 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.470
 Röhrl that of course it was really 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.550
 an absolute honor because the man is the 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.750
 As far as car driving is concerned, and 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.120
 that now very quiet next to it and 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.120
 just enjoy and enjoy
