hose you've seen these you've probably

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.209 
hose you've seen these you've probably
purchased<00:00:42.329> five<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.719> six<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> these<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.530> year

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
purchased five or six of these a year

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.010 
purchased five or six of these a year
probably<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> fact<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.750> they're

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
probably because the fact that they're

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
probably because the fact that they're
fairly<00:00:46.920> inexpensively<00:00:47.640> made<00:00:47.969> made<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.420> of

fairly inexpensively made made out of
cheap<00:00:48.780> plastic<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> hose<00:00:50.370> clamp

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
cheap plastic they have a hose clamp

attached<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> fitting<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.829> basically

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
attached to a fitting that basically

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549 
attached to a fitting that basically
attaches<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> bayonet<00:00:54.600> fitting<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
attaches to the bayonet fitting and then

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
attaches to the bayonet fitting and then
you<00:00:55.680> open<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.160> dump<00:00:56.399> valve<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.969> you're<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you open your dump valve and you're you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
you open your dump valve and you're you
evacuate<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> tanks<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> issues

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
evacuate the tanks one of the issues

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.220 
evacuate the tanks one of the issues
with<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> standard<00:01:00.570> hose<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.930> we've<00:01:01.079> been

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
with the standard hose that we've been

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.950 
with the standard hose that we've been
using<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:01.829> years<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
using all these years is that the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.939 
using all these years is that the
reinforcements<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.110> wires<00:01:04.530> they're

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
reinforcements are wires they're

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
reinforcements are wires they're
actually<00:01:05.250> wires<00:01:05.580> embedded<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> plastic

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
actually wires embedded into the plastic

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.350 
actually wires embedded into the plastic
and<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> puts<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.729> stress<00:01:09.060> on

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and as you can see it puts a stress on

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
and as you can see it puts a stress on
it<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.689> basically<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.860> prone<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> pin<00:01:11.640> holes

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it and basically it's prone to pin holes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
it and basically it's prone to pin holes
if<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> look<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> inside<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> hose

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
if you look on the inside of the hose

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.820 
if you look on the inside of the hose
you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.270> ridges<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.900> inside<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you can see the ridges on the inside and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
you can see the ridges on the inside and
every<00:01:17.130> time<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> thing<00:01:17.759> collapses<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
every time this thing collapses it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.109 
every time this thing collapses it
collects<00:01:19.229> waste<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.310> moisture<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> debris

be<00:01:47.340> honest<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.030> deserves<00:01:48.630> some

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
be honest with you this deserves some

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.170 
be honest with you this deserves some
looking<00:01:49.229> into<00:01:49.619> first<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.850> nozzle

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
looking into first of all on the nozzle

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.050 
looking into first of all on the nozzle
end<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> positive<00:01:52.530> shutoff<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
end here you have a positive shutoff so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
end here you have a positive shutoff so
when<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.450> dump<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.840> holding<00:01:55.259> tanks<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
when you dump your holding tanks you can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.359 
when you dump your holding tanks you can
indeed<00:01:56.909> shut<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> off<00:01:57.780> entirely<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
indeed shut it off entirely so that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
indeed shut it off entirely so that
there's<00:01:59.549> no<00:01:59.759> moisture<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.540> no<00:02:00.780> seepage<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.560> any

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
there's no moisture or no seepage of any

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.459 
there's no moisture or no seepage of any
waste<00:02:02.100> coming<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> nozzle<00:02:03.469> secondly

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
waste coming out of the nozzle secondly

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.789 
waste coming out of the nozzle secondly
at<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> other<00:02:04.860> end<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.600> poly<00:02:06.840> chute<00:02:07.170> as

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
at the other end of the poly chute as

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.279 
at the other end of the poly chute as
you<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> got<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> cap<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.989> you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
you see it's got a cap on it so as you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.110 
you see it's got a cap on it so as you
disconnect<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.129> from<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.640> bayonet

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
disconnect this from your bayonet

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.710 
disconnect this from your bayonet

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
on your termination assembly you can cap

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.630 
on your termination assembly you can cap
