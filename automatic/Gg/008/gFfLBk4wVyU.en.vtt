day<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:06.480> our<00:00:06.569> offense<00:00:07.130> we<00:00:08.150> definitely<00:00:09.150> are

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
day for our offense we definitely are

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.129 
day for our offense we definitely are
coaching<00:00:10.320> way<00:00:10.469> too<00:00:10.530> many<00:00:10.889> guys<00:00:11.630> right<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:12.660> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
coaching way too many guys right now to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.980 
coaching way too many guys right now to
try<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.410> be<00:00:13.769> polished<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> entire

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
try to be polished I think the entire

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.529 
try to be polished I think the entire
second<00:00:16.650> line<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.400> freshman<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.150> redshirt

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
second line is freshman a redshirt

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.000 
second line is freshman a redshirt
freshman<00:00:19.080> pretty<00:00:19.470> much<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:21.020> but<00:00:22.020> except<00:00:22.470> our

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
freshman pretty much and but except our

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
freshman pretty much and but except our
first<00:00:23.250> line<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.680> adjusted<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
first line it's just adjusted so so and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.700 
first line it's just adjusted so so and
receivers<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:29.220> coaching<00:00:29.400> about<00:00:30.710> 1516

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
receivers we're coaching about 1516

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.700 
receivers we're coaching about 1516
receivers<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.420> 10<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:33.809> 11<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.500> those

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
receivers and I think 10 or 11 of those

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
receivers and I think 10 or 11 of those
guys<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:34.980> first-year<00:00:35.489> guys<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> anyway<00:00:37.320> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
guys are first-year guys so anyway it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
guys are first-year guys so anyway it's
