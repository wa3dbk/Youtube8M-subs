hello I'm Leigh Chantal from viva love

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.100 
hello I'm Leigh Chantal from viva love
being<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:02.909> debt<00:00:03.270> now<00:00:03.510> I'm<00:00:03.600> going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.899> talk<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
being in debt now I'm going to talk to

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.249 
being in debt now I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.410> protein<00:00:05.040> combining<00:00:05.750> now<00:00:06.750> protein

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
you about protein combining now protein

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.470 
you about protein combining now protein
is<00:00:07.710> built<00:00:07.980> up<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.189> amino<00:00:08.340> acids<00:00:09.059> which<00:00:09.210> are<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
is built up of amino acids which are the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480 
is built up of amino acids which are the
building<00:00:09.690> blocks<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.200> protein<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.889> there's<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
building blocks of protein and there's a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.919 
building blocks of protein and there's a
lot<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> different<00:00:11.849> amino<00:00:12.300> acids<00:00:12.870> that

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
lot of different amino acids that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.680 
lot of different amino acids that
together<00:00:13.170> make<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> good<00:00:14.340> form<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.700> protein<00:00:15.030> you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
together make a good form of protein you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.359 
together make a good form of protein you
can<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:15.990> these<00:00:16.139> amino<00:00:16.529> acid<00:00:16.859> de<00:00:16.980> no<00:00:17.100> more

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
can get these amino acid de no more

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.620 
can get these amino acid de no more
products<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.060> don't<00:00:18.240> want<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.600> that

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
products but we don't want to do that

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.670 
products but we don't want to do that
because<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.199> ithaca<00:00:19.770> land<00:00:20.010> morally<00:00:20.460> wrong

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
because that's ithaca land morally wrong

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.099 
because that's ithaca land morally wrong
but<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.400> get<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.240> complete

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
but you can also get your complete

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.279 
but you can also get your complete
protein<00:00:25.890> from<00:00:26.099> other<00:00:26.310> vegan<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.210> vegetarian

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
protein from other vegan and vegetarian

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.589 
protein from other vegan and vegetarian
sources<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> best<00:00:29.580> way<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.119> there's<00:00:30.359> three

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
sources the best way is there's three

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
sources the best way is there's three
different<00:00:30.779> types<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.349> protein<00:00:31.859> okay<00:00:32.219> you've

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
different types of protein okay you've

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.360 
different types of protein okay you've
got<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.210> grains<00:00:33.719> you've<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:34.860> pulses

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
got your grains you've got your pulses

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.049 
got your grains you've got your pulses
and<00:00:35.579> you've<00:00:35.820> got<00:00:35.969> your<00:00:36.120> nuts<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.559> example

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
and you've got your nuts so for example

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.619 
and you've got your nuts so for example
nuts<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> seeds<00:00:39.390> you've<00:00:40.020> got<00:00:40.399> cashews

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
nuts and seeds you've got cashews

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.420 
nuts and seeds you've got cashews
sunflower<00:00:42.629> seeds<00:00:43.050> tahini<00:00:43.649> comes<00:00:44.010> into<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
sunflower seeds tahini comes into that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
sunflower seeds tahini comes into that
because<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:44.879> sesame<00:00:45.390> paste<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.129> heaps

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
because it's from sesame paste on heaps

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
because it's from sesame paste on heaps
of<00:00:47.309> different<00:00:47.430> things<00:00:47.820> cashews<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.530> you're

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of different things cashews so if you're

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.930 
of different things cashews so if you're
cooking<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.100> meal<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.520> you're<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> have

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
cooking a meal and you're going to have

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
cooking a meal and you're going to have
cashews<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.289> combine<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> with

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
cashews with it you will combine it with

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
cashews with it you will combine it with
something<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> other<00:00:53.579> two<00:00:53.850> groups<00:00:54.120> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
something from the other two groups so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.720 
something from the other two groups so
say<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.079> would<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.440> cashews<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.430> brown

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
say you would have cashews with brown

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
say you would have cashews with brown
rice<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.170> could<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.649> cashews<00:00:59.280> with

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
rice or you could have cashews with

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
rice or you could have cashews with
chickpeas<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.590> say<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.800> example<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:02.250> you're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
chickpeas or say for example if you're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.609 
chickpeas or say for example if you're
making<00:01:02.730> something<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.989> kidney<00:01:04.350> beans

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
making something for with kidney beans

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.500 
making something for with kidney beans
and<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.820> rice<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and you want to make it with rice the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
and you want to make it with rice the
other<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.430> each<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
other two if you take two from each of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
other two if you take two from each of
those<00:01:08.850> three<00:01:08.909> groups<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.689> protein<00:01:10.290> you'll<00:01:10.470> get

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
those three groups of protein you'll get

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
those three groups of protein you'll get
your<00:01:10.830> combined<00:01:11.189> pressing<00:01:11.640> together<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
your combined pressing together and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.450 
your combined pressing together and
that's<00:01:12.840> good<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.710> should<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:14.010> having<00:01:14.159> protein

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that's good you should be having protein

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
that's good you should be having protein
every<00:01:14.850> single<00:01:15.299> meal<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.720> as<00:01:16.470> vegan<00:01:16.830> that's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
every single meal and as vegan that's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
every single meal and as vegan that's
fine<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:17.939> vegetarians<00:01:18.659> that's<00:01:18.900> fine

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
fine and as vegetarians that's fine

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.690 
fine and as vegetarians that's fine
because<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.580> many

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
because you can get it from so many

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.590 
because you can get it from so many
sources<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:22.020> make<00:01:22.200> sure<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.619> complete

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
sources just make sure your complete

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
sources just make sure your complete
completely<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.900> combining<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.189> protein

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
completely on combining all your protein

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
completely on combining all your protein
see<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> are<00:01:27.330> getting<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.780> protein<00:01:28.229> as

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
see that you are getting the protein as

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.030 
see that you are getting the protein as
you<00:01:29.070> should<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.770> other<00:01:31.770> ways<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you should there are also other ways you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
you should there are also other ways you
can<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.430> protein<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.060> powder<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.780> can

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
can get protein like powder and you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
can get protein like powder and you can
put<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.320> juice<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.829> smoothies<00:01:35.430> over

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
put that in your juice or smoothies over

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
put that in your juice or smoothies over
morning<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> should<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.930> able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> get

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
morning but you should be able to get

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
morning but you should be able to get
every<00:01:37.650> single<00:01:37.770> thing<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.579> from

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
every single thing that you need from

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.020 
every single thing that you need from
plant<00:01:39.119> sources<00:01:39.390> other<00:01:39.869> than<00:01:40.290> vitamin<00:01:40.619> b12<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
plant sources other than vitamin b12 so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.060 
plant sources other than vitamin b12 so
make<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.930> research<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.649> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
make sure you do your research and just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.499 
make sure you do your research and just
experiment<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> different

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
experiment with a lot of different

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
experiment with a lot of different
things<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.560> combinations<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
things and see what combinations you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
things and see what combinations you
like<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.450> example<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> make

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like I for example if I'm going to make

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.460 
like I for example if I'm going to make
a<00:01:50.390> rice<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.689> night<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> make<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a rice one night I'm going to make a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.499 
a rice one night I'm going to make a
curry<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.070> example<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> cook<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.329> big<00:01:54.479> batch

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
curry for example so I cook a big batch

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.950 
curry for example so I cook a big batch
of<00:01:54.720> rice<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.329> curry<00:01:57.719> with

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of rice and then I have curry with

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.380 
of rice and then I have curry with
chickpeas<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.649> example<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.640> that's<00:01:59.820> two<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
chickpeas for example so that's two of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420 
chickpeas for example so that's two of
the<00:02:00.750> different<00:02:01.079> things<00:02:01.380> combined<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the different things combined in one and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.889 
the different things combined in one and
then<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> next<00:02:03.060> day<00:02:03.299> I've<00:02:03.570> still<00:02:03.780> got

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
then the next day I've still got

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.749 
then the next day I've still got
leftover<00:02:04.439> rice<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.159> I'm<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
leftover rice so I'm going to have that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.160 
leftover rice so I'm going to have that
with

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
with

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.800 
with
fine<00:02:06.530> I'll<00:02:06.680> put<00:02:06.890> some<00:02:07.040> cashews<00:02:07.460> with<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.300> so

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
fine I'll put some cashews with it so so

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.960 
fine I'll put some cashews with it so so
many<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.380> many<00:02:09.410> alternatives<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.459> breakfast

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
many so many alternatives to a breakfast

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.970 
many so many alternatives to a breakfast
for<00:02:11.180> example<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.840> could<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.410> rye<00:02:12.680> bread

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
for example you could have rye bread

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.970 
for example you could have rye bread
which<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.790> grain<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.900> some<00:02:15.349> peanut

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
which is grain and have some peanut

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
which is grain and have some peanut
butter<00:02:16.099> on<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.640> example<00:02:16.730> or<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.810> could<00:02:18.050> have

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
butter on for example or you could have

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.050 
butter on for example or you could have
scrambled<00:02:20.000> tofu<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.980> lunch<00:02:22.190> lunch<00:02:22.819> is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
scrambled tofu on for lunch lunch is

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.000 
scrambled tofu on for lunch lunch is
always<00:02:23.420> easy<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.290> only<00:02:24.410> just<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.830> to
