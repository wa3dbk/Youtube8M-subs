event<00:02:45.710> for<00:02:46.180> 2013<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.920> sounds<00:02:49.160> pretty

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
event for 2013 that sounds pretty

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.670 
event for 2013 that sounds pretty
confusing<00:02:49.760> but<00:02:50.120> yeah<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.900> rainbow<00:02:51.290> party<00:02:51.560> had

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
confusing but yeah the rainbow party had

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.250 
confusing but yeah the rainbow party had
actually<00:02:52.010> turned<00:02:52.250> out<00:02:52.370> pretty<00:02:53.020> better<00:02:54.020> than<00:02:54.230> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
actually turned out pretty better than I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.530 
actually turned out pretty better than I
thought<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.590> would<00:02:54.740> actually<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.910> look<00:02:56.090> darlin

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540
