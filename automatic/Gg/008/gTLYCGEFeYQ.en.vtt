00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 We have every single challenge in front 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.029
 evans 4 we made us the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.639
 story looked at we actually have 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.870
 Everything done what you could do 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.000
 I think we all forget a thing 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.000
 halloween update is still here 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.769
 scott the developer from 5 release 1 to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 4 has now announced what in the long 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.980
 addressed halloween update come 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140
 should be what should come on 31.10 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.849
 so what do you want scott so probably 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 it comes earlier in any case he has 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.329
 Now what are in this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.680
 update should be that a few 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.390
 very interesting things here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.860
 At the beginning of the text he writes that he 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.090
 different ideas had something on this 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 make halloween update like for example 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 to open a box at the end of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 leitmeritz see on the sangster best 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.910
 lap garden is on it where he is not 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.980
 know what's inside but later in the text 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.600
 ebita even again gives the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.399
 confirmation it is not necessary to buy 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.719
 that it will be a free update 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 which just downloaded automatically 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.840
 will be what is very good that is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 We do not just have to spend more money on it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.230
 spend on these bonus things and it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.870
 for the extra menu 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.430
 with a challenge mode with a jeep 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 menu and a whole thing we do 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 to recognize the fans early is very nice and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 it should again be new challenges 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.340
 give for people already that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.689
 played through there are more stars 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.010
 2 and that means I want to go back 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.330
 many others have to go out again 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.740
 to have to do that also means that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.000
 her again see more gameplay world because 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.979
 Of course, I want every single one 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 make a challenge and then there is 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.380
 a very cool thing and that works 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 not clinging to a new game 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.299
 Whistles are totally 5 and it will 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.920
 very likely a small demo or 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.900
 a little sneak peek or something 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.659
 give a little insight into the game in 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 this update in it which I pretty much 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.229
 Crass bark is new game from scott 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.880
 which then definitely in this game 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.229
 will be part of this update 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.370
 I think that's really interesting because of me 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.200
 I hope he does 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.700
 short new server game I would be extreme 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 healed on everything the guy becomes 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 Now really on it and then he says something 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.900
 not in this update will be there 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.370
 namely the box he also says how 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.170
 he was incredibly excited that the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.720
 whole community tulloch youtuber the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.760
 whole story of 5 and trace 1 2 and 3 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.280
 but have always found out immediately 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.200
 whistling random 4 was by no one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 Person at the first seen has solved 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.460
 the story it means the story is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.720
 completely different and he says himself all 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.730
 things brought in somehow 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.780
 none of this is an easter egg 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.980
 I probably had that too 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.410
 Right leg theory that the game 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 really 92 plays at the line said 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.590
 he hears is now it just has it 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.480
 but that does not make sense 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 I told you that 's god if 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.630
 you know what a game is easier there 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.160
 For a reason that says if you too 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.750
 even nobody has the story right 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.980
 from the fourth part to the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.030
 installed the similar but seen 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.680
 I do that I do not know 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.730
 right even if I do not know me 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.410
 Think the story is complete 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.460
 basically all think at least in the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.500
 fourth part the first three parts 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.820
 should from theories like most 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.380
 People have said so far 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.390
 be quite right he says 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.910
 but the solution for the fourth part 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.470
 should be in this box in it and he 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.390
 writes here that he did not even know whether 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.010
 he really never wants to open this box 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.959
 if you want this solution 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.410
 the complete story in this box in it 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.670
 his 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.920
 and then the community 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.110
 might not be satisfied with what 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.970
 he does not say he sure but it 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.900
 I really want to sneeze someone over 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.250
 find it in any case mega 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.550
 interesting that means there is one 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.080
 new game by scott give 514 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.020
 go on and it will probably 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.489
 Do not give 515 because says a new game 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.440
 I do not hope so somehow now 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.270
 spin off faces and purple locked 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.350
 horny shit means I hope for everyone 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.970
 case that makes me a completely new one 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.950
 The result will be that of the pack 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.810
 then I would say I am happy 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.970
 extremely looking forward to this update i am now looking forward to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.780
 I then see this update then 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.250
 we are in the second video today people 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.810
 Write comments where we are at 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.880
 most since I am personally 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.260
 because of the new player most 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.650
 I'm really upset that horny 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.650
 get at 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.100
 Okay, okay then we'll meet 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.100
 also later until 3
