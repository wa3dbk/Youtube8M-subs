fennel seeds from the sausage leaked out

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
fennel seeds from the sausage leaked out

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.620 
dice them small so they cook evenly with
the<00:02:02.659> onion<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:10.369> then<00:02:10.819> finally<00:02:11.239> we're<00:02:11.599> going

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
the onion and then finally we're going

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.839 
the onion and then finally we're going
to<00:02:11.840> add<00:02:11.989> our<00:02:12.019> kale<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.489> had<00:02:13.640> one

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
to add our kale and so I just had one

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.390 
to add our kale and so I just had one
bunch<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.330> kale<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.840> tore<00:02:15.260> off<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.099> stem

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
bunch of kale that I tore off the stem

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.890 
bunch of kale that I tore off the stem
so<00:02:16.760> when<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.000> get<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.239> in<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> store<00:02:17.540> it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so when you get it in the store it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.539 
so when you get it in the store it's
gonna<00:02:18.049> look<00:02:18.319> like<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.769> I'm<00:02:19.220> gonna<00:02:19.370> make<00:02:19.519> sure

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
gonna look like this I'm gonna make sure

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.520 
gonna look like this I'm gonna make sure
you<00:02:19.760> wash<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.209> first<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.750> rinse<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.470> then

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
you wash it first and rinse it and then

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.400 
you wash it first and rinse it and then
dry<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.580> Pat<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.000> dry<00:02:23.299> just<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.080> not

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
dry it Pat it dry just so that it's not

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.520 
dry it Pat it dry just so that it's not
soggy<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.940> what<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.299> do<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.690> tear<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.349> off

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
soggy so what you do is just tear it off

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.309 
soggy so what you do is just tear it off
the<00:02:27.799> stem<00:02:28.069> like<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.870> don't<00:02:30.019> want<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.200> eat

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
the stem like so you don't want to eat

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.289 
the stem like so you don't want to eat
the<00:02:30.470> stem<00:02:30.709> because<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.099> really<00:02:31.250> woody<00:02:31.610> so

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
the stem because it's really woody so

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.490 
the stem because it's really woody so
you<00:02:32.390> can't<00:02:32.599> really<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.900> doesn't<00:02:33.140> break<00:02:33.260> down

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
you can't really it doesn't break down

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.940 
you can't really it doesn't break down
very<00:02:33.709> well<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:35.840> our<00:02:35.989> kale<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.860> we're

ingredient<00:03:38.030> which<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.659> a<00:03:39.170> parmesan<00:03:39.799> rind<00:03:40.099> and

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
ingredient which is a parmesan rind and

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.420 
ingredient which is a parmesan rind and
this<00:03:41.599> is<00:03:41.780> really<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.530> gives<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:42.950> really<00:03:43.280> nice

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
this is really it gives it a really nice

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.420 
this is really it gives it a really nice
nutty<00:03:43.849> flavor<00:03:44.329> and<00:03:45.069> it's<00:03:46.069> nice<00:03:46.250> because

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
nutty flavor and it's nice because

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.740 
nutty flavor and it's nice because
you're<00:03:46.579> not<00:03:46.700> wasting<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.239> ingredient

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
you're not wasting this ingredient

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.879 
you're not wasting this ingredient
because<00:03:47.840> normally<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:48.349> is<00:03:48.500> something<00:03:48.799> you

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
because normally this is something you

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.909 
because normally this is something you
would<00:03:49.010> probably<00:03:49.099> just<00:03:49.639> throw<00:03:49.849> away<00:03:49.939> but<00:03:50.919> it's

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
would probably just throw away but it's

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.339 
would probably just throw away but it's
and<00:03:52.849> it's<00:03:53.120> gonna<00:03:53.239> melt<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:53.629> a<00:03:53.810> little<00:03:54.079> bit

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
and it's gonna melt down a little bit

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.289 
and it's gonna melt down a little bit
and<00:03:54.680> make<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.010> soup<00:03:55.280> really<00:03:55.819> really<00:03:56.120> yummy

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
and make that soup really really yummy

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.839 
and make that soup really really yummy
and<00:03:56.900> then<00:03:57.109> we're<00:03:57.200> also<00:03:57.349> adding<00:03:57.829> a<00:03:58.430> half

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:15.189 
dry thyme we're going to stir that
through<00:04:12.400> then<00:04:13.400> we<00:04:13.489> pop<00:04:13.729> a<00:04:13.760> lid<00:04:14.060> on<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:14.659> let
