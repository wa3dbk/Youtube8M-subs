00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.020 

because<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.410> was<00:00:01.589> annoyed<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.129> every<00:00:02.580> time<00:00:02.790> I

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
because I was annoyed that every time I

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.360 
because I was annoyed that every time I
came<00:00:03.600> home<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.049> had<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.350> take<00:00:04.500> out<00:00:04.710> my<00:00:04.740> teeth

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
came home and had to take out my teeth

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.419 
came home and had to take out my teeth
to<00:00:05.460> open<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.029> front<00:00:06.359> gate<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:07.040> decided<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.220> want

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
to open the front gate I decided I want

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.720 
to open the front gate I decided I want
a<00:00:08.519> fun<00:00:08.700> guy<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> be<00:00:09.090> keyless<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:10.769> first<00:00:11.550> I

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
a fun guy to be keyless so first I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.350 
a fun guy to be keyless so first I
considered<00:00:12.210> using<00:00:12.540> RFID<00:00:13.349> or<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.710> keypad<00:00:14.360> but

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
considered using RFID or a keypad but

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060 
considered using RFID or a keypad but
those<00:00:15.509> all<00:00:15.750> involved<00:00:16.080> installing<00:00:16.740> extra

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
those all involved installing extra

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.939 
those all involved installing extra
harker<00:00:17.460> at<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.820> gate<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.619> running<00:00:19.619> extra

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
harker at the gate and running extra

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:39.750 
harker at the gate and running extra
cables<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.720> that's<00:00:22.320> why<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> came<00:00:22.680> up<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.250> this

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.060 

so<00:00:40.760> now<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:41.149> can<00:00:41.480> open<00:00:41.989> my<00:00:42.140> son<00:00:42.379> gates<00:00:42.710> by

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
so now you can open my son gates by

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.600 
so now you can open my son gates by
ringing<00:00:43.489> in<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:44.140> secret<00:00:45.140> pre-recorded<00:00:45.980> pattern

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.750 

and<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.350> port<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.800> decides<00:00:55.399> when

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and this is the port that decides when

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.759 
and this is the port that decides when
to<00:00:55.790> open<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.300> gate<00:00:56.480> or<00:00:56.780> when<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.440> ring<00:00:57.620> the

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
to open the gate or when to ring the

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.720 
to open the gate or when to ring the
bell<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:59.350> this<00:01:00.350> project<00:01:00.620> is<00:01:00.949> based<00:01:01.129> around<00:01:01.430> a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
bell so this project is based around a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.600 
bell so this project is based around a
metronome<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.839> Arduino<00:01:03.320> clone<00:01:03.559> developed<00:01:04.250> by

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
metronome and Arduino clone developed by

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.219 
metronome and Arduino clone developed by
the<00:01:04.670> bit<00:01:05.180> layer<00:01:05.360> headspace<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
the bit layer headspace in the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.600 
the bit layer headspace in the
Netherlands<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:09.200> basically<00:01:09.770> sits<00:01:10.159> in<00:01:10.369> the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
Netherlands it basically sits in the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.940 
Netherlands it basically sits in the
middle<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.330> doorbell<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.530> rest<00:01:12.800> up

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
middle of the doorbell and you rest up

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.070 
middle of the doorbell and you rest up
the<00:01:13.100> old<00:01:13.250> installation<00:01:13.910> so<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.210> can<00:01:14.539> just<00:01:14.780> cut

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
the old installation so you can just cut

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.580 
the old installation so you can just cut
your<00:01:15.200> wire<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.710> install<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.840> what

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
your wire and install it there and what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.980 
your wire and install it there and what
the<00:01:18.740> dust<00:01:18.950> when<00:01:19.220> someone<00:01:19.580> rings<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:19.880> bell<00:01:20.119> it

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the dust when someone rings the bell it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.520 
the dust when someone rings the bell it
first

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
first

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.880 
first
records<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.280> entire<00:01:22.640> sequence<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.679> will

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
records the entire sequence and it will

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.520 
records the entire sequence and it will
then<00:01:25.009> match<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.340> against<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.530> pre-recorded

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
then match that against the pre-recorded

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.310 
then match that against the pre-recorded
secret<00:01:27.950> sequence<00:01:28.369> if<00:01:28.910> those<00:01:29.179> match<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.929> will

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
secret sequence if those match it will

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.310 
secret sequence if those match it will
open<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.130> gates<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.700> if<00:01:32.690> they<00:01:32.899> don't<00:01:33.140> match

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
open the gates and if they don't match

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.510 
open the gates and if they don't match
it<00:01:33.649> will<00:01:33.950> ring<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.280> doorbell<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:36.429> just<00:01:37.429> to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
it will ring the doorbell so just to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.100 
it will ring the doorbell so just to
demonstrate<00:01:37.550> this<00:01:38.450> button<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.929> the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
demonstrate this button is the

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.899 
demonstrate this button is the
equivalent<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.619> ringing<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.039> doorbell<00:01:40.429> this

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
equivalent of ringing the doorbell this

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.260 
equivalent of ringing the doorbell this
one<00:01:41.149> is<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.420> program<00:01:41.690> button<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.520> when<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.060> input

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
one is a program button so when I input

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.230 
one is a program button so when I input
the<00:01:44.509> secret<00:01:45.110> sequence<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:52.100> will<00:01:52.520> open<00:01:52.939> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
the secret sequence it will open the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.749 
the secret sequence it will open the
front<00:01:53.600> door<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.079> when<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.740> am<00:01:55.009> put<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.340> wrong

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
front door and when I am put a wrong

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.999 
front door and when I am put a wrong
sequence<00:01:59.140> it<00:02:00.140> will<00:02:00.170> ring<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.770> doorbell<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:03.320> to

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
sequence it will ring the doorbell so to

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.370 
sequence it will ring the doorbell so to
input<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.939> new<00:02:05.119> secret<00:02:05.420> sequence<00:02:05.930> all<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.229> do

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
input the new secret sequence all I do

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.430 
input the new secret sequence all I do
is<00:02:06.590> press<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.130> program<00:02:07.520> button<00:02:07.810> then<00:02:08.810> puts<00:02:09.140> a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
is press the program button then puts a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.430 
is press the program button then puts a
new<00:02:09.679> pattern<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.690> will<00:02:11.870> write<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
new pattern and it will write that to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.500 
new pattern and it will write that to
the<00:02:12.530> EEPROM<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.130> from<00:02:13.430> now<00:02:13.579> on<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
the EEPROM and from now on this is the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.260 
the EEPROM and from now on this is the
secret<00:02:14.780> sequence
