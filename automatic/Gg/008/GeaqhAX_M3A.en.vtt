00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.960
 and I think all very good at all 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.930
 here in 1924 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.180
 I bring you what this discovery is 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.070
 that you just get as you can see 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.169
 here is trying one of the friends 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.169
 they hooked up to the car no post 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:40.120
 is one is something that we find out between my 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.269
 friends and me and it's a way to get some 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.390
 awards is like listening to some prizes 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.899
 that not everyone has it 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.140
 apparently I think nobody has 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.170
 taken out or very few have done it and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.480
 they avoided talking about what it consists 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.360
 is call the awards are jumps 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.850
 mortals and how can you see here 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.490
 we unlock it using a charge for 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.080
 any car does not necessarily have 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.930
 that being a tool of these does not 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.720
 any car but using a charge 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.800
 they hook him up as you can see him and he 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 they begin to take to raise once 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.070
 arrive at the height of the mountain that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.140
 well I did tell my friend Derek that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.960
 I will rise enough for this one 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.330
 get that they are getting the prizes 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.789
 and others of a milestone 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.490
 because they can do it from a height 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.679
 of like for example also the hangar and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.050
 they give them a first medal which is the 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.330
 bronze after the silver hits him 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.770
 from today 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.800
 Well, as you can see, see that is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.010
 the great height many will say you are not going to 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 kill as possible not try it 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.000
 will destroy pigs mastiffs to the ground 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.130
 I was doing this with a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.780
 friend who is giovanni already must also 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.790
 to know a lot on my channel and good 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.790
 Well, let's see what he throws 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.060
 I hope the same happened the same and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.420
 Giovanni was pitching and box 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.420
 wait if that was how it comes down 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:26.040
 and so this last look is prize 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.680
 prize and prize for this we have fallen 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.710
 well as you can see I'm missing a little bit 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.290
 to get to the last round but as 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.780
 you can see it is relatively simple 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.240
 and if this is so 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.130
 the trick and other good that is not trick 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.700
 it's a real fallacy to see it from good people 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.890
 that pass and no and nothing is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.130
 simply a way to get 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.380
 quickly those medals and well then 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.390
 that segment and lose mind small 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.600
 because this is basically the only thing that 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:05.560
 I wanted to bring them, we already have 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.989
 let's see I'm going to leave you again 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.300
 the repetition so they can see how it is 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.750
 this sign unnecessarily today more 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.580
 they have repeat in the video there is no 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.910
 problem anyway leave the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.340
 small cachito where the prizes go out 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.500
 for the credits that I do but good 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.769
 Well, guys, as you can see, we're with 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.590
 levels and then so good the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.209
 I will leave with this great image I hope that 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.940
 you liked this little temple and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.160
 the truth is the shortest I've done 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.700
 the truth does not reach even the three 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.209
 minutes or maybe a little more 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.550
 well I hope you serve them that are about 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.040
 very good prizes the truth and so on 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.599
 they take them all out of a pull like 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.269
 they could beautiful already had the level of 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.510
 bronze just missing the gold I say 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.040
 silver and gold and platinum I already got it 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.660
 so then good guys I hope they 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.480
 have liked this little gameplay is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.800
 probably very short as short as 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.800
 Can be done 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:13.620
 minecraft xbox pc gta I will bring 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.510
 also black ops that usually this 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.400
 the player not with good friends and then 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.040
 little more guys then see you in the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.510
