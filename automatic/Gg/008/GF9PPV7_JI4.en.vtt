00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.280
 I think I used to like fashion 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.889
 very much the style and the way of seeing it 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.389
 everything of being very much the style the clothes 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.550
 so I think that saying something of 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.640
 movistar I do not know I do not know if I had done 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.740
 another sport 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.700
 I think he had really done 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.880
 athletics would have continued studying and 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.440
 the truth that I do not know surely something 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.280
 related to sports because I was 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.020
 It's good but I do not know if it would have been 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.810
 I would have also given as how football 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.340
 the truth that I do not think so, I did not have 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.370
 pretty clear since I was little I wanted 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.230
 I wanted to play soccer I feel 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.010
 a privileged to be able to be at these 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.690
 at these levels and the truth that I do what 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 what I like and in no time 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.510
 I think about what it was that had 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.719
 liked to do 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.699
 in fact I was playing until 12 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.500
 years competing for Spain and then we 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.259
 I said soccer ballista the truth that no 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.869
 I think of something other than soccer 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.299
 Well now I also work 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.100
 of the subject of readaptation then then 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.610
 Well, ready, jumping physicist 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.610
 trainer 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.700
 I will have nothing footballer because the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.440
 I do not know , I really like the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 I like tennis too , tennis 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.910
 ping-pong but I do not think I would have 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.800
 taken so seriously and with so much enjoyment 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.880
 as I have with this for this 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.680
 sport then I think there would be 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 continue with what I am studying now 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.410
 what physiotherapy and I have been with it 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.150
 also working studying and what 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.160
 fall for that profession then 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.010
 I would surely be a teacher because that 's what 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.200
 that I studied and I would finish my career and 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.600
 I would go to work but the truth is 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.670
 that from the first moment I knew that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.220
 there was a possibility of being able to be 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.850
 professional footballer 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.690
 I grabbed her and it was my dream and 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.690
 final achieved
