00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.799
 we are going to see in this opportunity this 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.250
 fantasy point that the spikes of the point 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.040
 they are crossed and that makes us see 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.810
 our much more beautiful work is not 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.080
 reversible 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 the stitch leaves only for the right 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.550
 the sample has 18 points that are 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.879
 multiples of 2 always the needles that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.530
 use for this sample are number 9 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:44.460
 that equals 5.5 millimeters wool 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.500
 number 4 very soft we do that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.920
 here are our 18 points that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 we just put together to start this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.290
 so beautiful design first the first 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.600
 race is done all in one right spot 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.409
 then do not forget that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.710
 always always always it targeted 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.549
 all the races from the right side 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.369
 they go in a right point of principle to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.360
 end do not forget them on the side of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.880
 right we always do them at one point 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.880
 straight 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.820
 all 18 points there is no edge of anything 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 that's because the stitch is very complete 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.640
 then we will get to the end of 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.250
 our first race all was a 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.440
 right point 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 let's go to the second one that is made of the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.420
 next form 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.930
 we make a common reverse point 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 then we make two points together 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.729
 in a reverse point the truth but not what 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.060
 we let go or pass them but with the nail 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.240
 we open them a little bit we take the first 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.890
 point and we do it again in point 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 setback that's it, that design is over 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.090
 let's repeat two points together in a 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.890
 backhand point without releasing them or passing them 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.069
 the needle 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.850
 we open here a little bit we make a point 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.950
 backhand and let go 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.340
 two points together in a backhand 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.739
 the first point of those two points the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.020
 we separate and introduce the needle through 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.940
 medium and we do it in a backhand 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.620
 and let's go 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.049
 two points together in a backhand 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.349
 without passing the needle we take the 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:50.380
 first of those two we take the first 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.640
 we do it in a backhand point and let's go 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:58.930
 two points together in a backhand 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.920
 let's go here we open up and make a point 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.790
 backhand and we drop two points together in a 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.940
 backhand we knit again at one point 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.810
 reverse the first point of those two and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.290
 let's go 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.930
 two points together in a backhand 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.200
 we take the first one we do it again 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:27.480
 in a backhand point and let go 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:31.160
 two points together in backhand 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.840
 we go back to knitting the first 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.650
 let's go and we end up with a backhand 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.800
 that was career number 2 we're going to 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.340
 make career number 3 that very 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.640
 simple from start to finish is made 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.980
 same as race number 1 as they 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.230
 I said by the right at a right point 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.150
 I finished career number 3 as I 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.300
 I said for the right in right point 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.900
 we were going to race number 4 we started 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.860
 as we already know two points together in 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.220
 point reverse and we repeat with the first 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.770
 what we already know what we do again 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.430
 again in reverse point 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.430
 we had two we have two let's go 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.310
 I remember again two points together in 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.440
 point backwards with the nail with the finger 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.290
 we separate we introduce again the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.600
 needle we go back to do the reverse and 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.100
 let's go 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.040
 two points together in a backhand point and 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.380
 we return to knit in a backhand 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.140
 the next point 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.720
 the whole race the whole row of 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.690
 beginning to end of this race number 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.330
 four which is the last of this design 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.740
 we do it exactly the same when 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.410
 come to determine these four 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.690
 races repeat them as many times as 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.450
 necessary to achieve over 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.210
 the stitch is a chalet with shawl what 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.550
 need a blanket 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.389
 and the same to the wide but they always have 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.880
 that ride higher points multiples of 2 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.340
 that is the only way for them to 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.729
 look so pretty visit my page 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.520
 how to knit dotcom there will find the 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.979
 written instructions of this and all 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.979
 the stitches that I teach 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.979
 permanently
