that I use speed of dot me because html5
only<00:01:10.770> um<00:01:11.460> speed<00:01:12.360> test<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.560> my<00:01:13.950> test<00:01:14.220> results

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
only um speed test so my test results

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
only um speed test so my test results
should<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.909> different<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> um<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
should be different from from it um it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
should be different from from it um it
uses<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> runs<00:01:17.759> off<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.939> chicago<00:01:18.659> server<00:01:18.930> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
uses it runs off the chicago server so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100 
uses it runs off the chicago server so
it<00:01:19.979> tends<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.909> running<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.360> better<00:01:21.570> my

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it tends to be running a lot better my

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.920 
it tends to be running a lot better my
ping<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> normally<00:01:22.799> normally<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.670> 115<00:01:24.659> but

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
ping is normally normally not 115 but

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
ping is normally normally not 115 but
it's<00:01:25.049> usually<00:01:25.229> around<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.810> 20<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.320> um<00:01:28.909> as

connections I'll connect to the wire so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.089 
connections I'll connect to the wire so
I'm<00:02:58.599> connecting<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.079> wires<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.470> then<00:02:59.560> try

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
I'm connecting the wires and then try

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.940 
I'm connecting the wires and then try

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
port on your router meals so basically

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.890 
port on your router meals so basically
try<00:03:06.189> different<00:03:06.370> port<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.359> that<00:03:07.510> doesn't<00:03:07.780> work

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
try different port if that doesn't work

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.949 
try different port if that doesn't work
then<00:03:08.230> personal<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.299> um<00:03:10.299> we<00:03:10.569> start<00:03:10.840> your

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
then personal and um we start your

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.330 
then personal and um we start your
network<00:03:11.260> hardware<00:03:11.680> if<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.010> doesn't<00:03:12.280> work

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
network hardware if that doesn't work

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.860 
network hardware if that doesn't work
then<00:03:12.549> first<00:03:12.730> no<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.299> then<00:03:13.450> changing<00:03:13.780> your

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
then first no and then changing your

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.179 
then first no and then changing your
firewall<00:03:14.200> settings<00:03:14.409> that<00:03:14.799> doesn't<00:03:15.069> work

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
firewall settings that doesn't work

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.430 
firewall settings that doesn't work
first<00:03:15.730> no<00:03:15.849> I<00:03:16.090> think<00:03:16.299> it'll<00:03:16.720> keep<00:03:16.930> going<00:03:17.139> until

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
first no I think it'll keep going until

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.110 
first no I think it'll keep going until
you<00:03:17.680> find<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:18.099> solution<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.609> fixes<00:03:18.970> your

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
you find a solution that fixes your

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.140 
you find a solution that fixes your
router<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.980> change<00:03:20.980> putting<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.430> DMZ<00:03:21.970> um

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
router and change putting it to DMZ um

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.879 
router and change putting it to DMZ um
that<00:03:22.989> doesn't<00:03:23.199> work<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.440> first<00:03:23.620> um

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
that doesn't work so first um

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.369 
that doesn't work so first um
and<00:03:24.030> ok<00:03:25.030> our<00:03:25.150> system<00:03:25.540> cache<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.959> already<00:03:26.230> did

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
and ok our system cache I already did

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.979 
and ok our system cache I already did
that<00:03:26.560> I've<00:03:27.280> already<00:03:27.459> done<00:03:27.579> this<00:03:27.819> um<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.599> ended

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
that I've already done this um I ended

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.869 
that I've already done this um I ended
up<00:03:29.230> fixing<00:03:29.500> -<00:03:29.859> and<00:03:30.250> cleared<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.609> system

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
up fixing - and cleared out the system

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.309 
up fixing - and cleared out the system
cache<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.389> then<00:03:31.480> that's<00:03:31.659> it<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.049> switched

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
cache and then that's it and I switched

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.050 
cache and then that's it and I switched
off<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> port<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.159> the<00:03:33.459> port<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.879> it<00:03:33.970> was
