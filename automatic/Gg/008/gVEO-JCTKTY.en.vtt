00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.250
 Well, I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.630
 the whole issue of firefox or is we have 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.640
 had occasion to see at the fair the 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.840
 presentation of various devices and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.270
 well I'll show you a little bit how 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.400
 is the whole issue at software level like 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.540
 you can see the main part first 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.090
 that we find is a desk 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.439
 as in any current smartphone and 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.869
 then we have all the sides 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.700
 our collection of applications 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.280
 we can customize it exactly the same 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.920
 that in other systems simply 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.910
 let's click and drag the icons 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.910
 as we see the desk next 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.630
 to install applications is so 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.010
 simple as it can be in any 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.800
 another system we always have the option 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 to pull the marketplace simply 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.130
 would enter select is an application 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.230
 among the categories that there are 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.820
 example the category of games in after 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.220
 select one from the list and install it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.720
 it would not have more complication but 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.970
 besides having the option to install it 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.650
 from the marketplace you have another 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.120
 option more than to install it for example 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.190
 from the browser you do not have to 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.740
 you have to complicate simply 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.020
 you enter the page 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.020
 and with a click on a couple of links 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 we also have the option to install 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.300
 applications or use them from the network 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.070
 of windows or simply search 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.290
 you would search for content or types of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.870
 applications exactly as in the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 market and you could install in fact if 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.040
 you use applications continuously 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 you have the option to see install the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.680
 here installed directly on your 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.680
 desk 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.930
 we only add it to the desk 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.430
 we would have available to be able 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.730
 use it at any time from 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.560
 our device 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.480
 then at software level you always have the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.980
 option of updates all 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.120
 applications that you have received through 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.460
 from through the market 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.170
 the authors of this and the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.220
 system would also send them to you 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.220
 through another 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.060
 well basically as you can see it is what 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.480
 normal in a smartphone application 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.069
 of call contacts messages and others a 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.510
 email client and 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.510
 equestrian calendar in this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.360
 and the whole theme of the options menu
