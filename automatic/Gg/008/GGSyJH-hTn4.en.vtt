brains would have to go to bane
um<00:02:27.709> speed<00:02:28.670> probably<00:02:29.270> Bane<00:02:29.690> strength<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.890> would

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
um speed probably Bane strength I would

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.250 
um speed probably Bane strength I would
go<00:02:31.459> with<00:02:31.580> Solomon<00:02:32.150> Grundy<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.810> one<00:02:33.020> but

dropkick from the fucking sky look at

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.610 
dropkick from the fucking sky look at
this<00:03:30.880> if<00:03:31.880> Solomon<00:03:32.180> Grundy<00:03:32.750> did<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.380> Bane

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.979 
this if Solomon Grundy did that to Bane
I<00:03:33.950> think<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.670> would<00:03:34.790> probably<00:03:35.180> break<00:03:35.570> Bane's

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
I think that would probably break Bane's

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.750 
I think that would probably break Bane's
back<00:03:36.440> or<00:03:36.680> something<00:03:37.010> cuz<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:37.280> he's<00:03:37.459> throwing

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
back or something cuz like he's throwing

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.880 
back or something cuz like he's throwing
