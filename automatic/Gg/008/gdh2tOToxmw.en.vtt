00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.400
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.179
 video tutorial 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.789
 today we will see how to solve the problem 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.369
 we say that when we go to 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.960
 turn off your pc via this frets 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.880
 here I say not only 18 but also in 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.400
 seven is seen and others 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.030
 this does not turn off the PC in this 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.250
 wife problem to laptops now not 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.760
 I'm sure it happens even in faces 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.560
 although I don't know if it's so common 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.720
 even though I know someone has happened that 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.020
 pressing this system the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.810
 baby turned off completely but 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.210
 went like in suspension 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.060
 so as we remember it is very simple 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.680
 we have to write we have to tell the pc of 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.629
 turn off in say in quotation marks 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.759
 automatic ie that if without losing 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.100
 this text 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.479
 when we will open a file 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.030
 then here is how to do and 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.219
 very simple sissi messina then key 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.799
 right new text document 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.380
 we rename as we want 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:25.179
 and we do ok we open it we write 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.100
 shutdown comes out there is a beautiful fact but 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.560
 there is a little dull or save as 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.670
 steps that you then rename to post risk 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.160
 put us bots 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.370
 here's how often this file when 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.170
 will start will open now i can't 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.190
 do for me because if you don't turn off pc e 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.050
 logically the front of the commands will come out 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.180
 which will open and close in 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.610
 very little time and after a while one will come out 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.820
 barraco same pc will shut down in a minute 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.170
 and I don't know if it does even mino's server 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.720
 storage and preserve this every time 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.810
 that having to shut down the PC does not cause 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.020
 problems like forced shutdown comes 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.180
 made by a specific power button 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.790
 here is this problem solved a lot 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.220
 as simple and fast as this tutorial 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.540
 see you at the next video putting in 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.280

 help with any other questions 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.830
 Also ask about it in the comments of so many

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.650
 see you at the next video passed by
