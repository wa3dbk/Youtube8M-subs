00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello UTB psycho arthur and today I 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.280
 show you one of yours was on 59 of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.260
 we generally have two such major 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 regime 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.199
 fight on ltshka which is wild to me 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 delivers it passive for light and wild 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.480
 carousels and any such 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.529
 skirmish near the heavier and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.449
 massive machines such dominance 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.349
 light and small over large and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 clumsy 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 But in this battle it turned out to some 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 a combination of these tactics 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 that is, initially this card is not at all 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 designed for someone active 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.489
 Illumination there is a maximum 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.200
 some advice can only be given at the beginning 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.200
 show traveling enemy or from the gut 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 or from a more forceful position to which 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 I'm going to go this here this bush can 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 It would certainly be a bit far but with 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 given the fact that the enemy has 12 had a chance 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.140
 the fact that he will go 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.600
 too, where the patient is so hassle la 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 was with him could end for me 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.670
 at least baku it will be a bun here 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.610
 enemy cords or pooj so i'm here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 I'm also going to be careful just a little further away 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.810
 for the light you share here with 59 that is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.780
 he is now in the gut lit up a little 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.820
 farther than me here I could trace him 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.939
 a little bit on throwing up there are cases 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 even when you can't do it everywhere 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.460
 contribution for knows how standard drunk 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 that is to light the enemy team in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.560
 this case if you are a nation 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 lets you rolled out this car into that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 the same equipment that I have with 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.790
 Gold you can calmly throw on 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.549
 on these cars passing even there 400 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.030
 + meters principle, any nine 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.520
 breaks with breaks here it is at 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.000
 how many of us are here 189 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 enough with head plus very big 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.670
 chance 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.120
 for criticizing something so often something 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.700
 you set fire especially if 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.640
 for the same board the enemy usually and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.200
 happens and there you bucks ammo all 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 it is often criticized and seen by example 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.320
 classic set on fire but as soon as that's 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 this initial combat phase is over and no 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.620
 the ability to actively highlight 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.720
 most players squatting 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.690
 problems arise that is they don't know 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.260
 how to use my car here with me 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 there is advice 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 only one try not to break in 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.240
 right away that is without breaking your head 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.480
 understand of course that any lt-sc 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.550
 who comes on board the sergeant TCP 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.640
 aldo who are shot in the city 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.620
 can make a noise that is so or 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.040
 otherwise you will make some contribution to the battle. 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.480
 if you just break through to the city and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.660
 there is literally a tank aunt 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.660
 one point to kind due to this your 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.630
 allies will be able to inflict free damage 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.210
 but to lead and more damage and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.980
 it is worth the situation initially 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.320
 I'll forgive what I'm doing right now 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.680
 peered the city looked at one 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.630
 lane but a little auto 22 realized that 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.690
 so far it's too early that is my cheesecakes 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.690
 more back and plus I see that the opponents 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.610
 most are in cities and 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.290
 begin to move forward so I 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.300
 now I am going to read what is there 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.470
 further and I had the opportunity 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.810
 drive to the rear 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.880
 now I see it that is, I thought first 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.370
 may require cats board under this 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.050
 home realized that I am now open here by 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 straight to this lumbago which is now 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.370
 I look here it can not push worth 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.190
 maybe someone else so I decide 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.860
 initially so far wait a bit and in 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.570
 I will go there right now in order to 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.540
 read the situation that is a month was 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.160
 choice in principle go straight to gba on 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.790
 base in the enemy 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:57.780
 here try to pick up artillery but I 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.110
 decide right thing to break into mess and the 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.160
 meeting here 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.190
 isu-152 sbl 9 with its covers this f-shka 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.420
 t-22 building started so i'm here 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.270
 I am leaving him I understand that it is time 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.000
 skip yuzat this chance and here in 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.040
 the moment I realized that in principle there is no point 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.959
 now I could go further 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.500
 would take away from it now 12 hulky it 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.630
 here take artillery get on capture 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.360
 well, why if so much meat we have 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.840
 I shall lie in the city of the blind with gold 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.670
 charged therefore go run down the back 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.770
 rhymes 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.230
 I feel them pretty well so bombed by 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.400
 the end of the fight when they realized that their 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.800
 here would essentially diluted. 6 levels and 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.920
 while here I understand sous-152 and and long 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.470
 sleep guards t25 2 hang out dude 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.450
 unreal zadolbalo it will see it 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.120
 due to the fact that I gave him the first point 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.850
 even then I noticed so cure 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.160
 I have to fight the whole fight though now 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.620
 prokidyvat even what fourth he already 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.470
 I did not take risks because I noticed that 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.210
 from the ear right now comes into this lane and there 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.460
 I can lurk at my hunt 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.830
 left just on vanshot that is 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.740
 9 from 390 dick 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.410
 That is, there is even a minimum salary on me 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.390
 fill up and here she gape a little and 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.330
 again I want to think about 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.180
 the other thick but not knock thumps 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.010
 laying here this dude on american by 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.530
 Tashkent got a pancake specifically 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.990
 it just so happened and still retreat 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.180
 I'm not going to stream ammo 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.420
 I do a little deceptive maneuver that is 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.580
 showed as if i'm leaving and m 25 by the way 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.560
 if you succumb to me but really 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.460
 I actually made a loop and just pulled out 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.040
 back to 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.340
 and dry off by that just tricked by this 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.870
 dude and took it away and now he 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.360
 already trying to enter me 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.200
 hiding behind a lion and now doing forward 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.150
 a little bit like a jerk so he covers 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.860
 I understand that now formed without 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.350
 me here 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.300
 and in the meantime I calmly make out 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.670
 lion and you can see we fall and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.620
 someone in the tanks or engine area 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.560
 we set fire not so he 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.200
 The money box is already sent to me as a frag 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.160
 Here is such a batch I gave the city 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.930
 i think rushed for fun everything looks 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.470
 just got a lot of fun and adrenaline in 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.080
 that moment 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.150
 who liked this fight like and 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.360

 skip New vidosiki by email. we 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.790
 such a wild bend

 precisely by 59 16 because I have him there 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.710
 time used in conjunction with two tt 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.870
 level eight preferential and there 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.080
 It turned out such nice moments here 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.930
 cleanly worked as a support beside 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.360
 I think few have seen how l . can 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.040
