super super glitched out I mean that is
clearly<00:05:49.840> not<00:05:49.960> me<00:05:50.289> holding<00:05:50.620> it<00:05:50.740> man<00:05:51.520> it's<00:05:52.120> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
clearly not me holding it man it's the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.939 
clearly not me holding it man it's the
force<00:05:52.539> Iron<00:05:53.320> Man

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
force Iron Man

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.670 
force Iron Man
crossed<00:05:54.460> with<00:05:54.669> Yoda<00:05:54.940> equals<00:05:55.810> cargo<00:05:56.470> plane

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
crossed with Yoda equals cargo plane

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.250 
crossed with Yoda equals cargo plane
carrying<00:05:57.099> that's<00:05:57.400> what<00:05:57.550> eyes<00:05:57.699> oh<00:05:58.000> boy

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
right so I guess now we do the jump

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.550 
right so I guess now we do the jump
thing<00:06:02.680> and<00:06:02.919> see<00:06:03.280> if<00:06:03.580> we<00:06:04.060> can<00:06:04.240> fly<00:06:04.659> this<00:06:05.380> is

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
thing and see if we can fly this is

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.470 
thing and see if we can fly this is
clearly<00:06:05.800> gonna<00:06:06.010> work<00:06:06.219> I<00:06:06.520> feel<00:06:06.669> like<00:06:06.820> this<00:06:06.940> is

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
clearly gonna work I feel like this is

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.780 
clearly gonna work I feel like this is
Kerbal<00:06:07.810> space<00:06:07.840> program<00:06:08.280> with<00:06:09.280> like<00:06:09.490> kind<00:06:09.730> of

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
Kerbal space program with like kind of

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.820 
Kerbal space program with like kind of
testing<00:06:10.180> right<00:06:10.330> let's<00:06:10.540> give<00:06:10.630> this<00:06:10.660> a<00:06:10.840> go<00:06:10.870> run

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
testing right let's give this a go run

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.400 
testing right let's give this a go run
and<00:06:12.280> jump<00:06:12.910> oh<00:06:13.410> oh<00:06:14.610> oh<00:06:15.610> my<00:06:16.540> god<00:06:16.720> this<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.170> cool
