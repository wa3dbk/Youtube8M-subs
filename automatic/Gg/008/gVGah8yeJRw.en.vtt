hard to believe it's hard to buy it's
hard<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.640> me<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> believe<00:00:17.940> anyway<00:00:18.510> because<00:00:19.410> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
hard for me to believe anyway because I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.359 
hard for me to believe anyway because I
look<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.250> our<00:00:20.580> past<00:00:20.880> three<00:00:21.270> years<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
look it back on our past three years and

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.980 
look it back on our past three years and
what<00:00:23.369> Congress<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.150> done<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.810> has

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
what Congress has done what if it has

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.040 
what Congress has done what if it has
done<00:00:25.199> we've<00:00:25.439> literally<00:00:25.740> injected<00:00:26.779> about<00:00:27.779> five

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
done we've literally injected about five

done we've literally injected about five
point<00:00:28.380> three<00:00:28.470> trillion<00:00:29.010> dollars<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.269> don't

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
point three trillion dollars and I don't

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
point three trillion dollars and I don't
think<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.199> much<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
think we got very much for it the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
think we got very much for it the
national<00:00:32.369> debt<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> went<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.059> five<00:00:33.450> point<00:00:33.750> one

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
national debt it went up five point one

trillion dollars real gdp grew less than
one<00:00:38.910> percent<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> don't<00:00:40.590> think<00:00:40.800> we've

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
one percent so I don't think we've

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
one percent so I don't think we've
gotten<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.520> whole<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:41.809> unemployment<00:00:42.809> really

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gotten a whole lot unemployment really

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.190 
gotten a whole lot unemployment really
hasn't<00:00:43.290> recovered<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:44.040> still<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:45.200> seven

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
hasn't recovered we still have seven

million people that have become

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.279 
million people that have become
unemployed<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.390> one<00:00:51.390> statistic<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
unemployed and one statistic that is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
unemployed and one statistic that is
very<00:00:52.530> glaring<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> chart<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
very glaring if you look at the chart is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
very glaring if you look at the chart is
how<00:00:54.329> long<00:00:54.539> people<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.230> unemployed<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
how long people are unemployed the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
how long people are unemployed the
average<00:00:56.399> time<00:00:56.610> used<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.969> 17<00:00:57.480> weeks<00:00:57.719> now

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
average time used to be 17 weeks now

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.450 
average time used to be 17 weeks now
it's<00:00:58.109> nearly<00:00:58.320> 40<00:00:58.829> weeks<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.250> stay

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's nearly 40 weeks they stay

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's nearly 40 weeks they stay
unemployed<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.660> nothing<00:01:01.050> there<00:01:01.230> reassures<00:01:01.890> me

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
unemployed so nothing there reassures me

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
unemployed so nothing there reassures me
and<00:01:03.019> also<00:01:04.640> when<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.060> talk<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.360> prices

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and also when when we talk about prices

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.899 
and also when when we talk about prices
we're<00:01:07.590> always<00:01:07.770> reassure<00:01:08.280> there's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.760> all

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
we're always reassure there's not all

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.990 
we're always reassure there's not all
that<00:01:08.939> much<00:01:09.150> inflation<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.610> told

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that much inflation and and we're told

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.550 
that much inflation and and we're told
that<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.330> might<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:13.110> calculating

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that they might start calculating

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
that they might start calculating
inflation<00:01:14.369> differently<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> new<00:01:15.210> new<00:01:15.360> CPI

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
inflation differently with a new new CPI

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
inflation differently with a new new CPI
of<00:01:16.200> course<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.530> changed<00:01:16.830> our<00:01:16.920> CPI<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.400> few<00:01:17.640> years

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of course we changed our CPI a few years

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
of course we changed our CPI a few years
back<00:01:18.090> there's<00:01:18.869> still<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> free<00:01:19.409> market<00:01:19.619> group

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
back there's still a free market group

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
back there's still a free market group
that<00:01:20.220> calculates<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> CPI<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that calculates the CPI the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
that calculates the CPI the
old-fashioned<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.939> come<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.270> with

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
old-fashioned way and they come up with

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.420 
old-fashioned way and they come up with
a<00:01:24.420> figure<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:25.020> white<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> weak

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
a figure it's white of all this weak

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.359 
a figure it's white of all this weak

year<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.729> went

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
year and and I think if you just went

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.609 
year and and I think if you just went
out<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.210> talked<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> average<00:01:33.990> housewife

out and talked to the average housewife

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
out and talked to the average housewife
she'd<00:01:35.100> probably<00:01:35.280> believe<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.150> nine

she'd probably believe this the nine

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
she'd probably believe this the nine
percent<00:01:37.110> rather<00:01:37.409> than<00:01:37.590> saying<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.100> only

percent rather than saying it's only

percent rather than saying it's only

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
only two percent so I would say what

only two percent so I would say what

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
trouble but my question is if you took

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.490 
trouble but my question is if you took
that<00:02:29.920> five<00:02:30.400> point<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:30.790> trillion<00:02:31.300> dollars<00:02:31.810> and

that five point one trillion dollars and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100 
that five point one trillion dollars and

the reason people hold gold is as a

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.090 
the reason people hold gold is as a

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
the extent that the last few years have
