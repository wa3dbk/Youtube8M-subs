technique changes kind of like similar
to<00:00:59.339> phantom<00:01:00.339> limb<00:01:00.519> where<00:01:00.909> you<00:01:01.000> play<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.239> same

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
to phantom limb where you play the same

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.610 
to phantom limb where you play the same
progression<00:01:01.600> but<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.140> do<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.440> little

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
progression but you do it a little

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.380 
progression but you do it a little
differently<00:01:02.949> as<00:01:03.070> far<00:01:03.250> as<00:01:03.399> sliding<00:01:03.909> and

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
differently as far as sliding and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.760 
differently as far as sliding and
something<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.899> know<00:01:04.989> summer<00:01:05.320> play<00:01:05.560> staccato

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
something you know summer play staccato

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.889 
something you know summer play staccato
so<00:01:06.640> I'm<00:01:06.790> sure<00:01:07.000> you'll<00:01:07.149> be<00:01:07.300> able<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.509> recognize
