00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
everything is gone now and why would I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.690 
everything is gone now and why would I
have<00:02:16.890> all<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.220> threads<00:02:17.459> stone<00:02:18.049> here<00:02:19.430> okay<00:02:20.430> so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
have all the threads stone here okay so

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
have all the threads stone here okay so
are<00:02:20.970> guessing<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.900> how<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.230> works<00:02:24.590> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
are guessing this is how it works this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.819 
are guessing this is how it works this
has<00:02:26.010> well<00:02:26.910> I'll<00:02:27.120> say<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:27.930> first<00:02:28.320> first<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
has well I'll say this first first you

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.710 
has well I'll say this first first you
can<00:02:29.010> only<00:02:29.160> use<00:02:29.280> these<00:02:29.730> blocks<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.180> red<00:02:30.299> stuff<00:02:30.570> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
can only use these blocks of red stuff I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.240 
can only use these blocks of red stuff I
mean<00:02:31.170> wool<00:02:32.000> minus<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.120> redstone<00:02:33.769> these<00:02:34.769> look

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
mean wool minus a redstone these look

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.250 
mean wool minus a redstone these look
like<00:02:35.310> they're<00:02:37.190> pig<00:02:38.190> spawners<00:02:38.609> with<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:40.079> looks

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
like they're pig spawners with it looks

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.460 
like they're pig spawners with it looks
like<00:02:40.410> lava<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.250> mine<00:02:41.760> cart<00:02:42.079> to<00:02:43.079> make<00:02:43.290> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
like lava in the mine cart to make it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.650 
like lava in the mine cart to make it
rock<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.280> forth<00:02:44.519> with<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> bunch<00:02:45.420> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
rock back and forth with like a bunch of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.810 
rock back and forth with like a bunch of
them<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.320> they<00:02:46.380> probably<00:02:46.650> move<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.280> minecart

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
them so they probably move the minecart

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.990 
them so they probably move the minecart
to<00:02:48.420> start<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.989> sequence<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.530> them<00:02:49.709> moving<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to start the sequence of them moving and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.250 
to start the sequence of them moving and
then<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.239> looks<00:02:51.390> like<00:02:52.220> more<00:02:53.359> or<00:02:54.359> one<00:02:54.989> pic

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
then it looks like more or one pic

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.539 
then it looks like more or one pic
spawner<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:56.160> each<00:02:56.459> one<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.670> those<00:02:58.549> then

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
spawner in each one of those then

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.970 
spawner in each one of those then
redstone<00:03:00.560> redstone<00:03:01.560> redstone<00:03:02.359> that<00:03:03.359> torch

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
redstone redstone redstone that torch

forgetting it's used with a hopper that
sucks<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.000> blocks<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.600> brings<00:03:18.959> them<00:03:19.170> down

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
sucks the blocks and brings them down

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.920 
sucks the blocks and brings them down
brings<00:03:19.799> them<00:03:19.950> down<00:03:19.980> here<00:03:20.549> put<00:03:21.269> some<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.660> the

tests

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.900 

and<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.250> will<00:03:28.370> copy<00:03:28.700> these<00:03:30.100> see<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.730> is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
and it will copy these see there is

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.350 
and it will copy these see there is
stuff<00:03:32.210> in<00:03:32.450> them<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.050> colored<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:34.360> they're

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
okay and now you can see the Pistons

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.680 
okay and now you can see the Pistons
behind<00:04:15.470> where<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:17.070> gets<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:18.030> blocks<00:04:18.359> get

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
behind where it gets the blocks get

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.979 
behind where it gets the blocks get
pushed<00:04:18.989> out<00:04:19.940> see<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> Pistons<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.750> have<00:04:21.959> a

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
pushed out see the Pistons I have a

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.600 
pushed out see the Pistons I have a
texture<00:04:22.440> pack<00:04:22.620> on<00:04:22.800> that's<00:04:23.010> why<00:04:23.100> they<00:04:23.310> look<00:04:23.460> a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
texture pack on that's why they look a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.370 
texture pack on that's why they look a
little<00:04:23.729> different<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:26.510> then<00:04:27.510> they<00:04:27.900> get<00:04:28.050> push

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
little different and then they get push

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.750 
little different and then they get push
when<00:04:29.250> there<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:31.560> block<00:04:32.220> getting<00:04:32.550> pushed

out this will turn on and every block

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.610 
out this will turn on and every block
doesn't<00:04:35.340> get<00:04:35.610> pushed<00:04:35.820> out<00:04:36.030> every<00:04:36.479> row<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.380> will

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
doesn't get pushed out every row it will

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.189 
doesn't get pushed out every row it will
