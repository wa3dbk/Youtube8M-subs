hello<00:00:03.929> so<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.470> video<00:00:04.650> just<00:00:05.040> going<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.279> do

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hello so in this video just going to do

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480 
hello so in this video just going to do
a<00:00:05.670> quick<00:00:05.970> hardware<00:00:06.779> size<00:00:07.170> comparison<00:00:08.040> with

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
a quick hardware size comparison with

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.749 
a quick hardware size comparison with
the<00:00:08.820> Sony<00:00:09.269> Xperia<00:00:09.540> L<00:00:10.410> against<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the Sony Xperia L against some of the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.850 
the Sony Xperia L against some of the
other<00:00:11.940> smartphones<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.049> may<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.440> used

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
other smartphones that you may have used

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160 
other smartphones that you may have used
or<00:00:14.040> may<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.250> competing<00:00:14.969> against<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> Xperia<00:00:16.020> L

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
or may be competing against the Xperia L

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.230 
or may be competing against the Xperia L
and<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.500> want<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.920> an<00:00:17.010> idea<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and you want to have an idea of what the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380 
and you want to have an idea of what the
size<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.810> like<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.320> comparison<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.210> may

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
size is like in comparison so you may

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
size is like in comparison so you may
already<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.930> using<00:00:22.109> or<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.430> used<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> Sony

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
already be using or have used an it Sony

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.890 
already be using or have used an it Sony
Xperia<00:00:24.900> J<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.490> L<00:00:26.760> compares<00:00:27.359> quite

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
Xperia J so the L compares quite

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.830 
Xperia J so the L compares quite
similarly<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:28.980> J<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.810> see

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
similarly to the J here so you can see

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
similarly to the J here so you can see
in<00:00:31.170> terms<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> overall<00:00:31.790> profile<00:00:32.790> size<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
in terms of the overall profile size the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.260 
in terms of the overall profile size the
L<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.440> fraction<00:00:34.710> bigger<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:36.120> got

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
L is just a fraction bigger it's got

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
L is just a fraction bigger it's got
that<00:00:36.390> angular<00:00:36.780> design<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> J

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that angular design a bit like the J

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.000 
that angular design a bit like the J
itself<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> makes<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> little<00:00:40.800> bit

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
itself so it makes it that little bit

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
itself so it makes it that little bit
longer<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> curvature<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
longer you can see the curvature on the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.690 
longer you can see the curvature on the
Xperia<00:00:44.370> L<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:45.360> terms<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.809> thickness<00:00:46.700> there

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
Xperia L in terms of thickness there

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.029 
Xperia L in terms of thickness there
isn't<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> lot<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> Xperia<00:00:49.230> L<00:00:49.410> probably

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
isn't a lot in it the Xperia L probably

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.389 
isn't a lot in it the Xperia L probably
just<00:00:50.730> has<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> edge<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> we'll<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.890> compare

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
just has the edge so we'll now compare

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.560 
just has the edge so we'll now compare
the<00:00:53.699> samsung<00:00:54.449> galaxy<00:00:54.960> s3<00:00:55.199> mini<00:00:56.149> most<00:00:57.149> likely

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the samsung galaxy s3 mini most likely

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
the samsung galaxy s3 mini most likely
to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> highest<00:00:58.680> competing

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to be one of the highest competing

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
to be one of the highest competing
devices<00:00:59.460> with<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> Xperia<00:01:00.930> L<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> see

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
devices with the Xperia L so you can see

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
devices with the Xperia L so you can see
you've<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.730> complete<00:01:03.149> different<00:01:03.629> form

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you've got a complete different form

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
you've got a complete different form
factor<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.890> more<00:01:05.159> curvature<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
factor much more curvature to the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.260 
factor much more curvature to the
corners<00:01:06.479> they're<00:01:06.720> giving<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> El<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.670> more

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
corners they're giving the El much more

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.010 
corners they're giving the El much more
angular<00:01:09.659> finish<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:11.340> terms<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.939> thickness<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
angular finish in terms of thickness the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.980 
angular finish in terms of thickness the
s3<00:01:13.710> mini<00:01:13.740> probably<00:01:14.729> has<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.570> slightly

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
s3 mini probably has it just slightly

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.249 
s3 mini probably has it just slightly
albeit<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.250> Xperia<00:01:17.790> L<00:01:17.939> feels<00:01:18.420> slimmer<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
albeit the Xperia L feels slimmer in the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
albeit the Xperia L feels slimmer in the
hand<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> curvature<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
hand because of the curvature to the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.100 
hand because of the curvature to the
back<00:01:22.350> part<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.030> phone<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.930> see

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
back part of the phone so you can see

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
back part of the phone so you can see
how<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.320> profile<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.280> changes<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
how that profile really changes there in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
how that profile really changes there in
terms<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.290> weight<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.070> L<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.729> feels<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
terms of weight the L just feels that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
terms of weight the L just feels that
little<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.689> heavier<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:31.979> maybe

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
little bit heavier as well maybe

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.910 
little bit heavier as well maybe
slightly<00:01:33.299> older<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:33.780> different<00:01:34.170> devices<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
slightly older all different devices the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.420 
slightly older all different devices the
blackberry<00:01:35.340> bold<00:01:35.780> 9700<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
blackberry bold 9700 you can see how the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.969 
blackberry bold 9700 you can see how the
form<00:01:38.820> factor<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.299> considerably<00:01:39.869> different

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
form factor is considerably different

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.969 
form factor is considerably different
much<00:01:40.979> squarer<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.060> L<00:01:42.390> than<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> 9700<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
much squarer is the L than the 9700 of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
much squarer is the L than the 9700 of
course<00:01:44.250> you've<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> touch<00:01:45.060> screen<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
course you've got the touch screen and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
course you've got the touch screen and
you<00:01:45.689> haven't<00:01:46.079> got<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> physical<00:01:46.829> keyboard

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you haven't got the physical keyboard

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
you haven't got the physical keyboard
but<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.450> how<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> thickness

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
but you can see how the thickness

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 
but you can see how the thickness
compares<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.640> ales<00:01:50.880> much<00:01:51.210> thinner<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
compares the ales much thinner but it is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.700 
compares the ales much thinner but it is
of<00:01:52.140> course<00:01:52.350> taller<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.970> terms<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> weight

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
of course taller and in terms of weight

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.340 
of course taller and in terms of weight
very<00:01:55.710> similar<00:01:56.250> indeed<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.450> those<00:01:57.659> two<00:01:57.960> devices

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
very similar indeed on those two devices

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.959 
very similar indeed on those two devices
we<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.549> here<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> HTC<00:02:01.170> 8x<00:02:01.850> ok<00:02:02.850> it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
we also have here the HTC 8x ok it's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
we also have here the HTC 8x ok it's
running<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> different<00:02:03.479> operating<00:02:03.990> system<00:02:04.259> but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
running a different operating system but

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.029

you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.369> how<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> size<00:02:06.590> compares<00:02:07.590> there

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
you can see how the size compares there

you can see how the size compares there
there<00:02:08.640> isn't<00:02:09.060> an<00:02:09.209> awful<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:11.250> with

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
of thickness you know the ax probably

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.200

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.930 
has it just about there it's got
curvature<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.110> sort<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.470> side<00:02:29.820> profile<00:02:30.820> of

very<00:02:37.900> similar<00:02:38.230> probably<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.190> ax<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.240> the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
very similar probably the ax is just the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.220 
very similar probably the ax is just the
slightly<00:02:41.470> heavier<00:02:41.920> unit<00:02:42.570> here<00:02:43.570> we've<00:02:43.690> got<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
slightly heavier unit here we've got the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.400 
slightly heavier unit here we've got the
iphone<00:02:44.830> 4<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.690> might<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:46.960> one<00:02:47.230> that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
iphone 4 so this might be one that

impressions<00:04:09.459> suggest<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> s2<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.170> thinner

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
impressions suggest the s2 is thinner

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.570 
impressions suggest the s2 is thinner
the<00:04:12.940> s2<00:04:13.270> of<00:04:13.450> course<00:04:13.720> was<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> very<00:04:14.200> popular

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
the s2 of course was a very popular

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.400 
the s2 of course was a very popular
phone<00:04:15.580> indeed<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.209> still<00:04:16.480> remains<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.080> one

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
phone indeed and still remains to be one

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.580 
phone indeed and still remains to be one
but<00:04:18.250> quite<00:04:18.489> comparable<00:04:19.120> in<00:04:19.600> terms<00:04:20.230> of<00:04:20.410> its

but quite comparable in terms of its

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.730

physical<00:04:21.010> size<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.609> weight<00:04:22.330> probably<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.229> s2

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
physical size and weight probably the s2

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.370 
physical size and weight probably the s2
is<00:04:23.979> just<00:04:24.370> fractionally<00:04:24.820> heavier

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
is just fractionally heavier

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.530 
is just fractionally heavier
so<00:04:25.830> that's<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.250> quick<00:04:26.460> Hardware<00:04:27.300> size

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
so that's a quick Hardware size
