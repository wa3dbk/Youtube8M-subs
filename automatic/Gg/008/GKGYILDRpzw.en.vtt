a say like a Scots are no lanes or
something<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.399> also<00:01:47.399> switched<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.299> new

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
something I also switched out the new

simply<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:53.420> plastic<00:01:54.420> ones<00:01:54.720> aren't

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
simply because the plastic ones aren't

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.690 
simply because the plastic ones aren't
very<00:01:56.329> attractive<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.479> my<00:01:57.630> opinion<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.700> that's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
very attractive in my opinion but that's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.880 
very attractive in my opinion but that's
just<00:01:59.969> cosmetic<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.880> billet

clutch and brake levers pazzo racing
they're<00:02:09.979> very<00:02:10.979> nice<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.690> shorty

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
