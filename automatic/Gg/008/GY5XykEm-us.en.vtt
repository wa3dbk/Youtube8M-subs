my<00:00:10.710> model<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.210> hole<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> perimeter<00:00:13.980> line

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
my model is a hole in the perimeter line

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.500 
my model is a hole in the perimeter line
this<00:00:14.969> happens<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.839> lot<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.920> haircutting<00:00:17.670> I'm

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this happens a lot and haircutting I'm

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.900 
this happens a lot and haircutting I'm
going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.900> show<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:19.770> trick<00:00:20.070> that

going to show you one little trick that
will<00:00:21.090> help<00:00:21.150> save<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.529> perimeter

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
will help save the perimeter

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
will help save the perimeter
traditionally<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.560> taught<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.849> section

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
traditionally we are taught to section

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
traditionally we are taught to section
the<00:00:27.599> hair<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.960> four<00:00:28.230> quadrants<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:29.400> top

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the hair in the four quadrants from top

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.749 
the hair in the four quadrants from top
of<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.880> ear<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.570> top<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.019> ear<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.759> then

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
of the ear to top of the ear and then

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.889 
of the ear to top of the ear and then
from<00:00:33.120> front<00:00:33.719> Center<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.290> back<00:00:34.860> Center<00:00:35.719> when<00:00:36.719> we

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
from front Center to back Center when we

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.130 
from front Center to back Center when we
do<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.790> what<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.940> end<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.270> doing<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.750> cutting

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
do this what we end up doing is cutting

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.160 
do this what we end up doing is cutting
the<00:00:43.340> part<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> perimeter<00:00:45.000> from<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> side

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the part of the perimeter from the side

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.660 
the part of the perimeter from the side
hairline<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.690> part<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.770> back<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.520> I'm

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
hairline as part of the back and I'm

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:08.899 
hairline as part of the back and I'm
going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.940> demonstrate<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.750> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.630 

so<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.899> have<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.409> hair<00:01:10.590> parted<00:01:11.100> from<00:01:11.369> top

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
so here we have the hair parted from top

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.560 
so here we have the hair parted from top
of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> ear<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.899> top<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> ear

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
of the ear to top of the ear

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.510 
of the ear to top of the ear
when<00:01:16.230> we<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.910> cutting<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.010> we've<00:01:20.010> cut<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
when we are now cutting and we've cut a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.590 
when we are now cutting and we've cut a
perimeter<00:01:20.940> line<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.380> back<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.360> work

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
perimeter line in the back and we work

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400 
perimeter line in the back and we work
up<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:25.110> head<00:01:25.290> shape<00:01:26.120> if<00:01:27.120> we<00:01:27.480> have<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> parted

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
up the head shape if we have it parted

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.310 
up the head shape if we have it parted
like<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.540> we<00:01:30.540> work<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.260> head

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.149 

and<00:01:36.440> maybe<00:01:37.070> we<00:01:37.340> start<00:01:37.850> layering<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:39.020> here

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.670 

we<00:01:43.090> will<00:01:43.299> include<00:01:43.990> this<00:01:44.530> as<00:01:44.890> back<00:01:45.759> as<00:01:46.590> part<00:01:47.590> of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
we will include this as back as part of

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.609 
we will include this as back as part of
the<00:01:48.009> back<00:01:48.460> hairline<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.580 

we'll<00:01:57.340> cut<00:01:57.609> this<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.270> what<00:01:58.450> happens<00:01:58.929> is<00:01:59.200> this

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
we'll cut this and what happens is this

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.610 
we'll cut this and what happens is this
falls

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
falls

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.140 
falls
here<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.640> creates<00:02:03.120> that<00:02:03.600> hole

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.270 

if<00:02:06.570> you'll<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.440> little<00:02:07.650> thing<00:02:07.980> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
if you'll do this one little thing and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.280 
if you'll do this one little thing and
instead<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> parting<00:02:09.479> from<00:02:09.600> top<00:02:09.900> of<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.080> ear

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
instead of parting from top of the ear

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
instead of parting from top of the ear
to<00:02:10.320> top<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.010> ear<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:13.520> instead<00:02:14.520> part<00:02:15.120> where

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
to top of the ear and instead part where

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.700 
to top of the ear and instead part where
the<00:02:15.900> hairline<00:02:16.290> changes<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.690> all<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.260> hair

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the hairline changes so all of this hair

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.610 
the hairline changes so all of this hair
here<00:02:20.310> falls<00:02:20.730> over<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:22.530> back<00:02:22.980> hairline<00:02:24.620> this

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
here falls over this back hairline this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.580 
here falls over this back hairline this
hair<00:02:26.360> does<00:02:27.360> not<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:28.500> over<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:31.290> this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
hair does not it's over here with this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.540 
hair does not it's over here with this
hairline

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
hairline

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.020 
hairline
then<00:02:34.210> when<00:02:34.510> we're<00:02:34.720> cutting

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.360 

and<00:02:39.480> we're<00:02:39.750> working<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.830> back<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
and we're working up the back of the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.600 
and we're working up the back of the
head<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:42.420> will<00:02:42.630> not<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:43.080> including<00:02:43.830> this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
head we will not be including this

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:53.980 
head we will not be including this
perimeter<00:02:45.270> line<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:49.520> we<00:02:50.520> will<00:02:50.670> also<00:02:51.120> know

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.020 

that<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.020> need<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.380> maintain<00:02:55.740> all<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.760> this

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that I need to maintain all of this

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.170 
that I need to maintain all of this
length<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.890> part<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.010> perimeter<00:02:59.910> and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
length as part of that perimeter and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.740 
length as part of that perimeter and
then<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.900> won't<00:03:01.080> start<00:03:01.880> layering<00:03:02.880> or<00:03:03.390> building

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
then we won't start layering or building

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.140 
then we won't start layering or building
weight<00:03:03.990> or<00:03:04.140> anything<00:03:04.170> else<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.150> until

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
weight or anything else that we do until

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.330 
weight or anything else that we do until
we're<00:03:06.330> up<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.290> save<00:03:07.709> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
we're up in here and we save that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.080 
we're up in here and we save that
perimeter<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:10.980> little<00:03:11.160> simple<00:03:11.489> thing<00:03:11.850> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
perimeter so one little simple thing I
