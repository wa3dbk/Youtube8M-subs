00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.370 

I<00:03:54.340> should<00:03:55.340> do<00:03:55.520> something<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:56.120> will<00:03:57.020> start<00:03:57.290> a

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
I should do something I will start a

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.820 
I should do something I will start a
download<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.420> will<00:03:59.570> be<00:04:00.230> faster<00:04:00.710> I<00:04:00.800> think

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
download so this will be faster I think

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.160 
download so this will be faster I think
I'm<00:04:01.190> mind<00:04:01.490> could<00:04:01.760> already<00:04:01.880> got<00:04:02.270> it<00:04:02.420> might<00:04:03.020> be

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
I'm mind could already got it might be

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:12.630 
I'm mind could already got it might be
wrong<00:04:06.280> but<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:08.120> patient<00:04:08.570> will<00:04:08.720> be<00:04:08.750> worth<00:04:08.990> it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.890 

so<00:04:13.640> what<00:04:13.820> I've<00:04:13.940> learned<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.480> more<00:04:14.690> active

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
so what I've learned is the more active

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.590 
so what I've learned is the more active
peers<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.680> have<00:04:15.860> them<00:04:16.190> faster<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.239> download

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
peers you have them faster the download

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.840 
peers you have them faster the download
speed<00:04:17.720> will<00:04:18.019> be<00:04:21.340> because<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.520> more<00:04:22.760> active

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
speed will be because of the more active

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.380 
speed will be because of the more active
peers<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.420> can<00:04:23.570> download<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.080> films<00:04:24.620> from<00:04:25.390> so

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
just as I say just give it to mount a

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.230 
just as I say just give it to mount a
buffer<00:04:37.540> for<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.570> little<00:04:39.080> bit<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:41.030> you
