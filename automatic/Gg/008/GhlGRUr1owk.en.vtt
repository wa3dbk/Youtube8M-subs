well so in half and then in thirds and
when<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.230> open<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.859> circle<00:00:46.219> up<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.850> are

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
when you open the circle up you are

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.189 
when you open the circle up you are
going<00:00:47.179> to<00:00:47.239> have<00:00:47.390> something<00:00:47.870> looks<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:48.170> a

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
going to have something looks like a

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.919 
going to have something looks like a
wheel<00:00:48.440> with<00:00:48.829> six<00:00:49.159> spokes<00:00:49.670> put<00:00:50.449> it<00:00:50.570> back<00:00:50.719> into

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
wheel with six spokes put it back into

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.360 
wheel with six spokes put it back into
the<00:00:51.079> hole<00:00:51.199> that<00:00:51.379> you<00:00:51.499> cut<00:00:51.679> out<00:00:51.710> that's<00:00:52.219> going

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the hole that you cut out that's going

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.489 
the hole that you cut out that's going
to<00:00:52.429> be<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.550> template<00:00:52.969> for<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:53.359> then<00:00:54.350> you're

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
to be a template for you then you're

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.569 
to be a template for you then you're
going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.679> mark<00:00:54.859> off<00:00:55.039> every<00:00:55.219> other<00:00:55.760> spoke<00:00:57.579> so

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
going to mark off every other spoke so

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.980 
going to mark off every other spoke so
you<00:00:58.670> mark<00:00:58.940> one<00:01:00.399> skip<00:01:01.399> one<00:01:01.429> mark<00:01:02.059> one<00:01:04.780> skip<00:01:05.780> one

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
you mark one skip one mark one skip one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.770 
you mark one skip one mark one skip one
and<00:01:06.140> mark<00:01:06.710> one<00:01:07.150> so<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:08.210> end<00:01:08.330> up<00:01:08.360> with<00:01:08.510> three

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
and mark one so you end up with three

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.080 
and mark one so you end up with three
marks<00:01:09.260> on<00:01:09.409> your<00:01:09.500> paper<00:01:09.740> now<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> give<00:01:11.000> you

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
marks on your paper now just to give you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.120 
marks on your paper now just to give you
an<00:01:11.180> idea<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.450> what<00:01:12.320> you're<00:01:12.500> going<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.680> do<00:01:12.799> is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
an idea of what you're going to do is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.940 
an idea of what you're going to do is
I'm<00:01:13.729> just<00:01:13.759> going<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.350> join<00:01:15.350> up<00:01:15.530> those<00:01:15.710> lines

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
I'm just going to join up those lines

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.709 
I'm just going to join up those lines
with<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.189> Pens<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.299> see<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.630> it

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
with the Pens you can see that it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.980 
with the Pens you can see that it
actually<00:01:17.990> forms<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.560> triangle<00:01:19.689> that<00:01:20.689> has<00:01:20.750> even

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
actually forms a triangle that has even

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.260 
actually forms a triangle that has even
sides<00:01:21.700> equilateral<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:22.789> think<00:01:22.969> that<00:01:23.119> with

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
sides equilateral I think that with

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.999 
sides equilateral I think that with
Rakhal<00:01:23.659> if<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:23.930> remember<00:01:24.320> from<00:01:24.439> geometry<00:01:24.649> in

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
Rakhal if I remember from geometry in

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.249 
Rakhal if I remember from geometry in
school<00:01:25.270> there<00:01:26.270> we<00:01:26.329> go<00:01:26.479> we<00:01:26.659> marked<00:01:26.930> up<00:01:27.049> three

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
school there we go we marked up three

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.389 
school there we go we marked up three
places<00:01:27.680> now<00:01:28.579> your<00:01:29.210> Christmas<00:01:29.570> cards<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.399> save

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
places now your Christmas cards I save

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.889 
places now your Christmas cards I save
all<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.700> Christmas<00:01:32.030> cards<00:01:32.299> I<00:01:32.390> get<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.689> I<00:01:32.719> had<00:01:32.869> a

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
all the Christmas cards I get so I had a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.899 
all the Christmas cards I get so I had a
gigantic<00:01:33.380> stack<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.920> them<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.430> what<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.579> did<00:01:34.759> is

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
gigantic stack of them so what I did is

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.639 
gigantic stack of them so what I did is
I<00:01:35.000> went<00:01:35.180> through<00:01:35.360> them<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:35.689> pulled<00:01:36.289> out<00:01:36.439> all

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
I went through them and pulled out all

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.230 
I went through them and pulled out all
the<00:01:36.740> ones<00:01:36.920> with<00:01:37.009> similar<00:01:37.369> color<00:01:37.579> themes<00:01:37.909> in

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the ones with similar color themes in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.870 
the ones with similar color themes in
this<00:01:38.359> particular<00:01:38.719> case<00:01:39.109> I<00:01:39.409> picked<00:01:40.159> blue<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:40.820> I

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
this particular case I picked blue so I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.920 
this particular case I picked blue so I
picked<00:01:41.119> all<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.359> cards<00:01:41.689> that<00:01:41.810> had

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
picked all the cards that had

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.289 
picked all the cards that had
predominantly<00:01:42.560> blue<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.890> them<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.299> then

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
predominantly blue in them and then

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.969 
predominantly blue in them and then
you're<00:01:44.450> simply<00:01:44.750> going<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:44.960> cut<00:01:45.170> out<00:01:45.289> 20

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
you're simply going to cut out 20

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.760 
you're simply going to cut out 20
circles<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.180> if<00:01:48.079> there's<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> little<00:01:48.500> detail

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
circles and if there's a little detail

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.050 
circles and if there's a little detail
that<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.070> like<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.399> put<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:49.670> right<00:01:49.820> dead

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
that you like to put it right dead

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.789 
that you like to put it right dead
center<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:50.990> if<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> want<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.469> see<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.710> on

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
center so that if you want to see it on

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.330 
center so that if you want to see it on
the<00:01:51.890> ornament<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:54.469> best<00:01:54.740> thing<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.009> use<00:01:55.219> for

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
the ornament the best thing to use for

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.880 
the ornament the best thing to use for
this<00:01:55.609> would<00:01:55.939> be<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.270> hole<00:01:56.509> punch<00:01:56.890> probably

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
this would be a hole punch probably

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.830 
this would be a hole punch probably
anywhere<00:01:58.219> between<00:01:58.460> one<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.420> half<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.780> two

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
anywhere between one and a half and two

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.929 
anywhere between one and a half and two
inches<00:02:00.229> would<00:02:00.439> be<00:02:00.500> perfect<00:02:00.979> size<00:02:01.310> for<00:02:01.640> an

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939

be the ideal thing so there's all 20 of
them<00:02:10.160> with<00:02:10.399> similar<00:02:10.610> color<00:02:11.000> themes<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.660> I'm

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
them with similar color themes and I'm

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.620 
them with similar color themes and I'm
going<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.020> put<00:02:12.110> those<00:02:12.200> aside<00:02:13.090> now<00:02:14.090> take<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
going to put those aside now take the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.600 
going to put those aside now take the
template<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.110> made<00:02:15.290> put<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> circle<00:02:16.250> back<00:02:16.370> in

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
template you made put the circle back in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.180 
template you made put the circle back in
take<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> straight<00:02:17.750> edge<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.170> then<00:02:18.470> fold<00:02:18.800> up<00:02:18.980> at

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
take a straight edge and then fold up at

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.370 
take a straight edge and then fold up at
the<00:02:20.120> spot<00:02:20.360> where

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
the spot where

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.800 
the spot where
the<00:02:21.440> two<00:02:21.620> marks<00:02:21.920> meet<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.630> see<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:24.050> I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.690 

make<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> second<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.410> with<00:02:30.590> green<00:02:30.890> you'll<00:02:31.460> see

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
make a second one with green you'll see

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000 
make a second one with green you'll see
after<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:33.290> find<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.650> best<00:02:33.770> thing<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
after this and I find the best thing to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.100 
after this and I find the best thing to
do<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.160> put<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.550> straightedge<00:02:35.060> down<00:02:35.360> take

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
do is put the straightedge down take

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.530 
do is put the straightedge down take
something<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.160> scoring<00:02:37.640> tool<00:02:37.670> or<00:02:38.210> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
something like a scoring tool or the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.690 
something like a scoring tool or the
back<00:02:38.780> end<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.470> pair<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.710> scissors<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.220> score

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
back end of a pair of scissors and score

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.080 
back end of a pair of scissors and score
the<00:02:40.820> paper<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.240> will<00:02:41.330> fold<00:02:41.570> better<00:02:43.090> but

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
the paper it will fold better but

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.060 
the paper it will fold better but
ultimately<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.140> all<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:45.830> is

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
ultimately this is all you have to do is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.950 
ultimately this is all you have to do is
just<00:02:46.580> you're<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.030> fold<00:02:47.240> up<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.630> circle

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
just you're going to fold up the circle

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.540 
just you're going to fold up the circle
in<00:02:48.080> three<00:02:48.260> places<00:02:48.470> using<00:02:48.890> those<00:02:49.160> little<00:02:49.340> marks

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
in three places using those little marks

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.360 
in three places using those little marks
as<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> guide<00:02:50.830> now<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.920> put<00:02:52.130> them<00:02:52.250> together

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
as a guide now to put them together

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.370 
as a guide now to put them together
you're<00:02:52.850> going<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.030> take<00:02:53.210> five<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.020> top<00:02:54.230> of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
you're going to take five for the top of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.560 
you're going to take five for the top of
the<00:02:54.470> ornament<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.240> you're<00:02:56.240> going<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.420> glue

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
the ornament and you're going to glue

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.060 
the ornament and you're going to glue
the<00:02:56.720> flaps<00:02:56.960> together<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.920> going<00:02:58.040> to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
the flaps together and you're going to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.590 
the flaps together and you're going to
make<00:02:58.250> sure<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.520> points<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> triangles<00:02:59.420> are

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
make sure the points the triangles are

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.660 
make sure the points the triangles are
facing<00:03:00.080> in<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.860> same<00:03:00.950> direction

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
facing in the same direction

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.090 
facing in the same direction
so<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.360> makes<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.660> circle<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.710> need<00:03:03.830> five

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
so it makes a circle and you need five

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.750 
so it makes a circle and you need five
of<00:03:04.340> them<00:03:05.260> but<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.380> not<00:03:06.530> glue<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.190> final<00:03:07.550> set<00:03:07.730> of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
of them but do not glue the final set of

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.870 
of them but do not glue the final set of
flaps<00:03:08.030> quite<00:03:08.360> yet<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.370> you're<00:03:10.370> do<00:03:10.490> you're

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
flaps quite yet and you're do you're

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.250 
flaps quite yet and you're do you're
going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.060> do<00:03:11.150> five<00:03:11.360> for<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.600> top<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.020> five

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
going to do five for the top and five

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.660 
going to do five for the top and five
for<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.500> bottom<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> ornament<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
for the bottom of the ornament the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.400 
for the bottom of the ornament the
center<00:03:14.030> part<00:03:14.270> of<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.420> ornament<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.230> bit

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
center part of the ornament it's a bit

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.230 
center part of the ornament it's a bit
different<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.400> center<00:03:16.730> part<00:03:16.940> you're<00:03:17.090> going

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
want a point up and then a base up and

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.190 
want a point up and then a base up and
continue<00:03:37.400> along<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.020> get<00:03:39.140> a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
continue along so that you get a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.500 
continue along so that you get a
straight<00:03:39.500> line<00:03:39.680> as<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:40.280> see<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:41.270> little

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
straight line as you can see the little

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.180 
straight line as you can see the little
baby<00:03:41.600> penguin<00:03:42.080> as<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.350> point<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:42.830> up<00:03:43.010> the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
baby penguin as the point that's up the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.490 
baby penguin as the point that's up the
next<00:03:43.430> one<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.790> base<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.180> at<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.360> top<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.780> then

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
next one the base is at the top and then

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.160 
next one the base is at the top and then
a<00:03:45.890> point<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.580> base<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.210> on<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.660> it'll

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
a point and a base and so on and it'll

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.760 
a point and a base and so on and it'll
actually<00:03:48.290> make<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.650> straight<00:03:49.010> line<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:53.770> just

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
actually make a straight line and just
