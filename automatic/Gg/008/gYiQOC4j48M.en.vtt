00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 the inevitable dessert of the holidays 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.609
 annuals what are we doing a log 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 and gibert you will offer us a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.970
 banshee easy to do all 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.800
 housewives can realize 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.809
 yes christiane today the log this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.759
 will be the icy log you need 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.190
 obviously raspberry ice cream from the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 vanilla ice cream a half white broth 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.050
 at least that will be renamed syrup of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 raspberry useful oise without forgetting the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 grid of a fetish of our confectioner 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.970
 a memory of my apprenticeship 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.070
 yes it 's gooseberry jam 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 which I did well of course and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 I put it on a bed of sponge cake in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.809
 my eyes do not misuse me about the mold he 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890
 is rather unusual the little tip a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.800
 bottle of fruit juice cut in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.110
 two a nice bottle besides 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.020
 quite thick enough and in which 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.950
 plays and where mapuche ice and that's it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.930
 cut the sponge cake 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 place it at the bottom of the mold and then soaked 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.510
 generously the biscuit with your 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.129
 raspberry syrup 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 it will be time to put your 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.410
 laframboise ice cream first when I go 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.690
 unmolding will end up on and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.150
 why do you start with raspberry 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.530
 we could start there 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.400
 actually it's a question a bit 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.680
 technique that is to say the ice that has 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.280
 trend is softer will end up 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 above for the transport of cakes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 and customers there is less risk the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.750
 vanilla is harder and the ice cream shop 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 always up on raspberry ice cream 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.579
 drop another piece of sponge cake 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.140
 soaked and then spread the famous jelly 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.210
 currant before adding ice cream 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 vanilla and close your preparation 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 with the last piece of cookies 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.770
 let the log cool 12 hours 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.010
 minimum before unmolding what is it 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.590
 the christian suite is the masking of 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.450
 the ice log the topping something 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.580
 the tablecloth here is cream chantilly 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.580
 Okay, it's gone 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 last step so the painting of 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.360
 the log with fresh whipped cream or 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.979
 bomb will not be left 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.700

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.070
