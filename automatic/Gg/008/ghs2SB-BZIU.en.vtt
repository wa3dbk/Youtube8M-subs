key section on each deck and to use it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.550 
key section on each deck and to use it
make<00:00:18.119> sure<00:00:18.150> you're<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.420> hot<00:00:18.539> key<00:00:18.720> mode<00:00:18.930> then

make sure you're in hot key mode then

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.429 
make sure you're in hot key mode then
when<00:00:19.740> tracks<00:00:19.980> playing<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.520> press<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.880> B<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.180> C

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
when tracks playing just press a B and C

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.960 
when tracks playing just press a B and C
so<00:00:24.650> when<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.740> record<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.430> buttons<00:00:26.849> will

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
so when they record is the buttons will

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.040 
so when they record is the buttons will
light<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.800> I've<00:00:28.800> recorded<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.480> kick<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.689> hi-hat

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

light up I've recorded a kick a hi-hat
and<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.260> clap<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.730> what<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.880> then<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and a clap so what we can then do is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.280 
and a clap so what we can then do is
when<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> track<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.600> playing<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.079> just

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
when the track is playing we can just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.540 
when the track is playing we can just
press<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> these<00:00:37.680> buttons<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.219> instantly

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
press one of these buttons and instantly

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.410 
press one of these buttons and instantly
it<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:38.700> jump<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> point<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.390> track

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420

so<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.140> SEVIS<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.100> r1<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.760> save

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
so when you do SEVIS the r1 will save

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.229 
so when you do SEVIS the r1 will save
them<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.170> use<00:00:49.200> CDs<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.730> save<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
them if you use CDs it will save them to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.520 
them if you use CDs it will save them to
the<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.449> ones<00:00:51.629> memory<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> will<00:00:52.379> save

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the are ones memory and that will save

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.560 
the are ones memory and that will save
three<00:00:52.920> cue<00:00:53.219> points<00:00:53.520> per<00:00:53.730> CD<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> a

scrub<00:01:40.710> through<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.009> track<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> find<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
scrub through the track and find the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.680 
scrub through the track and find the
exact<00:01:42.329> point<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.689> won<00:01:44.720> so

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.490 

so<00:01:51.690> let's<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> set<00:01:52.320> there

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so let's we're going to set there

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.290 
so let's we're going to set there
because<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.370> when<00:01:53.520> they<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.150> been

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
because the are when they have been

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.540 
because the are when they have been
saved<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.780> USB<00:01:55.530> key<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:56.340> take

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
saved to the USB key I can then take

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.080
