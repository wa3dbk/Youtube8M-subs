of the horse then you're going to

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.419 
of the horse then you're going to

stifle okay and and obviously when we
look<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.350> horses<00:00:49.739> we're<00:00:49.890> never<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> see

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
look at horses we're never going to see

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
look at horses we're never going to see
a<00:00:50.879> perfect<00:00:51.420> square<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.469> filling<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
a perfect square but filling in all of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.150 
a perfect square but filling in all of
those<00:00:53.640> ok<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> horse<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> fairly

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
those ok but this horse here is a fairly

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.490 
those ok but this horse here is a fairly
good<00:00:56.399> example<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> horse<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.660> shows<00:00:58.230> some

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
good example of a horse that shows some

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
good example of a horse that shows some
fullness<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> hip<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.420> generally

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
fullness and is hip and generally

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
fullness and is hip and generally
speaking<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.649> say<00:01:02.030> has<00:01:03.030> some

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
speaking what we would say has some

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
speaking what we would say has some
fullness<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> lower<00:01:04.140> third<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> his<00:01:04.920> hip

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
fullness in the lower third of his hip

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.080 
fullness in the lower third of his hip
and<00:01:05.400> has<00:01:05.909> adequate<00:01:06.450> length<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.049> his<00:01:07.560> hip<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
and has adequate length of his hip in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.330 
and has adequate length of his hip in
comparison<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> rest<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> his<00:01:09.840> body<00:01:10.340> okay

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
comparison to the rest of his body okay

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
comparison to the rest of his body okay
and<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.900> horse<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:14.330> for<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.869> our

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and so this horse right here for for our

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.950 
and so this horse right here for for our
purposes<00:01:16.530> today<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.000> certainly<00:01:18.240> evaluate

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
purposes today we can certainly evaluate

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
purposes today we can certainly evaluate
his<00:01:19.170> balance<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.860> say<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.549> he's<00:01:20.729> adequately

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
his balance and say that he's adequately

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.200 
his balance and say that he's adequately
balanced<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> pretty

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
balanced and and we can have a pretty

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
balanced and and we can have a pretty
good<00:01:24.450> idea<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:25.049> how<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.799> horse<00:01:26.100> should<00:01:26.280> move

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
good idea of how this horse should move

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
good idea of how this horse should move
out<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.909> track<00:01:27.240> when<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.570> watch<00:01:27.780> him<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
out and track when we watch him on the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
out and track when we watch him on the
lunge<00:01:28.439> line<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> we'll<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> ability<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
lunge line and we'll get the ability to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.260 
lunge line and we'll get the ability to
see<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.619> little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.890> ok<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
see that here in a little bit ok the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
see that here in a little bit ok the
last<00:01:33.299> thing<00:01:33.689> I'd<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> talk<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:34.680> then

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
last thing I'd like to talk about then

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
last thing I'd like to talk about then
in<00:01:35.250> terms<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> balance<00:01:36.090> using<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.570> horse<00:01:36.840> as

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
in terms of balance using this horse as

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.569 
in terms of balance using this horse as
a<00:01:37.049> model<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> depth<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:40.579> art

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
a model it is the depth of this art

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.790 
a model it is the depth of this art

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
the blanket to the horses elbow we'd

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.240 
the blanket to the horses elbow we'd
start<00:01:53.830> what<00:01:54.370> it<00:01:54.520> like<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:55.030> see<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.560> same

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
start what it like to see the the same

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.960 
start what it like to see the the same

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.420 
or greater length in this horse's heart
girth<00:02:01.240> then<00:02:01.900> we<00:02:02.050> would<00:02:02.290> from<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.070> point<00:02:03.340> of

the elbow to the ground and in this

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.920 
the elbow to the ground and in this

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
animal as we stand back we can certainly

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.950 
animal as we stand back we can certainly
see<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:08.590> he's<00:02:09.190> got<00:02:09.430> an<00:02:09.729> adequate<00:02:10.510> depth<00:02:10.780> of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
see that he's got an adequate depth of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.960 
see that he's got an adequate depth of
heart<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.470> comparison<00:02:12.190> from<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:12.640> point

straight<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.540> ground<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.410> other<00:02:14.560> thing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
straight to the ground the other thing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.710 
straight to the ground the other thing
that<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.070> can<00:02:15.250> certainly<00:02:15.490> look<00:02:15.880> at<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.300> we

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
that we can certainly look at is we

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.270 
that we can certainly look at is we
would<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> difference<00:02:17.950> or<00:02:18.220> a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
would like to see a difference or a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.180

tapering in that horses underline as you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.890 
tapering in that horses underline as you
move<00:02:21.370> back<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.910> as<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.330> evaluate<00:02:22.870> that

horses depth of heart you can come back
to<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:25.900> area<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.890> we're<00:02:27.070> still<00:02:27.340> at

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
to see in this area that we're still at

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.230 
to see in this area that we're still at
a<00:02:27.520> ratio<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:28.360> approximately<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:29.200> 2<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> 1<00:02:30.240> this

a ratio of approximately a 2 to a 1 this

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.470 
a ratio of approximately a 2 to a 1 this
horse<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.750> does<00:02:32.020> show<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:33.130> great<00:02:34.030> depth<00:02:34.330> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
horse really does show a great depth of

horse really does show a great depth of
heart<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.980> has<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> nice<00:02:37.120> strong<00:02:37.540> tapering

we<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:54.910> looked<00:02:55.090> at<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.920> just<00:02:57.160> simply

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
we just looked at and we just simply

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.800 
we just looked at and we just simply
like<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.670> point<00:02:57.850> out<00:02:58.030> some<00:02:58.239> differences<00:02:58.750> in

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
like to point out some differences in

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
like to point out some differences in
the<00:02:58.959> horses<00:02:59.410> and<00:03:00.190> then<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.700> said<00:03:00.760> later

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
the horses and then like I said later

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.610 
the horses and then like I said later
we're<00:03:01.360> going<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.750> talk<00:03:01.930> about<00:03:01.959> how<00:03:02.380> these<00:03:02.560> two

start<00:03:06.520> off<00:03:06.850> up<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.200> front<00:03:08.440> half<00:03:08.650> and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
start off up here in the front half and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
start off up here in the front half and
evaluate<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.520> horse's<00:03:09.880> neck<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.420> certainly

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
evaluate the horse's neck and certainly

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.990 
evaluate the horse's neck and certainly
from<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.440> sources<00:03:11.860> midpoint<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.670> his<00:03:12.790> wither

point of his shoulder he certainly

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.190 
point of his shoulder he certainly
reaches<00:03:21.160> our<00:03:21.310> 2<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.640> 1<00:03:21.790> ratio<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.570> area<00:03:22.930> as

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
reaches our 2 to 1 ratio in that area as

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.300 
reaches our 2 to 1 ratio in that area as
we<00:03:23.830> move<00:03:24.040> when<00:03:24.190> we<00:03:24.220> talk<00:03:24.519> about<00:03:24.850> his<00:03:25.660> top-line

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
we move when we talk about his top-line

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.290 
we move when we talk about his top-line
while<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.459> horse<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> little<00:03:28.180> bit

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
while this horse is a little bit

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.449 
while this horse is a little bit
differently<00:03:28.720> shaped<00:03:29.110> than<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.040> gelding<00:03:30.250> that

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
differently shaped than the gelding that

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.440 
differently shaped than the gelding that
we<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:30.880> talked<00:03:31.120> about

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
we just talked about

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.840 
we just talked about
he<00:03:31.900> still<00:03:32.170> certainly<00:03:32.500> balances<00:03:33.070> out<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.550> so

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
he still certainly balances out and so

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.300 
he still certainly balances out and so
it's<00:03:34.750> one<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:34.959> those<00:03:35.140> situations<00:03:35.380> where<00:03:36.130> you

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
it's one of those situations where you

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.680 
it's one of those situations where you
want<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.580> be<00:03:36.670> able<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.060> look<00:03:37.239> at<00:03:37.390> different

measure his length of underline we still
certainly<00:03:57.220> see

what's going to end up happening when

what's going to end up happening when
these<00:04:29.320> horses<00:04:29.680> move<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.160> track<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.669> that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
these horses move and track is that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.240 
these horses move and track is that
we're<00:04:31.479> going<00:04:31.599> to<00:04:31.660> see<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.870> horse<00:04:32.169> here<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:33.070> has

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
we're going to see a horse here that has

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.159 
we're going to see a horse here that has
a<00:04:33.280> greater<00:04:33.610> ability<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.180> drive<00:04:34.599> from<00:04:35.020> his

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
a greater ability to drive from his

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.529 
a greater ability to drive from his
hindquarters<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.820> utilize<00:04:37.270> his

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
hindquarters and to utilize his

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.100 
hindquarters and to utilize his
hindquarters<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.340> better<00:04:39.610> extent<00:04:40.150> than<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
hindquarters to a better extent than the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.779 
hindquarters to a better extent than the
sorrel<00:04:41.440> gilding<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.919> we<00:04:42.039> that<00:04:42.520> we<00:04:42.610> saw

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
sorrel gilding that we that we saw

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.570 
sorrel gilding that we that we saw
earlier<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.380> while<00:04:44.919> this<00:04:45.070> horse<00:04:45.340> has<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
earlier and so while this horse has a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.450 
earlier and so while this horse has a
different<00:04:46.060> appearing<00:04:46.599> hip<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.620> we<00:04:48.099> can<00:04:48.280> say

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
different appearing hip and we can say

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.680 
different appearing hip and we can say
that<00:04:48.639> both<00:04:48.789> horses<00:04:49.240> are<00:04:49.389> certainly

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
that both horses are certainly

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.290 
that both horses are certainly
adequately<00:04:50.229> balanced<00:04:50.970> we'll<00:04:51.970> be<00:04:52.060> able<00:04:52.180> to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
adequately balanced we'll be able to

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.749 
adequately balanced we'll be able to
point<00:04:52.570> out<00:04:52.720> some<00:04:52.780> differences<00:04:53.289> in<00:04:53.979> how<00:04:54.580> their

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
point out some differences in how their

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.780 
point out some differences in how their
balance<00:04:55.150> affects<00:04:55.479> their
