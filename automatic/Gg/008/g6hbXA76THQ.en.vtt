this wolf is is like a super big channel
like<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.109> if<00:04:11.290> somebody<00:04:12.510> it's

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
like I I think that if somebody it's

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.259 
like I I think that if somebody it's
it's<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:14.079> like<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.590> intent<00:04:14.920> isn't<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.310> cause

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
it's it's like the intent isn't to cause

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.370 
it's it's like the intent isn't to cause
the<00:04:16.660> drama<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.079> stir<00:04:17.260> things<00:04:17.410> up<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
the drama and stir things up to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.670 
the drama and stir things up to
to<00:04:20.010> gain<00:04:20.550> a<00:04:20.580> bunch<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.000> subs<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.420> like<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:22.020> a

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
to gain a bunch of subs in like to be a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.920 
to gain a bunch of subs in like to be a
bitter<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.490> get<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:23.970> bigger<00:04:24.150> channel<00:04:24.540> but<00:04:24.900> I

I think if you expose somebody and and
show<00:04:31.410> people<00:04:31.590> who<00:04:31.830> these<00:04:32.040> people<00:04:32.370> really<00:04:32.580> are

people can appreciate that and they do
like<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.870> it's<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.200> good<00:04:37.530> thing

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
like that and and and it's a good thing

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.620 
like that and and and it's a good thing
to<00:04:37.920> do<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:39.000> double-edged<00:04:39.300> sword<00:04:39.330> for
