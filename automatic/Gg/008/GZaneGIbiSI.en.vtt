00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.740 

this<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.280> sprint<00:00:02.909> mechanics

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
this video is about sprint mechanics

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.920 
this video is about sprint mechanics
whenever<00:00:04.879> someone<00:00:05.879> learns<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.240> new<00:00:06.270> movement<00:00:06.839> I

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
whenever someone learns a new movement I

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.390 
whenever someone learns a new movement I
believe<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.350> got<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.680> break<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.069> down<00:00:08.189> into

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
believe you got to break it down into

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.690 
believe you got to break it down into
chunks<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.120> learn<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:10.260> piece<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.099> time<00:00:11.190> one

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
chunks and learn one piece at a time one

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.150 
chunks and learn one piece at a time one
chunk<00:00:12.030> at<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.210> time<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.870> whenever<00:00:13.650> I'm

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
chunk at a time and so whenever I'm

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
chunk at a time and so whenever I'm
talking<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.519> sprint<00:00:15.000> form<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:15.450> teaching

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
talking about sprint form or teaching

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.269 
talking about sprint form or teaching
someone<00:00:16.049> sprint<00:00:16.379> form<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> teach<00:00:17.130> it

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
someone sprint form I like to teach it

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
someone sprint form I like to teach it
one<00:00:17.460> chunk<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> time<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.660> piece<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> time

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
one chunk at a time one piece at a time

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.370 
one chunk at a time one piece at a time
and<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.180> video<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.960> Safa

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and so here I have this video the Safa

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.740 
and so here I have this video the Safa
pal<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.699> first<00:00:23.970> piece<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.359> want<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> talk

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
pal and the first piece I want to talk

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.439 
pal and the first piece I want to talk
to<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.260> upper<00:00:25.590> body<00:00:25.830> mechanics<00:00:26.449> so

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to you about is upper body mechanics so

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.390 
to you about is upper body mechanics so
sprint<00:00:28.199> upper<00:00:28.410> body<00:00:28.590> mechanics<00:00:28.769> notice<00:00:29.279> how

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
sprint upper body mechanics notice how

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.470 
sprint upper body mechanics notice how
his<00:00:29.519> arms<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.570> here<00:00:30.810> locked<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.260> 90<00:00:31.560> degrees

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
his arms are here locked at 90 degrees

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.880 
his arms are here locked at 90 degrees
he's<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> lock<00:00:33.899> these<00:00:34.110> wrists<00:00:34.649> he's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
he's going to lock these wrists he's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
he's going to lock these wrists he's
going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> lock<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.460> arm<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.820> 90<00:00:36.059> degrees<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
going to lock this arm at 90 degrees and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
going to lock this arm at 90 degrees and
lock<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.719> wrists<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.170> notice<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.649> his

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
