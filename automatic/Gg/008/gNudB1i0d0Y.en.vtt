 saberi uses the interpretation loosely 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.440
 for team admits 6 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:02:17.470
 and who antipasti here t left at &amp; 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:26.340
 things abo agree is the casting fed 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 the ranges find the ice is sour 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.280
 endurance to answer 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:12.730

 from mathis what me that know or 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:11.220
 the bulgarian does not do it himself 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.049
