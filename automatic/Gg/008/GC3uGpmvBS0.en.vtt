how to grow cactus cactus or cacti if

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.940 
how to grow cactus cactus or cacti if
you<00:00:09.240> have<00:00:09.360> more<00:00:09.599> than<00:00:09.690> one<00:00:09.870> plant<00:00:10.200> grow

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
you have more than one plant grow

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.310 
you have more than one plant grow
naturally<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> deserts<00:00:12.240> they're<00:00:12.960> found

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
naturally in the deserts they're found

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.640 
naturally in the deserts they're found
all<00:00:13.679> over<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.490> planet<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.630> usually<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.260> areas

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
all over the planet but usually in areas

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.670 
all over the planet but usually in areas
with<00:00:16.890> very<00:00:16.920> little<00:00:17.880> rainfall<00:00:18.529> what<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.590> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
with very little rainfall what if you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.590 
with very little rainfall what if you
live<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> northwest<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.420> can

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
live in the northwest like I do we can

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.450 
live in the northwest like I do we can
still<00:00:21.840> grow<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.320> without<00:00:22.830> living<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
still grow them without living in the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
still grow them without living in the
desert<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.539> really<00:00:24.900> well<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.289> our

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
desert they do really well in our

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.250 
desert they do really well in our
climate<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:25.980> well<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> trick<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:27.599> cacti

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
climate as well so the trick with cacti

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.950 
climate as well so the trick with cacti
is<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.859> make<00:00:29.039> sure<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.000> only<00:00:30.029> put<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.720> outside

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
is to make sure to only put them outside

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
is to make sure to only put them outside
over<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:31.980> summer<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.940> live<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> cold

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
over the summer if you live in a cold

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
over the summer if you live in a cold
climate<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.680> sure<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.010> grow<00:00:35.190> them

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
climate and make sure and grow them

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.180 
climate and make sure and grow them
inside<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.450> winter<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.829> below

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
inside in the winter if you get below

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.420 
inside in the winter if you get below
maybe<00:00:38.520> 50<00:00:39.149> degrees<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.780> night<00:00:40.020> because<00:00:40.980> they

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
maybe 50 degrees at night because they

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
maybe 50 degrees at night because they
really<00:00:41.879> don't<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> freeze<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.140> they

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
really don't want to freeze if they

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.040 
really don't want to freeze if they
freeze<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.430> lose<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.870> they're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
freeze you will lose them so they're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
freeze you will lose them so they're
very<00:00:46.079> easy<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.770> grow<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.520> put<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.879> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
very easy to grow I just put them out in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020 
very easy to grow I just put them out in
my<00:00:48.210> deck<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.110> love<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.010> hot<00:00:50.250> Sun<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
my deck and they love the hot Sun and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.350 
my deck and they love the hot Sun and
they<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> dry<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.770> between<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.579> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
they like to dry out in between and so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.170 
they like to dry out in between and so
whenever<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.960> nights<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.620> below<00:00:56.039> 50<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.820> bring

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
whenever the nights get below 50 I bring

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
whenever the nights get below 50 I bring
them<00:00:57.270> back<00:00:57.449> inside<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.949> seem<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> do

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
them back inside and they seem to do

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
them back inside and they seem to do
really<00:00:59.760> well<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.260> there's<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.710> many

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
really well that way so there's so many

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.529 
really well that way so there's so many
different<00:01:02.340> ways<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.030> grow<00:01:03.329> them

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
different ways that you can grow them

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020 
different ways that you can grow them
the<00:01:04.019> key<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.439> cactus<00:01:04.739> isn't<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.790> water

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the key with cactus isn't to not water

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that you can grow them and I water this

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
that you can grow them and I water this
maybe<00:01:20.340> once<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.790> month<00:01:20.820> very<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.920> i

this small cactus I really like it's a
kind<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> euphorbia<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.350> isn't<00:01:28.790> considered

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
kind of euphorbia which isn't considered

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.929 
kind of euphorbia which isn't considered
a<00:01:30.000> true<00:01:30.450> cactus<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.189> beautiful<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
a true cactus but it's so beautiful and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.780 
a true cactus but it's so beautiful and
it'll<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.299> keep<00:01:33.509> growing<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> growing<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
it'll just keep growing and growing and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
it'll just keep growing and growing and
I<00:01:35.790> started<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I started with a little one like this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
I started with a little one like this
about<00:01:37.979> ten<00:01:38.250> years<00:01:38.430> ago<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.170> one

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
about ten years ago and the little one

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.039 
about ten years ago and the little one
now<00:01:40.650> has<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.820> transplanted<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.840> it's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
now has to be transplanted because it's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.249 
now has to be transplanted because it's
gotten<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.619> big<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:45.000> love<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:46.049> just

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
them because they're very sharp and I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to it's very sharp so I got to be so

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.730 
to it's very sharp so I got to be so
careful<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.390> overwatered<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
careful and I overwatered it so the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
careful and I overwatered it so the
mother<00:02:13.950> plant<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:14.820> started<00:02:15.300> dying<00:02:15.630> on

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
mother plant actually started dying on

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.170 
mother plant actually started dying on
me<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.380> turned<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.830> mush<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> just

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
me it just turned to mush so I just

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.690 
me it just turned to mush so I just
broke<00:02:18.450> off<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.990> top<00:02:19.230> parts<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.280> cactus

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
broke off the top parts of the cactus

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.490 
broke off the top parts of the cactus
that<00:02:20.880> still<00:02:21.120> looked<00:02:21.360> good<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:22.170> put<00:02:22.410> them

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that still looked good and I'm put them

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500 
that still looked good and I'm put them
back<00:02:22.650> down<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> dirt<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:24.210> there<00:02:24.390> now

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
back down in the dirt in there now

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.360 
back down in the dirt in there now
they're<00:02:24.750> living<00:02:25.110> even<00:02:25.560> when<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.010> think<00:02:26.250> you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
they're living even when you think you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.420 
they're living even when you think you
killed<00:02:26.610> them<00:02:26.880> half<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.270> time<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.080> still

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
killed them half the time you can still

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.130 
killed them half the time you can still
take<00:02:29.430> parts<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.240> still<00:02:30.450> alive<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.050> put

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
take parts that are still alive and put

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.570 
take parts that are still alive and put
them<00:02:31.260> back<00:02:31.410> down<00:02:31.470> into<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> dirt<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.400> they'll

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
them back down into the dirt and they'll

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.280 
them back down into the dirt and they'll
grow<00:02:32.790> again<00:02:33.090> that's<00:02:33.420> why<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.630> love<00:02:33.900> them<00:02:34.050> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
grow again that's why I love them so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.460 
grow again that's why I love them so
much<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> found<00:02:35.790> two<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.450> they<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.930> too<00:02:37.170> big

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
much so I found two if they get too big

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.320 
much so I found two if they get too big
or<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:37.860> start<00:02:38.130> falling<00:02:38.370> over<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.120> give

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
or they start falling over you can give

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.180 
or they start falling over you can give
them<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.570> little<00:02:39.690> bit<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.050> haircut<00:02:40.500> too<00:02:40.800> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
them a little bit of a haircut too and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640 
them a little bit of a haircut too and
these<00:02:41.850> are<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.450> sharp<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.050> got<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.350> so

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
these are so sharp you got to be so

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.040 
these are so sharp you got to be so
careful<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.450> when<00:02:45.960> you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
careful but like on this one when you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.850 
careful but like on this one when you
break<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.880> actually<00:02:48.120> makes<00:02:48.540> kind<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
break it it actually makes kind of a it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.760 
break it it actually makes kind of a it
gets<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.280> gooey<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.970> Elmer's<00:02:51.480> glue<00:02:51.780> so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
gets really gooey like Elmer's glue so

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.410 
gets really gooey like Elmer's glue so
the<00:02:53.070> real<00:02:53.250> danger<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.210> with

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the real danger that you have with

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.350 
the real danger that you have with
cactus<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:55.110> watering<00:02:55.710> them<00:02:55.950> too<00:02:56.160> much<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.180> when

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
cactus is watering them too much so when

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
cactus is watering them too much so when
in<00:02:57.480> doubt<00:02:57.660> don't<00:02:57.990> water<00:02:58.260> that's<00:02:58.830> been<00:02:59.040> my<00:02:59.190> rule

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
in doubt don't water that's been my rule

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.640 
in doubt don't water that's been my rule
of<00:02:59.430> thumb<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.780> only<00:03:00.990> water<00:03:01.200> them<00:03:01.440> maybe

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
of thumb and I only water them maybe

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.040 
of thumb and I only water them maybe
once<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.160> month<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> winter<00:03:03.870> time

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
once a month if that in the winter time

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.920 
once a month if that in the winter time
maybe<00:03:04.350> only<00:03:04.800> once<00:03:05.160> every<00:03:05.340> two<00:03:05.730> months<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.240> I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
maybe only once every two months and I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.480 
maybe only once every two months and I
kind<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.230> look<00:03:07.410> at<00:03:07.560> them<00:03:07.740> or<00:03:07.860> put<00:03:08.040> my<00:03:08.130> finger

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
kind of look at them or put my finger

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.940 
kind of look at them or put my finger
into<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.790> dirt<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:10.080> kind<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:10.680> if

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
into the dirt and you can kind of see if

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.250 
into the dirt and you can kind of see if
they're<00:03:11.130> wet<00:03:11.310> enough<00:03:11.610> or<00:03:11.820> not<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:12.960> want

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
they're wet enough or not you don't want

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.750 
they're wet enough or not you don't want
them<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.710> really<00:03:13.860> wet<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.340> want<00:03:14.550> them<00:03:14.640> to

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
them to be really wet you want them to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.550 
them to be really wet you want them to
be<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> little<00:03:15.120> bit<00:03:15.270> on<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.480> dry<00:03:15.630> side<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.440> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
be a little bit on the dry side so that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.610 
be a little bit on the dry side so that
they'll<00:03:16.710> do<00:03:16.890> really<00:03:17.070> well<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.900> even<00:03:18.900> if<00:03:19.440> they

they'll do really well and even if they

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.560 
they'll do really well and even if they
do<00:03:19.680> die<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.070> try<00:03:20.520> not<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> take<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.030> personally

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
do die I try not to take it personally

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.630 
do die I try not to take it personally
because<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.500> can<00:03:22.680> always<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> new<00:03:23.310> start

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
because you can always get a new start

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.430 
because you can always get a new start
off<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.090> another<00:03:24.240> one<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.900> they're<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.410> easy

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
off of another one and they're so easy

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.190 
off of another one and they're so easy
to<00:03:25.800> grow
