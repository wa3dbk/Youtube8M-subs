00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.310
 Welcome to golden life here I bring you 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.290
 another video guys and this time let's see 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.080
 a tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.759
 duplicate sand or gravel very simple and 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.160
 very compact for some time we already saw a 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.810
 sand duplicator but the truth that 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.519
 It was very big, we needed a lot 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.589
 materials we needed also 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.539
 enough space to do it and this is 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.640
 quite the opposite is a very duplicator 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.890
 simple very compact that will save us 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.570
 a lot of time in survival mode if 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.620
 we want to get sand or gravel 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.750
 gravel can serve us to make 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.490
 roads as we have seen in many 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.980
 episodes of survival and other things 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.240
 and the sand we already want to do some 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.860
 sandstone construction or 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.410
 we just need glass 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.180
 ok we go with the construction of the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.630
 duplicator guys let's make a 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.650
 kind of stairs with blocks of 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.840
 any material as you see is the 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.060
 first and second step this is the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.800
 third and we would have it in the first 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.620
 and second step we are going to put stone 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 red and next to the third one we're going to put 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.699
 an adhesive piston in the way that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.079
 you are seeing that third step what 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.159
 we're going to remove it and we're going to replace it 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.619
 by a repeater 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.210
 There you see, guys, we have it, no 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.069
 almost nothing would be missing already 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 finished the only thing we need is 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.819
 put a lever on the bottom 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.619
 of those stairs that we have made and already 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.149
 we would have it we just put a 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.709
 block of sand or gravel what 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.899
 We want to duplicate and we would have it 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:27.569
 just as you see does not occupy space are 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.729
 four blocks long let's say and of 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.229
 only one width can be made in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.049
 any time and as I say better 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.179
 is to make this duplicator to be 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.219
 digging half an hour to get 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.209
 a lot of sand to make crystals 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.159
 truth that can save us a lot 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.259
 time in survival mode and that 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.939
 tell them how the truth works 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.159
 which is very simple we are simply going to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.079
 activate and deactivate the lever 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.209
 many times but it is not necessary 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.819
 be giving the left trigger many 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.289
 times simply by leaving it pressed 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.119
 it will work as you are seeing it 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.429
 I'm doing like that by simply leaving 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.159
 the left trigger pressed during 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.479
 a while and we might even be seeing 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.280
 I make it something on the internet while 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.140
 we are using what we left the trigger 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
 left and then we collect all the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.160
 sand that has remained the truth that I 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 I really like this duplicator is very 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.580
 simple very simple to build occupy 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.460
 barely 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.800
 slowly and it will save us a lot 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.290
 time and I emphasize the time because the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.000
 truth that I hate to be all the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.980
 time with a shovel digging sand to 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.200
 get glass is something I hate 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.300
 personally so I hope guys that 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.620
 I liked this tutorial 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.110
 utility in your worlds of 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 survival keeps telling us about 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.400
 always guys just left like 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.830
 who supports his too for more videos 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.590
 and nothing I hope we see soon in 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.590
 new videos a little hello and see you later
