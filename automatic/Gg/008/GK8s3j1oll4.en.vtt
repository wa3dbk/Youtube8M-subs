them with all the AP classes whatever
the<00:00:49.170> first<00:00:49.379> choice<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.190> into<00:00:50.430> college

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.820 

what<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:55.100> really<00:00:55.700> like<00:00:56.360> is<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:56.900> prepares<00:00:57.560> them

for<00:00:57.860> college<00:00:58.310> in<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.880> way<00:00:59.090> that<00:00:59.480> I<00:00:59.510> think<00:01:00.440> is

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
for college in a way that I think is

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.100 
for college in a way that I think is
gonna<00:01:00.740> make<00:01:00.980> them<00:01:01.190> competitive<00:01:02.110> with

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
gonna make them competitive with

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.820 
gonna make them competitive with
students<00:01:03.830> from<00:01:04.160> not<00:01:04.850> just<00:01:05.420> other<00:01:06.290> parts<00:01:06.710> of

I think they expose the children to

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.480 
I think they expose the children to
diversity<00:03:39.160> because<00:03:40.160> they<00:03:40.280> come<00:03:40.460> from

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
diversity because they come from

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.270 
diversity because they come from
different<00:03:40.790> areas<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.690> different
