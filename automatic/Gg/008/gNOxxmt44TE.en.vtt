you know

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.880 
you know
they<00:02:13.540> need<00:02:13.780> more<00:02:13.990> time<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.770> think

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
they need more time so I think

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.580 
they need more time so I think

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.199 
opinion the only negative that I see on
this<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.170> what<00:02:24.069> kind<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.610> call<00:02:24.819> duty<00:02:25.000> how<00:02:25.150> are

for model or 43 and model 143 in my

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.190 
for model or 43 and model 143 in my
opinion<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.060> worst<00:02:37.390> call<00:02:37.600> duty<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.080> I've

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
opinion is the worst call duty that I've

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.710 
opinion is the worst call duty that I've
ever<00:02:38.380> played<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.430> our<00:02:39.520> multiplayer<00:02:40.120> I

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
ever played as for our multiplayer I

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.809 
ever played as for our multiplayer I
never<00:02:41.230> play<00:02:41.410> called<00:02:41.650> 33<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.069> lot<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.370> people<00:02:42.610> say

and model work for three and my opinions

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.729 
and model work for three and my opinions
are<00:02:50.650> worse<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:52.060> might<00:02:52.209> be<00:02:52.360> fun<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.600> watch<00:02:52.810> but

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
are worse it might be fun to watch but

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.040 
are worse it might be fun to watch but
it's<00:02:53.920> probably<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.489> most<00:02:54.640> frustrating<00:02:55.050> call

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.500 
duty to play a multiplayer on that's
just<00:02:59.140> my<00:02:59.320> opinion<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.739> course<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:01.390> know

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510

don't<00:03:39.370> know<00:03:39.489> what<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:40.150> a

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
don't know what that is it's a

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.890 
don't know what that is it's a
free-to-play<00:03:42.100> game<00:03:42.400> free<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.269> play<00:03:43.390> call<00:03:43.720> duty

free-to-play game free to play call duty
game<00:03:44.220> from<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.459> think<00:03:45.700> Japan<00:03:46.150> or<00:03:46.390> China<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.959> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
game from I think Japan or China and the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.190 
game from I think Japan or China and the
way<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.040> works<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.519> if<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:49.030> want<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:50.049> know<00:03:50.170> a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
way it works is if you want you know a

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.310 
way it works is if you want you know a
certain<00:03:50.500> gun<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:51.040> buy<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.340> it's

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
certain gun you buy it it's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.289 
certain gun you buy it it's
microtransaction<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.950> it's<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> mix

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
microtransaction and it's like a mix

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.710 
microtransaction and it's like a mix
between<00:03:55.530> called<00:03:56.530> 30<00:03:56.739> for<00:03:56.769> mana<00:03:57.610> 142<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.390> think

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
between called 30 for mana 142 I think

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.979 
between called 30 for mana 142 I think
black<00:03:59.620> ops<00:03:59.829> 1<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.310> model<00:04:00.549> or<00:04:00.640> 43<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.780> just

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
black ops 1 and model or 43 and it just

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.870 
black ops 1 and model or 43 and it just
looks<00:04:02.170> awesome<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:02.739> they<00:04:02.950> were<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.640> develop

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
looks awesome so they were to develop

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.180 
looks awesome so they were to develop
that<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.510> know<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.959> would<00:04:05.260> be<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:06.070> know

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
that a you know it would be you know

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.550 
that a you know it would be you know
completely<00:04:06.720> completely<00:04:07.720> awesome<00:04:08.019> but<00:04:08.530> I

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
completely completely awesome but I

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.110 
completely completely awesome but I
doubt<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.370> that's<00:04:09.489> what<00:04:09.790> they're<00:04:09.940> going<00:04:10.060> to

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
doubt that that's what they're going to

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.300 
doubt that that's what they're going to
do<00:04:10.329> but<00:04:11.049> regardless<00:04:11.200> like<00:04:11.769> i<00:04:11.829> said<00:04:12.070> i'm<00:04:12.190> going

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
do but regardless like i said i'm going

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.190 
do but regardless like i said i'm going
to<00:04:12.370> give<00:04:12.519> them<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.700> chance<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.209> hopefully<00:04:13.959> they

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
to give them a chance and hopefully they

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.009 
to give them a chance and hopefully they
don't<00:04:14.500> disappoint<00:04:14.769> like<00:04:15.519> they<00:04:16.299> did<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.539> me<00:04:16.870> at

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
don't disappoint like they did for me at

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.750 
don't disappoint like they did for me at
