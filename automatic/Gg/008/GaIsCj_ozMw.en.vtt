00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello with you t with t in and i'm tanya 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.500
 green we all know what a humidifier is 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.940
 air we all know what is 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.740
 air purifier 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.599
 but there is a device that combines 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.730
 these qualities such a device is called 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.650
 air wash and today I want you 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.859
 present two models in our test 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.589
 who are 300 model and stadler friends 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.779
 form is called robert let's in 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.210
 literally we will sort the timbre 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 I want to show the principle of washing 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.660
 air in general 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.970
 remove the motor unit in which 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.830
 there is a mote fan 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.990
 air pollutants drag on 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.870
 fan in the device gets here on 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.240
 these plastic porous discs are discs in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.300
 the turn goes through the water and the whole 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.990
 the dust is washed off into the water tank 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.230
 accordingly, this device is not 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.330
 no special replacement filters all 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.100
 disassemble parts wash washed 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.750
 either under water or cleaned 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.500
 special brush that is 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.140
 complete 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.659
 we get very low noise and 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.179
 low power consumption both 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.070
 enjoy this capacity is poured 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.869
 up to four and a half liters of water and 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.969
 accordingly we stop working 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.520
 unit with a fan and is selected on 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.640
 display required mode 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.890
 we can choose the fan speed 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.479
 average maximum and minimum 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.079
 Of course it depends on the volume of the room. 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.749
 first of all there is an automatic mode 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.770
 there is a night mode which reduces 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.990
 noise level and 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.509
 y exceeds the backlight also on the display 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.880
 It reflects the level of humidity in the room 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.770
 This model has an ionizer 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 periodically by pollution just 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.670
 cleaned and filters installed inside 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.250
 prefilter which 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.700
 periodically understands my forty-two 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.869
 weeks 1 month as it will and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
 additional disinfection module 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.750
 which changes once a year by 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.909
 of necessity 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 it only remains to add what works 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.130
 you very quietly consume only 7 watts 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.310
 electricity just on electricity 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 save and cost the city â€‹â€‹store 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.519
 about 13,000 rubles and now stadler 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.250
 form of the kind is air wash with absolutely 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.489
 identical working principle is different 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.349
 of course outwardly above all even 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.620
 aluminum parts are used in 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.480
 design of this model and very interesting 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.000
 control system it turns on with 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.010
 we use gestures to activate 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 menu and then as a sensor in 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.349
 We use and the water tank with him 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.700
 has a volume of 6 half liters that 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.849
 allows you to use it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.560
 long and large areas up to 80 meters 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.790
 according to the manufacturer will 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 such an effective device we remove this 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.069
 capacity immediately see that we have a filter 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.079
 interchangeable just this case there is it 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.370
 ion exchange filter two to three times 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.930
 the month is changing here we pour water 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.600
 close the filter and set to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.459
 the device will still show the filter and here it is 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.319
 silver filter which is also somewhere 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.670
 changes annually applied to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 disinfection 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.780
 and aroma filter over here on this 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.610
 we can periodically dig a plate 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.860
 some sort of aromatic substance for 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.780
 you see the pleasant smell of the rooms 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880
 drum 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.700
 the plates also rotates disassembled 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.739
 By the way, too, just this one 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.959
 this plate container is taken out 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.680
 unwind washed cleaned 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.680
 put in place 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.260
 water container we install 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:44.080
 and the device fixes see for yourself the map 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.530
 controlled device has a touch 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.790
 the control is activated by the usual button 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.700
 but it can be activated by 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.510
 gestures if he is in sleep mode 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.060
 on activate the menu using the movement 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.150
 arms upper ear adjusts degree 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.680
 moistening the middle key gives us 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.250
 ability to adjust speed 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.560
 fan and bottom key this 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.049
 automatic mode or automatic 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.820
 maintaining the desired humidity 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.050
 maximum either sleep mode when and 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.299
 displays 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.030
 muffled look and noise level also 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.970
 lowered on bird seams are not cheap 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.940
 about 20,000 rubles he also consumes 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.520
 slightly from 7 to 30 watts depending on 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.250
 regime and probably here in this case I 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.560
 would still choose the tone because 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.390
 cheaper and less replaceable 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.310
 filters need to buy it but from me 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.900
 small apartment area I would 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.960
 the device would be enough 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.420
 I test about you and choose before 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.230
 buy see the test and subscribe to 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.230
 our channel bye
