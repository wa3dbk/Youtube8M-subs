00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
however the committee has done I think a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160 
however the committee has done I think a
really<00:00:29.760> outstanding<00:00:29.910> job<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.019> could

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
really outstanding job and you could

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.430 
really outstanding job and you could
make<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> case<00:00:31.710> if<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.610> look<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.910> RPI's

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
make a case if you want to look at RPI's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
make a case if you want to look at RPI's
schedule<00:00:34.440> strengths<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.610> sometimes

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
schedule strengths but I think sometimes

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
schedule strengths but I think sometimes
you<00:00:36.239> got<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> take<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> eye<00:00:36.809> test<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.559> when

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you got to take the eye test and when

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
you got to take the eye test and when
you<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> eye<00:00:38.399> test<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.090> basketball

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you take the eye test and basketball

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
you take the eye test and basketball
judgments<00:00:40.500> utilize<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> Drexel

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
judgments utilize I think that Drexel

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
judgments utilize I think that Drexel
should<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.809> been<00:00:42.930> parted<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.350> feel<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
should have been parted to feel the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
should have been parted to feel the
question<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> who<00:00:45.300> should<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.660> been

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
question then is who should have been

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
question then is who should have been
not<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> field<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.550> real<00:00:47.700> tough

people<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.750> does<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
people so I would think does it be a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
people so I would think does it be a
little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
little bit but not really much to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
little bit but not really much to
complain<00:01:25.439> about<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.189> think<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
complain about because I think the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
complain about because I think the
committee<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.630> did<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.350> fair<00:01:28.710> job<00:01:29.009> an

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
committee really did a very fair job an

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.179 
committee really did a very fair job an
honest<00:01:29.970> job<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> did<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> job<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> think

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
honest job and did a job that I think

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.670 
honest job and did a job that I think
has<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:32.759> together<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.360> feel<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.470> really

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
has put together a feel that's really

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.980 
has put together a feel that's really
the<00:01:35.009> goliaths<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.299> we're<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:36.570> prevail

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the goliaths I think we're gonna prevail

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.499 
the goliaths I think we're gonna prevail
I<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.829> tough<00:01:38.189> group<00:01:38.579> tougher<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I think this tough group tougher than it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
I think this tough group tougher than it
was<00:01:39.630> spitting<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.020> pass<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> tough

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
was spitting a pass I think the tough

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.020 
was spitting a pass I think the tough
teams<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.090> top<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.079> tough<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.130> again

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
teams on top will be tough to be again

well I think what it's all said and done
I<00:02:57.489> think<00:02:57.939> the<00:02:58.239> suffocating<00:02:58.780> defense<00:02:59.109> of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
I think the suffocating defense of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.339 
I think the suffocating defense of
Kentucky<00:03:00.129> I<00:03:00.280> think<00:03:00.879> they<00:03:01.030> prevail<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.840> think

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
Kentucky I think they prevail I think

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.339 
Kentucky I think they prevail I think
that<00:03:02.469> John<00:03:02.680> Calipari<00:03:03.189> utilizes<00:03:04.000> as

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
that John Calipari utilizes as

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.780 
that John Calipari utilizes as
motivation<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.739> fact<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.159> they<00:03:06.370> got<00:03:06.519> beat

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
motivation the fact that they got beat

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.059 
motivation the fact that they got beat
today<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.719> tournament<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.409> think<00:03:08.919> he'll

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
today in the tournament I think he'll

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.490 
today in the tournament I think he'll
use<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.519> as<00:03:09.669> a<00:03:09.699> positive<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.689> that<00:03:11.139> he'll<00:03:11.319> get

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
use that as a positive in that he'll get

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.050 
use that as a positive in that he'll get
the<00:03:11.680> attention<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:12.310> his<00:03:12.459> players<00:03:12.760> to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
the attention of his players to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.539 
the attention of his players to
understand<00:03:13.870> you're<00:03:14.349> vulnerable<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.340> you

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
understand you're vulnerable that you

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.640 
understand you're vulnerable that you
better<00:03:15.790> play<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.299> urgency<00:03:16.689> and<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.409> better
