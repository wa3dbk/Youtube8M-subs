00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
previous home and these trees I think

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.740 
previous home and these trees I think
about<00:00:14.340> twenty-one<00:00:14.880> years<00:00:15.120> old<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.480> together

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
about twenty-one years old all together

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.880 
about twenty-one years old all together
