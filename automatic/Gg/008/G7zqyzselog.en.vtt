00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
way and you pan over there to that tree

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
way and you pan over there to that tree
we<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.640> now<00:00:17.640> pan<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.029> me<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.420> jack<00:00:18.690> we

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
we have to now pan on me here jack we

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.700 
we have to now pan on me here jack we
have<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.980> actually<00:00:20.699> push<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:22.230> back<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
have to actually push it out go back and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.590 
have to actually push it out go back and
and<00:00:23.130> slide<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.640> between<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.000> tree<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.480> then

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and slide in between the tree and then

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.380 
and slide in between the tree and then
bring<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.840> around<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.820> it's<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.269> to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.570 

wasn't<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:16.910> bad<00:03:16.940> okay<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.980> ran<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.160> siding

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
wasn't so bad okay so I ran the siding

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.750 
wasn't so bad okay so I ran the siding
wild<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.560> what<00:03:21.740> I'll<00:03:21.890> do<00:03:22.070> is<00:03:22.280> will<00:03:22.460> snap

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
wild here and what I'll do is will snap

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.910 
wild here and what I'll do is will snap
with<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.910> snap<00:03:23.210> a<00:03:23.240> line<00:03:23.510> we<00:03:24.170> got<00:03:24.290> seven<00:03:24.740> feet

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
with the snap a line we got seven feet

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.810 
with the snap a line we got seven feet
here<00:03:25.390> we've<00:03:26.390> got<00:03:26.630> six<00:03:27.380> feet<00:03:27.560> there<00:03:27.830> mm-hmm<00:03:28.670> and

here we've got six feet there mm-hmm and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.640 
here we've got six feet there mm-hmm and
so<00:03:29.330> we'll<00:03:29.450> just<00:03:29.480> snap<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> line<00:03:30.020> there<00:03:30.320> I'll

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
so we'll just snap a line there I'll

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.890 
so we'll just snap a line there I'll
take<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:31.010> kilt<00:03:31.190> skill<00:03:31.520> saw<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:32.510> I'll<00:03:32.630> cut

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
take the kilt skill saw that I'll cut

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.110 
take the kilt skill saw that I'll cut
that<00:03:33.080> is<00:03:33.830> this<00:03:34.010> easier<00:03:34.430> for<00:03:34.610> me<00:03:34.730> than<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.910> have

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
that is this easier for me than to have

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.770 
that is this easier for me than to have
to<00:03:35.240> try<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.450> figure<00:03:35.660> out<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.990> math<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.480> yeah<00:03:38.480> so

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
to try to figure out the math so yeah so

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.570 
to try to figure out the math so yeah so
we're<00:03:38.960> we<00:03:39.530> don't<00:03:39.710> have<00:03:39.800> much<00:03:39.950> left<00:03:40.160> here<00:03:40.310> where

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:12.430 
too bad I'm only half here so we got to
pull<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.150> bottom<00:04:02.510> in<00:04:10.540> okay<00:04:11.540> that's<00:04:11.750> idea<00:04:12.200> so

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
pull the bottom in okay that's idea so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.530 
pull the bottom in okay that's idea so
let's<00:04:12.620> put<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.920> screw<00:04:13.490> in<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:13.880> just<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.300> hold

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
let's put a screw in this just to hold

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.080 
let's put a screw in this just to hold
it<00:04:14.720> then<00:04:14.959> we'll<00:04:15.080> bring<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.380> other<00:04:15.500> side<00:04:15.800> here

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
it then we'll bring the other side here

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.520 
it then we'll bring the other side here
now<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.150> others<00:04:17.540> are<00:04:17.780> kind<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.049> squished<00:04:18.320> we

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
now the others are kind of squished we

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.789 
now the others are kind of squished we
don't<00:04:18.680> have<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.950> really<00:04:19.220> worry<00:04:19.580> much<00:04:19.880> do<00:04:20.150> we

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
don't have to really worry much do we

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.760 
don't have to really worry much do we
well<00:04:22.420> once<00:04:23.420> we<00:04:23.630> get<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.020> corners<00:04:24.410> tied<00:04:24.620> in

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
well once we get the corners tied in

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.260 
well once we get the corners tied in
they'll<00:04:24.920> have<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.100> nice<00:04:25.280> hard<00:04:25.550> corner<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.150> we'll

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
they'll have a nice hard corner so we'll

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.580 
they'll have a nice hard corner so we'll
be<00:04:26.390> in<00:04:26.480> better<00:04:26.630> shape<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:27.080> I'll<00:04:27.290> just<00:04:27.470> walk

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
be in better shape so I'll just walk

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.470 
be in better shape so I'll just walk
places<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.160> me<00:04:28.280> are<00:04:28.460> we<00:04:28.580> gonna<00:04:28.730> screw

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
places with me are we gonna screw

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.380 
places with me are we gonna screw
everything<00:04:29.840> together<00:04:30.310> here<00:04:31.310> mm-hmm<00:04:32.090> this

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
everything together here mm-hmm this

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.030 
everything together here mm-hmm this
needs<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.750> be<00:04:32.810> flush<00:04:33.580> now<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.640> see<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:36.590> reason

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
needs to be flush now you see the reason

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.330 
needs to be flush now you see the reason
why<00:04:37.280> we<00:04:37.870> we<00:04:38.870> put<00:04:39.110> those<00:04:39.260> spacers<00:04:39.919> in<00:04:40.160> those

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
why we we put those spacers in those

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.810 
why we we put those spacers in those
corners<00:04:40.700> because<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:42.310> being<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.520> probably

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
corners because this being is probably

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.050 
corners because this being is probably
good

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
good

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.540 
good
exposed<00:04:44.540> us<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.050> way<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.290> is<00:04:45.350> for<00:04:45.590> Jack<00:04:45.800> for

exposed us be the way it is for Jack for

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.310 
exposed us be the way it is for Jack for
a<00:04:46.580> while<00:04:46.760> unless<00:04:46.940> he<00:04:47.060> wants<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.360> finish<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:48.070> is

a while unless he wants to finish it is
this<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.440> three<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.770> half<00:04:51.860> inches<00:04:52.160> these

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
this is three and a half inches these

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.460 
this is three and a half inches these
are<00:04:53.060> three<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.360> half<00:04:53.540> inches<00:04:53.900> these<00:04:54.139> two<00:04:54.320> by

are three and a half inches these two by

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.650 
are three and a half inches these two by
fours<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.010> with<00:04:55.639> that<00:04:55.790> spacer<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.360> makes<00:04:56.540> it
