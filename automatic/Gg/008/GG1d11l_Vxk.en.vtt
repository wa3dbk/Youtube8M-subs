maroon<00:00:03.540> 5<00:00:03.810> it's<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:05.000> super<00:00:06.000> easy<00:00:06.150> song<00:00:06.480> there's

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
maroon 5 it's a super easy song there's

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
not a good core chart for it yet so i

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.390 
not a good core chart for it yet so i
think<00:00:09.210> i<00:00:09.300> might<00:00:09.590> just<00:00:10.590> make<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.099> then<00:00:11.219> put

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
think i might just make one and then put

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
up you got to release the cordage time

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:26.400 
up you got to release the cordage time
just<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.590> we<00:02:15.709> were<00:02:15.800> doing<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:21.880> that's<00:02:22.880> minor

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.870 

so<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:27.620> hard<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.190> can<00:02:28.310> be<00:02:28.430> hard<00:02:28.640> if<00:02:28.760> your

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
so that's hard it can be hard if your

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.570 
so that's hard it can be hard if your
total<00:02:29.120> beginner<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.690> leave<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> comment

give myself more strength special

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.740 
give myself more strength special
acoustic<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:43.280> those<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.000> f<00:03:44.180> minor<00:03:45.519> pull<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:47.450> five

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
bass notes you could go like this so

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.450 
bass notes you could go like this so
half<00:04:06.900> eight<00:04:07.530> eight<00:04:08.040> eight<00:04:08.370> eight<00:04:09.000> six<00:04:09.750> six<00:04:10.500> six

six and getting that down like that and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.340 
six and getting that down like that and
a<00:04:14.760> pulse<00:04:15.030> will<00:04:15.540> actually<00:04:15.810> help<00:04:15.960> you<00:04:16.170> later

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350

10<00:05:13.559> minor<00:05:19.499> the<00:05:20.499> reason<00:05:20.800> why<00:05:20.919> we<00:05:21.039> needed<00:05:21.189> the

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:21.249 
10 minor the reason why we needed the

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.299 
10 minor the reason why we needed the
capo<00:05:21.729> is<00:05:22.029> to<00:05:22.240> match<00:05:22.449> the<00:05:22.779> song<00:05:23.069> so<00:05:24.069> you<00:05:24.159> could

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:24.309 
capo is to match the song so you could

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:26.549 
capo is to match the song so you could
actually<00:05:24.490> do<00:05:24.819> this<00:05:24.969> with<00:05:25.179> no<00:05:25.360> capo<00:05:25.779> like<00:05:26.199> you

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:26.559 
actually do this with no capo like you

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:32.590 
actually do this with no capo like you
just<00:05:26.800> go

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.330 

the<00:05:33.080> problem<00:05:33.440> with<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.650> if<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:33.920> try<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.130> go
