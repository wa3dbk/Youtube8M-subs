00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.650
 common sense 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:14.269
 Who are you from this time only students do not know 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:20.070
 I would like to talk about common sense of deviation value 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:25.500
 It's there is a common sense the deviation value that has not been informed rather than just guts Board do not know 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.150
 I think that the deviation value is coming out quickly in this everyday conversation, but how are all students 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 I think maybe there are 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.309
 I think that often appear able to say even deviation value in the relationship that the teacher or between teachers and students 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.060
 I think it will come out, but what do you know when the deviation value is said ? 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.690
 No Uu 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:48.160
 I think it would be like that, so this is the first time 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.690
 Seen your story you and from there that I deviation value in the first place, or rather what the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.020
 I would like to talk in depth about how I should study 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.050
 In the first place what is the deviation value 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 Well , I can't help talking about such a definition that you want statistically 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.100
 And here's a relative evaluation if you're ex-crime 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:12.500
 Deviation value theme is relative evaluation What is relative evaluation 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.610
 And say what it For example, if there is I rainy season man Well scattered my hemp 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.380
 Mostly university 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.180
 It was 70 at the time of the new time, but this is in agreement with 100 etc. Deviation value q 10 etc. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.190
 I have a 100 and the crab Purogo 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:31.070
 Speaking of how to do it is to shake all other students to kindergarten children 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.600
 On the other hand, there is a way to lower the deviation to about 30 even if I solve the problem as hard as possible. 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.299
 What other students should say 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.869
 Were pooled and my primary to Fu Tteyuu be just to everyone bureaucracy Toka super genius scholar to about 30 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.110
 Become 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.840
 In short, how much superior you are compared to other students 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.250
 It's given to say deviation value of I mean there are 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.590
 It does not matter that you are able to understand how much Toka how much it has been found 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.060
 Contact Kaa 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.929
 It is the deviation value to say how long people are ashamed or stupid 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:08.170
 So let's raise the Xuan Sachi Let's study for the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:09.220
 In fact Let me give you do we're field Kou funny but let's study than others to the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.610
 I'm right 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.510
 I guess this is probably not what I think it's a big deal to know the deviation 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.180
 I think that not learned maybe 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.860
 This is a very important way of thinking. Well, here you want to raise the deviation value 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.940
 What does not go and does not and if it is assumed that I Datte do not raise the deviation value absolute 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:35.530
 So it's important that you get smarter than other people , but if you think you 're going to get mud sand super 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.090
 If you can also practice 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:48.250
 It's a good thing If you want to be someone you can do more than others 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:50.890
 The way is simple First to study longer than others and one more to others 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.910
 That all teachers in a darker missed than 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.300
 This second grade is considered 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.470
 Slowly English of end No. test apple 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.470
 Whether I of this English word after this much obtained of here Oh 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.810
 Correct answer announcement 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.400
 I understand that I have understood 0 0 I see I see I see I see I see I see 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.680
 I think it has been found but it is understood 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.420
 This is another person who learns to play , I think I will study only one hour 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:33.269
 But if you study for 2 hours and 3 hours, you will be able to have a flower . 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.569
 Or you can study for 2 hours in the middle of the guy who is doing for 2 hours 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.390
 Are 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:41.830
 If you say either way you can get points, you can still get concentrated effect points 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:46.209
 You are to study a long time or in the fact that I 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:50.830
 I'm I mean Tsu to study in love missed two things are required 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:56.080
 There are important things here and I am particularly educated. I want to go to a lighthouse 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.380
 That is say to study a longer period of time is impossible on the jeep of Tteyuu such a person 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.200
 How because the University of Tokyo 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:07.340
 If 10 hours a day What guy to encounter and to the I I'm studying in cold blood Toka 12 hours 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:12.620
 The most important thing is to study with more density 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:17.400
 Study how to get the most effect in a short amount of time 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:21.090
 This will be important, of course it will open up to study for a long time 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 I'm not saying that, of course I think it's a great thing to study for a long time 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.270
 It's great, but it's here 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.479
 It is important to say that doing this with a lot of density is more important 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.100
 This time only students are not informed about yes 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.060
 With common sense of the deviation value 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:41.940
 And say something to renegade the first place that I was allowed to talk 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:47.490
 You can or can not be a relative evaluation of a number of other people but I was This is what Tteyuu's important 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.480
 If that is the case, it would be better if you could do more than others if you wanted to raise the deviation value 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.090
 It is a thing 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.980
 I will study for two long hours as a profane argument for that 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.990
 It means that you can either increase the amount of 3 movies or the number of ship reports . 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.440
 Click here for this video 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.550
 It was to proceed to study at a high density 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:11.110
 Video Thank you for your viewing is more than at this time in that 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.080
 In the next video, what should I do specifically to study at this dense density? 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.409
 Ya about the fact that 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.159
 I would like to find 8 comments on this video

 Anything can be good or bad, so please comment in the comments below 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.139
 I'm happy 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.009
 I would like to subscribe to the industrialization and channels, and also follow up on Twitter willingly

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.740
 We will keep on delivering more and more useful information for such exams in the future . 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.100
 I'm glad if you

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.410
 Let's come 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.130
 Thank you for watching this video 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:46.710
 Regards related videos if you like 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:52.370
 Good mail also taught me a booklet to raise the grades from the url of the gifts in the video summary column 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.370
 Please tell me your address and we will meet again next time
