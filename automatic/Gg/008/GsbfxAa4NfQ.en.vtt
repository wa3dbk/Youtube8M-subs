assistance and I said I would help and
when<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> got<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.690> thought<00:00:45.899> well<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
when I got it I thought well this is

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
when I got it I thought well this is
easy<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.829> mean<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> patterns<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
easy I mean the patterns here I just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.740 
easy I mean the patterns here I just
trace<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.690> no<00:00:49.680> big<00:00:49.890> deal<00:00:50.160> well<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.329> didn't

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
trace it out no big deal well I didn't

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
trace it out no big deal well I didn't
think<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.110> through<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.590> well

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
think it through very well

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160 
think it through very well
and<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> show<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> why<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.449> never

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and I'm going to show you why you never

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.010 
and I'm going to show you why you never
want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:58.100> doesn't<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.280> because

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
want to do this it doesn't work because

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.770 
want to do this it doesn't work because
although<00:01:01.020> MD<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.949> an<00:01:02.129> awful<00:01:02.520> lot<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.820> sewing

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
although MD is an awful lot like sewing

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.109 
although MD is an awful lot like sewing
in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> real<00:01:04.260> world<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.610> huge

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
in the real world there are some huge

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
in the real world there are some huge
differences<00:01:06.510> when<00:01:07.229> you're<00:01:07.380> using<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.860> real

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
differences when you're using a real

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
differences when you're using a real
world<00:01:08.430> pattern<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.180> seam<00:01:09.510> allowances<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
world pattern with seam allowances on it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.520 
world pattern with seam allowances on it
now<00:01:11.280> typically<00:01:11.850> seam<00:01:12.390> allowances<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.229> about

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
now typically seam allowances are about

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.910 
now typically seam allowances are about
5/8<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> an<00:01:14.430> inch<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.299> every<00:01:16.140> piece<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
5/8 of an inch so every piece that you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
5/8 of an inch so every piece that you
see<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.580> sewn<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> something<00:01:18.390> else

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
see here that's sewn to something else

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.499 
see here that's sewn to something else
the<00:01:18.869> top<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> sleeve<00:01:20.090> shoulders<00:01:21.090> side

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the top of the sleeve shoulders side

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
the top of the sleeve shoulders side
seam<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> whole<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:24.080> oversized<00:01:25.080> by<00:01:25.380> 5/8

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
seam the whole bit is oversized by 5/8

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.580 
seam the whole bit is oversized by 5/8
of<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.189> inch<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:27.090> pockets<00:01:27.659> are<00:01:27.979> oversized<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
of an inch the pockets are oversized and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
of an inch the pockets are oversized and
this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> big<00:01:32.070> problem<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.640> by<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this is a big problem because by the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
this is a big problem because by the
time<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.869> trace<00:01:34.320> everything<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> go

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
time you trace everything out if you go

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.450 
time you trace everything out if you go
by<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.579> original<00:01:35.939> outlines<00:01:36.860> you've<00:01:37.860> lost<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
by the original outlines you've lost the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
by the original outlines you've lost the
design<00:01:38.909> every<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.600> proportion<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
design every the proportion is going to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
design every the proportion is going to
be<00:01:40.710> wrong<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> pockets<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:42.000> huge<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
be wrong the pockets would be huge and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.469 
be wrong the pockets would be huge and
out<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.110> place<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:44.579> give<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.329> good

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
out of place to give you a really good

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
out of place to give you a really good
example<00:01:45.829> when<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.009> sewing<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
example when you're sewing this in the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
example when you're sewing this in the
real<00:01:48.180> world<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.689> cut<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> pattern<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
real world you cut the pattern out to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
real world you cut the pattern out to
this<00:01:50.729> line<00:01:51.000> over<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.200> fold<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
this line over here then you fold it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
this line over here then you fold it
once<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> fold<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.790> again<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
once then you fold it again and then you

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
once then you fold it again and then you
top<00:01:55.530> stitch<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.860> down<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> middle<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> can

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
top stitch it down the middle so you can

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.050 
top stitch it down the middle so you can
see<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.079> couldn't<00:01:58.799> even<00:01:59.040> include<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.850> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
see I couldn't even include all that in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.950 
see I couldn't even include all that in
the<00:02:00.210> MD<00:02:00.570> pattern<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.450> that's<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> more

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the MD pattern and that's the more

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.520 
the MD pattern and that's the more
obvious<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:05.070> many<00:02:05.490> many<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.969> places

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
obvious there are many many other places

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
obvious there are many many other places
where<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> case<00:02:08.099> these<00:02:08.940> pockets<00:02:09.539> for

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
where this is the case these pockets for

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.949 
where this is the case these pockets for
example<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:11.069> I'll<00:02:11.879> move<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.780> out

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
example you can see I'll move this out

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.180 
example you can see I'll move this out
of<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
of the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.310 
of the
whay<00:02:13.280> here's<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.880> original<00:02:14.150> Pocket<00:02:14.960> draft

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
whay here's the original Pocket draft

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.310 
whay here's the original Pocket draft
and<00:02:15.770> you'd<00:02:16.070> think<00:02:16.310> well<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:17.320> copy

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
and you'd think well I can just copy

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.620 
and you'd think well I can just copy
that<00:02:18.650> out<00:02:18.680> well<00:02:19.520> what<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.760> ended<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.180> doing<00:02:20.420> was

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
that out well what I ended up doing was

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.810 
that out well what I ended up doing was
using<00:02:21.140> these<00:02:21.470> placement<00:02:22.100> points<00:02:22.490> on<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
using these placement points on the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.760 
using these placement points on the
pattern<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.510> an<00:02:23.630> idea<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.320> finished

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
pattern to get an idea what the finished

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
pattern to get an idea what the finished
width<00:02:25.070> was<00:02:25.340> supposed<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.910> be<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.330> there's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
width was supposed to be and there's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.670 
width was supposed to be and there's
enormous<00:02:27.410> difference<00:02:28.220> between<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.880> two<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:30.230> I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
enormous difference between the two so I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000 
enormous difference between the two so I
did<00:02:31.610> some<00:02:32.060> adjustments<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.290> pockets<00:02:33.800> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
did some adjustments like the pockets I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.240 
did some adjustments like the pockets I
fixed<00:02:34.550> obviously<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> front<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> rest

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
fixed obviously the front for the rest

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.980 
fixed obviously the front for the rest
of<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.580> went<00:02:37.760> ahead<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.180> went<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
of it I went ahead and just went to the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.700 
of it I went ahead and just went to the
outline<00:02:39.470> because<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.370> was<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.540> futile<00:02:42.170> attempt

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
outline because it was a futile attempt

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.130 
outline because it was a futile attempt
at<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:42.890> point<00:02:43.430> but<00:02:44.180> let<00:02:44.420> me<00:02:44.540> show<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.840> what

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
at that point but let me show you what

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.110 
at that point but let me show you what
it<00:02:45.230> looks<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.800> MD<00:02:46.190> avatar<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.000> this

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
it looks like on the MD avatar and this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.360 
it looks like on the MD avatar and this
is<00:02:47.240> another<00:02:47.540> problem<00:02:47.840> with<00:02:48.740> using<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.190> sewing

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
is another problem with using a sewing

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.880 
is another problem with using a sewing
pattern<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.240> is<00:02:50.420> completely<00:02:51.140> wrong<00:02:51.530> for

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
pattern is this is completely wrong for

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.570 
pattern is this is completely wrong for
her<00:02:52.250> she's<00:02:52.970> quite<00:02:53.540> tall<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.160> these<00:02:55.160> sleeves

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
her she's quite tall and these sleeves

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.940 
her she's quite tall and these sleeves
are<00:02:55.760> not<00:02:55.940> nearly<00:02:56.270> long<00:02:56.600> enough<00:02:56.630> yet<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.650> body

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
are not nearly long enough yet the body

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.070 
are not nearly long enough yet the body
is<00:02:58.310> way<00:02:58.910> oversized<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.920> sleeves<00:03:01.400> are<00:03:01.760> too<00:03:02.510> big

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
is way oversized the sleeves are too big

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080 
is way oversized the sleeves are too big
you<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:03.860> all<00:03:04.130> this<00:03:04.280> gathering<00:03:04.520> going

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
you can see all this gathering going

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.120 
you can see all this gathering going
into<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> armhole<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.230> lot<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.010> is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
into the armhole a lot of that is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.810 
into the armhole a lot of that is
because<00:03:07.340> again<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.690> seam<00:03:08.900> allowance<00:03:09.350> is

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
because again the seam allowance is

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.570 
because again the seam allowance is
being<00:03:10.820> used<00:03:11.420> when<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.900> shouldn't<00:03:12.260> be<00:03:12.440> but<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
being used when it shouldn't be but the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.400 
being used when it shouldn't be but the
pockets<00:03:13.790> are<00:03:14.090> placed<00:03:14.240> appropriately<00:03:15.170> where

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
pockets are placed appropriately where

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.949 
pockets are placed appropriately where
they<00:03:15.560> should<00:03:15.800> be<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.340> then<00:03:17.060> back<00:03:17.420> here

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
they should be and then back here

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.860 
they should be and then back here
there's<00:03:18.800> supposed<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.730> be<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:19.910> casing<00:03:20.480> with

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
there's supposed to be a casing with

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.710 
there's supposed to be a casing with
some<00:03:21.260> elastic<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.250> or<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.760> drawstring<00:03:23.420> you

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
some elastic in it or a drawstring you

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.860 
some elastic in it or a drawstring you
can't<00:03:24.020> do<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.830> MD<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:26.060> that's<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.540> total

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
can't do that in MD so that's a total

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.960 
can't do that in MD so that's a total
fake<00:03:27.140> out<00:03:27.350> with<00:03:27.590> two<00:03:27.950> internal<00:03:28.400> lines<00:03:28.730> with

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
fake out with two internal lines with

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.800 
fake out with two internal lines with
elastic<00:03:29.540> properties<00:03:30.020> on<00:03:30.230> them<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.810> there's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
elastic properties on them so there's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.270 
elastic properties on them so there's
the<00:03:33.500> lab<00:03:33.739> coat<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:36.380> here<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.100> little

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
the lab coat so here we have the little

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.360 
the lab coat so here we have the little
scrubs<00:03:37.910> outfit<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.959> can<00:03:39.140> see<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.680> way

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
scrubs outfit and you can see it's way

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
scrubs outfit and you can see it's way
out<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.790> proportion

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
out of proportion

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.479 
out of proportion
when<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.230> brought<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.709> patterns<00:03:43.070> in<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.430> just

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
when I brought the patterns in I just

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.600 
when I brought the patterns in I just
guessed<00:03:44.090> how<00:03:44.330> big<00:03:44.570> they<00:03:44.750> needed<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.110> be<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.440> I

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
guessed how big they needed to be and I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.520 
guessed how big they needed to be and I
was<00:03:46.610> obviously<00:03:47.120> under<00:03:47.360> sized<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.230> little

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
was obviously under sized on the little

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.229 
was obviously under sized on the little
top<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.769> pants<00:03:49.400> actually<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.390> waist<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:51.019> huge

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
top and pants actually the waist is huge

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.290 
top and pants actually the waist is huge
but<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.570> length<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:54.050> way<00:03:54.350> off<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.880> gives

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
but the length is way off so that gives

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.600 
but the length is way off so that gives
you<00:03:56.480> some<00:03:56.510> idea<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.830> how<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.280> can<00:03:58.519> be

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
you some idea of how this can be

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.990 
you some idea of how this can be
difficult<00:03:59.080> now<00:04:00.080> on<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:00.739> particular<00:04:01.400> one<00:04:01.640> I

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
difficult now on this particular one I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.120 
difficult now on this particular one I
had<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.840> same<00:04:03.200> issue<00:04:03.470> with<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.540> pockets<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.959> I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
had the same issue with the pockets so I

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.370 
had the same issue with the pockets so I
resized<00:04:07.130> all<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.550> those<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.090> on<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.989> original

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
resized all of those and on the original

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.229 
resized all of those and on the original
pattern<00:04:09.560> you're<00:04:09.830> supposed<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.310> fold<00:04:10.730> over<00:04:10.940> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
pattern you're supposed to fold over the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.500 
pattern you're supposed to fold over the
top<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.840> sew<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.370> make<00:04:13.550> a<00:04:13.580> casing<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.390> then

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
top and sew it to make a casing and then

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.409 
top and sew it to make a casing and then
put<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.230> elastic<00:04:15.650> in<00:04:16.070> there<00:04:16.250> again<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.239> is

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
put the elastic in there again this is

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.750 
put the elastic in there again this is
not<00:04:17.600> something<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.109> want<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.320> do<00:04:18.470> an<00:04:18.590> MD<00:04:18.950> so

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
not something you want to do an MD so

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.510 
not something you want to do an MD so
all<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.269> them<00:04:20.480> are<00:04:20.570> cropped<00:04:21.350> off<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.890> top<00:04:22.100> and

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
all of them are cropped off the top and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.820 
all of them are cropped off the top and
then<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.880> created<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.539> separate<00:04:24.229> waistband

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
then I created this separate waistband

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.990 
then I created this separate waistband
piece<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:26.060> put<00:04:26.240> on

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
piece to put on

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.100 
piece to put on
applied<00:04:27.300> elastic<00:04:28.140> property<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:30.110> the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
applied elastic property to that the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.110 
applied elastic property to that the
pockets<00:04:31.800> were<00:04:32.070> interesting<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:35.400> did<00:04:35.850> this

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
pockets were interesting we did this

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.530 
pockets were interesting we did this
technique<00:04:36.720> on<00:04:37.190> my<00:04:38.190> pants<00:04:38.700> video<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.090> showed<00:04:39.510> you

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
technique on my pants video I showed you

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.200 
technique on my pants video I showed you
how<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.780> make<00:04:39.900> us<00:04:40.260> like<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.650> side<00:04:41.370> pocket<00:04:41.760> and

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
how to make us like a side pocket and

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.000 
how to make us like a side pocket and
these<00:04:42.780> are<00:04:42.930> pretty<00:04:43.050> much<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.350> same<00:04:43.530> thing

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
these are pretty much the same thing

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.240 
these are pretty much the same thing
except<00:04:44.460> for<00:04:44.670> in<00:04:44.790> this<00:04:44.970> case<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:46.320> they're<00:04:47.040> not

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
except for in this case that they're not

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.430 
except for in this case that they're not
two<00:04:47.520> separate<00:04:47.940> pieces<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.570> was<00:04:48.690> one<00:04:48.960> piece<00:04:49.200> and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
two separate pieces it was one piece and

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.220 
two separate pieces it was one piece and
it<00:04:49.500> was<00:04:49.620> folded<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.190> half<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:51.450> did<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.960> it

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
it was folded in half and I did it it

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.710 
it was folded in half and I did it it
took<00:04:52.290> quite<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.220> long<00:04:53.460> time<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:54.060> do<00:04:54.300> it<00:04:54.480> but<00:04:55.490> let

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
took quite a long time to do it but let

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.400 
took quite a long time to do it but let
me<00:04:57.860> turn<00:04:58.860> down<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.550> opacity<00:05:00.060> here<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.080> can

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
me turn down the opacity here so you can

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.850 
me turn down the opacity here so you can
see<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:06.270> those<00:05:06.570> pockets<00:05:07.110> are<00:05:07.320> sitting<00:05:07.710> in

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
see that those pockets are sitting in

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.900 
see that those pockets are sitting in
there<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.190> they're<00:05:08.340> folded<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:10.710> took<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.610> while

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
there and they're folded it took a while

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.870 
there and they're folded it took a while
to<00:05:11.940> this<00:05:12.120> one<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.390> can<00:05:12.750> see<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.960> corner<00:05:13.440> is

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
to this one you can see the corner is

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.730 
to this one you can see the corner is
flopped<00:05:14.880> back<00:05:15.210> so<00:05:15.630> that's<00:05:15.870> not<00:05:16.080> even<00:05:16.140> straight

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
flopped back so that's not even straight

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.060 
flopped back so that's not even straight
in<00:05:17.010> there<00:05:17.630> this<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.870> one<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:19.500> first<00:05:19.710> one

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
in there this is the one the first one

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.070 
in there this is the one the first one
that<00:05:20.280> I<00:05:20.340> did<00:05:20.640> was<00:05:20.880> this<00:05:21.060> set<00:05:21.390> before<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.870> lab

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
that I did was this set before the lab

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.770 
that I did was this set before the lab
coat<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:22.800> tried<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:24.150> follow<00:05:24.360> the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
coat and I tried to follow the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.430 
coat and I tried to follow the
instructions<00:05:25.770> as<00:05:26.130> if<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.060> was<00:05:27.240> sewing<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.140> I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
instructions as if I was sewing it and I

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.440 
instructions as if I was sewing it and I
ended<00:05:28.800> up<00:05:28.919> going<00:05:29.100> back<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.580> throwing<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:30.060> lot

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
ended up going back and throwing a lot

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.500 
ended up going back and throwing a lot
of<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.690> away<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:31.260> was<00:05:31.410> just<00:05:31.710> too<00:05:32.490> complex<00:05:33.090> with

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
of it away it was just too complex with

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.980 
of it away it was just too complex with
pieces<00:05:34.020> folded<00:05:34.500> in<00:05:34.650> half<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.160> then<00:05:35.310> sewn<00:05:35.640> on

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
pieces folded in half and then sewn on

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.570 
pieces folded in half and then sewn on
again<00:05:36.990> we<00:05:37.260> have<00:05:37.470> problems<00:05:38.040> with<00:05:38.250> seam

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
again we have problems with seam

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.960 
again we have problems with seam
allowances<00:05:39.620> because<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.890> didn't<00:05:41.310> take<00:05:41.520> all<00:05:41.760> of

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
allowances because I didn't take all of

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.969 
allowances because I didn't take all of
these<00:05:42.150> in<00:05:42.450> everything<00:05:43.140> should<00:05:43.350> be<00:05:43.470> taken<00:05:43.830> in

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
these in everything should be taken in

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.480 
these in everything should be taken in
about<00:05:44.100> 5/8<00:05:44.700> of<00:05:44.850> an<00:05:45.030> inch<00:05:45.320> there's<00:05:46.320> also<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.890> back

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
about 5/8 of an inch there's also a back

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.540 
about 5/8 of an inch there's also a back
collar<00:05:48.380> interfacing<00:05:49.380> here<00:05:49.710> that<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.190> didn't

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
collar interfacing here that I didn't

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.090 
collar interfacing here that I didn't
even<00:05:50.610> put<00:05:51.330> on<00:05:51.510> actually<00:05:52.169> I<00:05:52.470> did<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:52.979> then<00:05:53.070> I

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
even put on actually I did and then I

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.270 
even put on actually I did and then I
threw<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.430> away<00:05:53.490> what<00:05:53.880> it<00:05:54.150> looks<00:05:54.419> so<00:05:54.600> bad<00:05:55.280> so

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
threw it away what it looks so bad so

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.340 
threw it away what it looks so bad so
this<00:05:56.669> wasn't<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:57.120> complete<00:05:57.510> waste<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.870> time<00:05:57.930> for

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
this wasn't a complete waste of time for

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.520 
this wasn't a complete waste of time for
me<00:05:58.470> because<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:59.040> was<00:05:59.430> wrong<00:05:59.880> I<00:06:00.360> thought<00:06:01.260> that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
me because I was wrong I thought that

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.860 
me because I was wrong I thought that
you<00:06:01.800> could<00:06:01.979> take<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.220> sewing<00:06:02.640> pattern<00:06:02.970> and<00:06:03.210> whip

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
you could take a sewing pattern and whip

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.650 
you could take a sewing pattern and whip
it<00:06:04.020> up<00:06:04.110> an<00:06:04.320> MD<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.800> no<00:06:05.070> problem<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.790> fact

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
it up an MD and no problem but the fact

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.550 
it up an MD and no problem but the fact
is<00:06:06.960> it's<00:06:07.350> not<00:06:07.919> easy<00:06:08.310> I<00:06:08.790> know<00:06:09.360> how<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:09.900> sew<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:10.470> I

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
is it's not easy I know how to sew and I

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.270 
is it's not easy I know how to sew and I
know<00:06:10.620> MD<00:06:11.190> and<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.610> was<00:06:11.820> struggling<00:06:12.180> so<00:06:12.630> if<00:06:13.280> you

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
know MD and I was struggling so if you

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.730 
know MD and I was struggling so if you
think<00:06:14.550> that<00:06:14.700> you<00:06:15.390> want<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.810> get<00:06:15.960> a<00:06:15.990> hold<00:06:16.380> of<00:06:16.620> a

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
think that you want to get a hold of a

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.920
