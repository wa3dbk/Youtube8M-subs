00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
anything big i think it was like a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.060 
anything big i think it was like a
couple<00:02:32.250> days<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.030> still<00:02:33.090> wear<00:02:34.080> earrings<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
couple days but still wear earrings the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.510 
couple days but still wear earrings the
whole<00:02:35.310> time<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.600> then<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:37.680> after<00:02:37.710> i<00:02:38.400> took

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
whole time and then right after i took

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970 
whole time and then right after i took
them<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.540> left<00:02:39.900> them<00:02:40.320> out<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> few
