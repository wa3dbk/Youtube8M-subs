00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
definitely matching tonight one of the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.410 
definitely matching tonight one of the
matches<00:01:08.430> were<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.730> car<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.120> shield

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
matches were on this car the shield

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.610 
matches were on this car the shield
versus<00:01:11.750> with<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.870> shield<00:01:13.110> fight<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.470> it

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
versus with the shield fight I think it

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.770 
versus with the shield fight I think it
was<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.800> Orton<00:01:14.280> Big<00:01:14.610> Show<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.180> Sheamus<00:01:15.630> or

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
was like Orton Big Show and Sheamus or

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.430 
was like Orton Big Show and Sheamus or
something<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.050> that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
something like that

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.520 
something like that
six-man<00:01:16.860> tag<00:01:17.130> match<00:01:18.170> what<00:01:19.170> else<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.620> me

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
six-man tag match what else was on me

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.450 
six-man tag match what else was on me
