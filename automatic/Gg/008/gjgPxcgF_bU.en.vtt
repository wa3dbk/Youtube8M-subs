the students learn the prepositions

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.669 
the students learn the prepositions
they're<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.599> to<00:00:24.689> create<00:00:24.869> phrases<00:00:25.529> and

they'd<00:00:30.060> practice<00:00:30.570> using<00:00:30.929> those<00:00:31.080> prepositions

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they'd practice using those prepositions

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.819 
they'd practice using those prepositions
so<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.450> play<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.930> game<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.500> what's

they can choose that board etc and it's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.810 
they can choose that board etc and it's
important<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.190> way<00:01:05.430> they're<00:01:05.700> going

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
important because this way they're going

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.280 
important because this way they're going
to<00:01:05.910> not<00:01:06.060> only<00:01:06.090> choose<00:01:06.540> their<00:01:06.780> breed<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> dog

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
so this is going to be their pet while
they're<00:01:10.890> doing<00:01:11.009> their<00:01:11.250> preposition<00:01:11.909> practice

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
during speech therapy

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.550 
during speech therapy
you'll<00:01:14.759> also<00:01:14.970> notice<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.689> three<00:01:16.049> color

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you'll also notice we have three color

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
you'll also notice we have three color
coded<00:01:16.979> decks<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.400> cards<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:18.000> remember<00:01:18.329> we

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
coded decks of cards now remember we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.530 
coded decks of cards now remember we
have<00:01:18.479> 72<00:01:19.170> cards<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.909> these<00:01:21.180> cards

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
have 72 cards in all with these cards

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
have 72 cards in all with these cards
we're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> practice<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.590> prepositions

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
we're going to practice the prepositions

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.630 
we're going to practice the prepositions
now<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> mentioned<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.869> 24<00:01:25.650> prepositions

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
now I mentioned we have 24 prepositions

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.910 
now I mentioned we have 24 prepositions
that<00:01:26.700> we're<00:01:26.909> targeting<00:01:27.150> each<00:01:27.960> preposition<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that we're targeting each preposition is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
that we're targeting each preposition is
targeted<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.640> each<00:01:30.030> card<00:01:30.509> deck<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.770> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
targeted in each card deck so if we have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.289 
targeted in each card deck so if we have
red<00:01:32.869> blue<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.079> green<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.939> means<00:01:36.119> we're

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
red blue and green that means we're

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
red blue and green that means we're
going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> target<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> preposition<00:01:37.590> three

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
going to target that preposition three

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
going to target that preposition three
times<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.520> three<00:01:38.759> different<00:01:39.060> contexts<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.290> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
times in three different contexts so it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.380 
times in three different contexts so it
gives<00:01:40.619> us<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> flexibility<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> learning<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
gives us the flexibility of learning and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
gives us the flexibility of learning and
having<00:01:42.600> multiple<00:01:42.869> practice<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> just

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
having multiple practice or we can just

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.700 
having multiple practice or we can just
learn<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> prepositions<00:01:45.719> by<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.079> deciding

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
learn the prepositions by just deciding

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.069 
learn the prepositions by just deciding
to<00:01:46.799> use<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.310> card<00:01:47.610> deck<00:01:47.850> during<00:01:48.390> our<00:01:48.630> session

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
to use one card deck during our session

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
to use one card deck during our session
then<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.189> will<00:01:50.369> choose<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> card<00:01:51.119> deck<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
then we will choose the card deck that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
then we will choose the card deck that
