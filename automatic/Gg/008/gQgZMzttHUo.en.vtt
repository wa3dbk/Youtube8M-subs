something<00:01:04.840> when<00:01:04.990> I<00:01:05.020> think<00:01:05.200> that's<00:01:05.350> not<00:01:05.500> too

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
something when I think that's not too

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.030 
something when I think that's not too
cheesy<00:01:05.950> actually<00:01:06.400> it<00:01:06.700> sounds<00:01:07.060> like<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.890> has

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
cheesy actually it sounds like it has

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.520 
cheesy actually it sounds like it has
more<00:01:09.220> than<00:01:09.280> mood<00:01:09.580> like<00:01:10.050> what's<00:01:11.050> happening

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
more than mood like what's happening

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.860 
more than mood like what's happening
with<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.860> background

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.840 

now<00:01:16.870> you<00:01:16.960> slide<00:01:17.230> it<00:01:17.410> over<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.680> same<00:01:18.010> shape

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.330 

this<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> G<00:01:22.330> chord<00:01:22.620> then<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:23.740> go<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.979> minor

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
this is a G chord then you go to a minor

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.880 
this is a G chord then you go to a minor
7<00:01:25.110> which<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.140> 0<00:01:26.610> 2<00:01:27.610> 0<00:01:28.620> 1<00:01:29.670> 10<00:01:30.670> 0

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
7 which is 0 2 0 1 10 0

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.250 
7 which is 0 2 0 1 10 0
you<00:01:33.760> hit<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.000> open<00:01:34.240> string<00:01:34.450> each<00:01:34.600> time<00:01:34.900> so<00:01:35.140> on

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
you hit the open string each time so on

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.880 
you hit the open string each time so on
here<00:01:35.409> this<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.590> actually<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.920> g6<00:01:36.340> chord<00:01:37.890> so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
here this is actually a g6 chord so

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.980 
here this is actually a g6 chord so
again<00:01:39.100> it's<00:01:39.280> F<00:01:39.430> major<00:01:39.700> 7<00:01:40.270> or<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.750> have<00:01:40.870> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
again it's F major 7 or you can have the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.880 
again it's F major 7 or you can have the
G<00:01:41.229> in<00:01:41.350> there

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.440 

shining<00:01:44.890> sounds<00:01:45.160> better<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.730> three<00:01:46.060> three

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
shining sounds better so three three

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.120 
shining sounds better so three three
zero<00:01:46.480> one<00:01:47.350> zero<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:48.040> not<00:01:48.370> hitting<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.760> string

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
zero one zero and not hitting the string

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.840 
zero one zero and not hitting the string
slide<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.280> over<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:53.020> now<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.700> relative<00:01:54.700> with

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
slide it over so now it's relative with

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:05.770 
slide it over so now it's relative with
a<00:01:54.910> capo<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.390> 5<00:01:55.630> 5<00:01:55.960> 0<00:01:56.800> 3<00:01:57.690> 0<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.360> then<00:02:01.480> 0<00:02:01.650> 2<00:02:02.650> 0<00:02:02.680> 1<00:02:03.640> 0

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
a capo it's 5 5 0 3 0 and then 0 2 0 1 0

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.499 
a capo it's 5 5 0 3 0 and then 0 2 0 1 0
and<00:02:06.560> sometimes<00:02:07.070> they<00:02:07.220> strum<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.610> twice<00:02:07.880> and

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
and sometimes they strum this twice and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.030 
and sometimes they strum this twice and
then<00:02:08.750> there's<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.960> pause<00:02:09.140> or<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.770> can<00:02:09.920> go

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
then there's a pause or you can go

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.250 
then there's a pause or you can go
sometimes<00:02:10.460> they<00:02:10.580> go<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:13.190> go<00:02:13.280> back<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.730> G

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.260 

you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.120 

sometimes<00:02:22.990> they<00:02:23.080> just<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.530> sometimes

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
sometimes they just do that sometimes

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:39.690 
sometimes they just do that sometimes
it's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.810 

this<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.090> two<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.390> those<00:02:42.700> Sophie<00:02:43.700> that
