would force Jennifer Swanson to get a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.650 
would force Jennifer Swanson to get a
mark<00:02:12.830> because<00:02:13.190> actually<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.060> she<00:02:14.210> got<00:02:14.300> nine

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
mark because actually if she got nine

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:34.840 
mark because actually if she got nine
out<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.560> could<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> tie<00:02:21.010> only<00:02:22.010> eight<00:02:22.220> count

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.400 

so<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:36.000> she'll<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:36.390> need<00:02:36.570> nine<00:02:36.810> pins<00:02:37.170> with

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
so now she'll just need nine pins with

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.750 
so now she'll just need nine pins with
Michelle<00:02:37.680> getting<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.070> eight<00:02:38.280> count<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:38.730> our
