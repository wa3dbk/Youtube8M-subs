00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.490
 refined or refined petroleum is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.680
 known to be found everywhere as well in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.470
 our textiles as well as ours 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760
 clothing 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 So there are more already in one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 predecessor video about synthetic fibers 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.859
 the last time with the viscose it went 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.720
 um are natural chemical fibers so 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.809
 made of cellulose and this time i want to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 you the synthetic chemical fibers 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.719
 imagine 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.620
 They are all that as polyester 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.570
 polyacrylic polyamide and the like 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 and, amazingly, that's us, yes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.199
 already seemingly for a very long time are surrounded 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.149
 the first patented at 19 30 40 novels 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.840
 and thus have this boy the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 How does it develop? 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 the chemical chemical fiber will become that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.780
 theoretical chemical fiber she will like 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 At the cellulose there is a spider 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.380
 the hostess put a music box 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.939
 I took care of a syringe 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 but there comes a playing mass 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.259
 into it when we design the the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.960
 nozzle can be like the one on the runway too 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.750
 have any experience and there will be 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.869
 a different composition 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.689
 polymers formed the thread from the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.320
 man made a tissue will recognize 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.500
 by the following as always with 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.210
 the fire 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.210
 i can do pure textile 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 and if that melts like plastic can 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.340
 you assume that this is about 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.369
 polyester polyimide green and the like 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.380
 that means it melts it bends 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 it is not true 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.100
 and that's what you actually recognize 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.170
 very well and that is important 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.909
 because by the different ones 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 chemical compositions in the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.459
 play ground, the decks, the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.720
 chemistry industry pretty much every fabric 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.930
 from the side ship imitat up to the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.000
 wool to super soft fluffy 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.260
 she can fluffily all of them with those 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.819
 that means it is already too 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.410
 check if no label trainers 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.480
 is or a man bought fabric or 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.440
 The silk is given as a gift 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.450
 cotton or is that just one 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.019
 then simply heat up the chemical fiber 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.600
 sticking is the case most of the time 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.530
 the advantages and disadvantages of synthetic 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.370
 chemical fibers and natural fibers too 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.030
 illustrate 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.370
 May I sincerely norbert you 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.760
 introduce nature 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:58.500
 hello new value of work and he will 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.500
 want to validly 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.930
 I am glad that I am here today 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.670
 can come to word about the wonderful 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.650
 properties of textiles from the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.510
 underline the chemical industry 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.970
 if you go from the old bath these are 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.460
 fibers the best and most durable 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.620
 at all 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.780
 They are super easy to keep in easy 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.970
 do not go in the washing machine with it 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.950
 by mutual agreement barely and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.110
 can also be with heat 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.980
 deform to pc and so on that is 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.260
 but great 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.480
 So I have to interject right away 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.920
 great that are stable 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.350
 because that's what they reveal 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.420
 not the better at all 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.010
 that's why she had recycled endlessly 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.540
 become 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.020
 besides, we are still absolute 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.580
 color and not the same from the weird 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.840
 umbrellas I bought last year 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.250
 he and he have all the worries in the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.860
 Sun has stood the both 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.990
 bleached well alright but im 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.730
 Cotton umbrellas would not 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.150
 survive a whole summer 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.230
 and apart from that are priced 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.170
 synthetic fibers are a lot cheaper 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.180
 all natural fibers 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.310
 That's why you will be happy with wool 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.200
 or cotton because then in addition to 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.450
 For example, the wool is still wool 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.620
 Washable without her coming in like 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.260
 Great 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.180
 then I have a wonderful wool 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.370
 characteristics that she sucks water and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.050
 that she makes a great body climate and 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.030
 then plastic inside is because the 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.950
 it prevents my body from getting well 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.540
 can evaporate and I no longer so 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.020
 sweats and then stinky for it like one 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.580
 sow 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.290
 I think he's the price 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.690
 argument behind it from the industry 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.790
 so that the clothes and fabrics cheaper 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.640
 become 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.500
 may be for it are synthetic fibers all the more 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.120
 more suitable for allergy sufferers because 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.430
 not so many pesticides are inside 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.530
 And besides, synthetic fibers can not 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.200
 mushrooms and create the following like that 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.390
 the whole natural fibers of the 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.780
 That's why they are very common 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.040
 used in medicine side had 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.860
 the same antibacterial 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.560
 Properties like a would come fibers 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.390
 keep too expensive 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.880
 and anyway that's problematic 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.380
 Chemical fibers is yes that they if you 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.780
 The washing machine is under you 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.760
 the mini advise gives and thus this 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.590
 April comes into the water that can not 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.040
 once from the sewage treatment plants 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.020
 be filtered out 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.400
 comes into the sea the fish eat the 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.770
 and we started plastic too 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.590
 eat 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.300
 Now, as you can see, the discussions are 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.890
 between chemistry and textile fibers even 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.290
 not so easy what the pros and cons 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.440
 are and I leave it to myself 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:36.790
 the decision what he buys and what he does 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.500
 not quite finished and extensive 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:44.430
 video is well tolerated and already 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.430
 is right to celebrate
