00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
really fast and it's really bad and then

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
really fast and it's really bad and then
it<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.400> sometimes<00:01:05.850> even<00:01:06.150> shuts<00:01:06.479> off

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
been working well so I'm pretty sure I'm

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960 
been working well so I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> new<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
gonna have to get a new one and then I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.340 
gonna have to get a new one and then I
don't<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.509> I'll<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.170> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
don't know what I'll do about like this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.350 
don't know what I'll do about like this
setup<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.860> how<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.250> record<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:41.759> drawings<00:01:42.180> cuz

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
setup of how well record my drawings cuz

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
setup of how well record my drawings cuz
that<00:01:42.570> camera<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.320> perfectly<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that camera was like perfectly in the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590 
that camera was like perfectly in the
way<00:01:44.399> where<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:44.939> put<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.420> on

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
way where I could like put it right on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
way where I could like put it right on
top<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.049> desk<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.369> other

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
top of my desk but for like other

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.830 
top of my desk but for like other
cameras<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.119> don't<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.630> gonna<00:01:48.720> have

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cameras I don't know if I'm gonna have

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.749 
cameras I don't know if I'm gonna have
to<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> exact<00:01:49.860> same<00:01:50.130> type<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
to get like the exact same type of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.450 
to get like the exact same type of
camera<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.360> left<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.409> yeah<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:53.189> basically

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
camera or left so yeah that's basically

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520 
camera or left so yeah that's basically
the<00:01:53.790> reason<00:01:54.060> why<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> haven't<00:01:54.659> had<00:01:54.869> many<00:01:55.049> videos

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the reason why I haven't had many videos

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.740 
the reason why I haven't had many videos
out<00:01:55.740> yet<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.329> might<00:01:57.719> be

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
out yet and I think I actually might be

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
out yet and I think I actually might be
able<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> squeeze<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> couple<00:01:59.130> more

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
able to squeeze like a couple more

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
able to squeeze like a couple more
videos<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.119> camera<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:00.899> not

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
videos out of this camera but I'm not

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
videos out of this camera but I'm not
really<00:02:01.140> sure<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.100> can't<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.579> say<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
really sure so I can't really say if I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.450 
really sure so I can't really say if I
can<00:02:03.540> or<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.259> gonna<00:02:04.409> try<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> few

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
can or not but I'm gonna try for a few

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.770 
can or not but I'm gonna try for a few
because<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.299> some

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
because I know I do have some

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.210 
because I know I do have some
speedpaints<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.560> trying<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.860> work<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
speedpaints I'm trying to work on so

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.980 
speedpaints I'm trying to work on so
yeah<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.700> that's<00:02:10.090> basically<00:02:10.330> what's<00:02:10.690> going

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
yeah and that's basically what's going

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.840 
yeah and that's basically what's going
on<00:02:11.110> for<00:02:11.350> like<00:02:11.380> traditional<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.100> stuff<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.580> do

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
on for like traditional and stuff I do

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.300 
on for like traditional and stuff I do
have<00:02:13.240> one<00:02:13.270> video<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.200> already<00:02:14.680> filmed

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
have one video that I already filmed

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.250 
have one video that I already filmed
from<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.640> while<00:02:15.850> ago<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:16.180> tutorial<00:02:16.690> about<00:02:16.960> like

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
from a while ago a tutorial about like

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.470 
from a while ago a tutorial about like
coloring<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.770> crayola<00:02:18.040> color<00:02:18.490> pencils<00:02:19.030> for

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
coloring with crayola color pencils for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.810 
coloring with crayola color pencils for
that<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:19.780> should<00:02:20.020> be<00:02:20.050> up<00:02:20.290> soon<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.920> then<00:02:21.550> yeah

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
that one should be up soon and then yeah

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.060 
that one should be up soon and then yeah
so<00:02:22.210> that's<00:02:22.390> basically<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.470> situation

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
so that's basically in the situation

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.890 
so that's basically in the situation
with<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.250> camera<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.270> then<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.660> other<00:02:25.810> thing

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
with the camera and then the other thing

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.780 
with the camera and then the other thing
is<00:02:26.110> obviously<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.920> traditional<00:02:27.370> I'm<00:02:27.460> working

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
is obviously for traditional I'm working

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.430 
is obviously for traditional I'm working
on<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> animation<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> can't<00:02:29.140> really<00:02:29.260> have

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
on the animation so I can't really have

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.040 
on the animation so I can't really have
many<00:02:29.590> speedpaints<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.910> um<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.570> guys<00:02:31.720> want

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
many speedpaints but um if you guys want

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.980 
many speedpaints but um if you guys want
me<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.940> like<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> speed<00:02:34.510> paint<00:02:34.780> or

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990
