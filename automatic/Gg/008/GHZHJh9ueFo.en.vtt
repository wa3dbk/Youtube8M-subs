let me show you what that sounds like

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.359 
let me show you what that sounds like
here<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:28.109> distorted<00:00:28.830> guitars<00:00:29.160> with

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
here are my distorted guitars with

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.979 
here are my distorted guitars with
nothing<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.820> them

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.670 

now<00:00:37.989> what<00:00:38.289> I<00:00:38.320> did<00:00:38.440> was<00:00:38.859> put<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.579> Randy<00:00:39.940> Esser<00:00:40.300> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
now what I did was put a Randy Esser and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.209 
now what I did was put a Randy Esser and
use<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.859> sidechain<00:00:42.480> functionality<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:44.469> find

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
use the sidechain functionality to find

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:53.689 
use the sidechain functionality to find
the<00:00:45.309> frequency<00:00:45.519> that's<00:00:45.969> too<00:00:46.180> harsh<00:00:46.449> like<00:00:47.109> this

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.219 

when<00:00:54.699> I<00:00:54.789> landed<00:00:55.149> right<00:00:55.329> around<00:00:55.539> 4<00:00:55.930> kilohertz

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
when I landed right around 4 kilohertz

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.529 
when I landed right around 4 kilohertz
so<00:00:57.190> I'll<00:00:57.250> bring<00:00:57.399> it<00:00:57.519> back<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:57.909> audio<00:00:58.180> and

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
so I'll bring it back to the audio and

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.090 
so I'll bring it back to the audio and
this<00:00:59.199> is<00:00:59.260> what<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.440> sounds<00:00:59.710> like<00:00:59.739> with<00:00:59.979> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
this is what it sounds like with the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.120 
this is what it sounds like with the
de-esser<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.019> want<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.259> brighten<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.740> so

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
de-esser now I want to brighten it up so

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.490 
de-esser now I want to brighten it up so
I<00:01:06.189> brought<00:01:06.430> up<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.759> API<00:01:07.119> EQ<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:08.110> give<00:01:08.259> it<00:01:08.350> some

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
I brought up the API EQ to give it some

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.490 
I brought up the API EQ to give it some
more<00:01:08.590> presence<00:01:09.100> I<00:01:09.310> added<00:01:09.670> about<00:01:10.479> 2<00:01:10.720> dB<00:01:11.050> at<00:01:11.080> 7

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
more presence I added about 2 dB at 7

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.850 
more presence I added about 2 dB at 7
kilohertz<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.220> 4<00:01:12.610> dB<00:01:12.970> at<00:01:13.240> 3<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.050> this<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.710> what

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
kilohertz and 4 dB at 3 and this is what

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.830 
kilohertz and 4 dB at 3 and this is what
it<00:01:14.950> sounds<00:01:15.220> like

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.310 

a<00:01:21.100> lot<00:01:22.100> better<00:01:22.250> in<00:01:22.429> my<00:01:22.460> opinion<00:01:22.939> if<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.719> take

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
a lot better in my opinion if you take

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.260 
a lot better in my opinion if you take
off<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.530> rent<00:01:24.859> yes<00:01:25.070> sir<00:01:25.280> then<00:01:25.789> it's<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:26.060> little

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
off the rent yes sir then it's a little

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.420 
off the rent yes sir then it's a little
too<00:01:26.390> harsh<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.869> sounds<00:01:27.079> like<00:01:27.170> this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.100 

with<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.580> render

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.180 

and<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:38.250> old<00:01:38.490> guitars<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.420> nothing<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.840> them

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.350 

so<00:01:43.190> as<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.400> can<00:01:43.520> see<00:01:43.580> that's<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.030> cool<00:01:44.180> way<00:01:44.300> to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
so as you can see that's a cool way to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360 
so as you can see that's a cool way to
add<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.570> lot<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.810> presence<00:01:45.320> without<00:01:45.920> getting

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
add a lot of presence without getting

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.450 
add a lot of presence without getting
too<00:01:46.460> much<00:01:46.580> harshness<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:48.160> here's<00:01:49.160> what<00:01:49.370> it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
too much harshness and here's what it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.150 
too much harshness and here's what it
sounds<00:01:49.700> like<00:01:49.760> in<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:49.970> mix
