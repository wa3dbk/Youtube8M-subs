00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.830
 Ladies and Gentlemen 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.420
 those of you who follow me on Twitter may already know that 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.650
 I next to a purposeful index finger last week, something with 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.709
 We have gained a lot in the future 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.410
 The buyer Clasico brings that is the cheaper alternative to 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.380
 the previous investment in Cooper Generator percent which also with this 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.500
 Club Belle delivered the transport safety locks on the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.380
 one side and of course the second also the light form can do that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.720
 bit the light softer than 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 Per cent that this would soon be the case Uli HoeneÃŸ makes with the left 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.910
 those with two prominent among the comrades are then the must 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 logically annular around the optical axis 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.260
 in the result I have one 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.650
 very very limp name or almost shadow free illumination achieved 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.699
 shines through this ring 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.280
 the last German from the outset from the optical axis all 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.109
 Surfaces facing the camera are at the same time effective Miyake 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.729
 shiny surfaces for example on clothes or in the face that 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.609
 To get the light right back into the optical axis very much 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.119
 dominant highlights 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.360
 I had very much 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.520
 unnatural actually artificial illumination when I use the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.410
 Marienplatz as Haug I put it 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.550
 and that suits me quite well for the pregnant swimwear shoot that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.900
 I intend to be here today 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.609
 I'm here with a good friend pulled backhoe they pulled out a bit 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.130
 May York Fed Informer 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.100
 and you would expect it at a bathing lake otherwise carries our model 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 today top round fine thread that is called Celle Sako 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.940
 inhibits &amp; Cie tie she is backed up for under the belt 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.700
 absolutely not matching swimming trunks 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.840
 let the stubbornness on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.420
 around this now anyway very so real and alienated look too 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.300
 reinforce and complete 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.500
 "Of course I have to take care of the right mood for Leek 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.780
 I hereby agree that for this we need the ambient light 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.330
 the flash comes together 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.120
 So I'm going to do a measurement for that 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.570
 Ambient light and get as a linden tree of 5 6 at a reading of 100 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.170
 and a 250 SLA shutter speed at these settings would be the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.950
 Background correctly exposed I would like there in the case 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.510
 Ambient light from the recording myself push out so I would like the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.669
 Darker background than it is in reality 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.489
 and that's why her the aperture on the camera instead of at least six 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.850
 Goals on blind 10 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.850
 what a two-thirds dazzle and about seal that and the guys do not 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.289
 that will come soon 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.709
 after that, then only one ring is needed 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.689
 Achieving your performance that's like the model in the foreground 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.929
 Aperture of 10 correctly exposed 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.419
 Japan I want to say let's go 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.999
 I've got the Mac or generator over my shoulder now 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.689
 hanged that it is a big advantage of the generator is relatively small with three 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.779
 Kilo still halfway to shoulders 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.109
 and who so I have the possibility in the compact system where 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.390
 I have everything with me 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.710
 also not flexible to move without I have to be afraid of any 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.399
 To stumble Karl Thumser 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.089
 triggered is the Blitz Generator today as always 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.299
 me with the mailing of Sky short scenes that also this radio remote control 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.579
 has built in so regulation of power since my hobby depth today it is 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.479
 many 20 to 70 millimeters 2 8l 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:18.719
 that today in the range of 24 to 35 millimeters, I mainly use them 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.139
 a small safety note may be on the sidelines 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.129
 actually of course but if you are with a mushroom generator the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.129
 High voltage leads in the water works then be careful that these 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.619
 Tweets generator does not get in contact with the water under you otherwise 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 very quickly become ugly and painful 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.729
 In the meantime, I also have a polarizing filter on the 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.539
 objectively screwed and the reflections on the surface slightly better 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:48.189
 to be able to control and color the sky even more dramatically 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.219
 All in all, I'm quite positively surprised by the picture of food 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.359
 which are possible with the blue Rinkes 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.849
 yes and before it would be the possible and last jump-off I say 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.569
 need now again on and in the sense certainly not
