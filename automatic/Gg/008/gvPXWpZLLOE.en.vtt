next<00:00:17.460> step<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.300> younger<00:00:18.660> players<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.080> start

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
next step the younger players we start

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.050

think the younger players and
unfortunately<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.720> my<00:00:24.869> opinion<00:00:25.230> some

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
unfortunately in my opinion some

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.990

remember your best teacher and cause of
all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> times<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> mere<00:01:45.930> being<00:01:46.140> tough<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
all the times the mere being tough I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.230 
all the times the mere being tough I
think<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> help<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> improve

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
think the you know the help you improve

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.109 
think the you know the help you improve
and<00:01:48.509> certainly<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.119> probably

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and certainly I can think of probably

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
and certainly I can think of probably
three<00:01:51.329> coaches<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:52.020> career<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.649> really

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
three coaches in my career that really

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.760 
three coaches in my career that really
did<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:53.970> impact<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.570> my<00:01:54.780> career<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
did have an impact on my career and the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.679 
did have an impact on my career and the
rest<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.399> by<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> wayside<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
rest go by the wayside and I think I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.980 
rest go by the wayside and I think I
said<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.860> certainly<00:01:59.729> our<00:01:59.790> strongest<00:02:00.360> our

benefits<00:02:23.689> are<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.219> unfortunately<00:02:25.219> we<00:02:25.849> are

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
benefits are that unfortunately we are

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.440 
benefits are that unfortunately we are
losing<00:02:26.269> some<00:02:26.599> players<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.019> academies<00:02:27.469> already

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
losing some players to academies already

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.970 
losing some players to academies already
you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.569> we'd<00:02:29.750> rather<00:02:29.959> keep<00:02:30.260> them<00:02:30.439> here<00:02:30.590> but

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
you know we'd rather keep them here but

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.339 
you know we'd rather keep them here but
when<00:02:31.939> professional<00:02:32.480> clubs<00:02:32.719> come<00:02:32.989> knocking

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
when professional clubs come knocking

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.399 
when professional clubs come knocking
you<00:02:34.040> know<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:34.609> kids<00:02:34.760> want<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.120> go<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.409> test

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
you know the kids want to go on test

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.610 
you know the kids want to go on test
that<00:02:37.040> environment<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.209> think<00:02:38.959> if<00:02:39.139> we<00:02:39.469> are

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
that environment and I think if we are

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.050 
that environment and I think if we are
doing<00:02:39.769> our<00:02:39.920> job<00:02:40.189> right<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.579> are<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:40.939> lose

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
doing our job right we are going to lose

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.660 
doing our job right we are going to lose
some<00:02:41.269> place<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:42.950> we<00:02:43.250> should<00:02:43.459> take

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
some place and so really we should take

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.899 
some place and so really we should take
that<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:43.879> a<00:02:43.909> compliment<00:02:44.859> we<00:02:45.859> have<00:02:46.340> 20<00:02:46.700> players

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
that as a compliment we have 20 players

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.819 
that as a compliment we have 20 players
available<00:02:47.180> per<00:02:47.569> year<00:02:47.810> group<00:02:48.049> with<00:02:48.620> two

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
available per year group with two

available per year group with two

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
coaches working in each groups or one to

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.580 
coaches working in each groups or one to
ten<00:02:53.030> ratio<00:02:53.569> which<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.930> will<00:02:54.109> not<00:02:54.230> get<00:02:54.439> that

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
ten ratio which you will not get that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
ten ratio which you will not get that
anywhere<00:02:54.829> I<00:02:55.189> really<00:02:55.849> believe<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.150> sort<00:02:56.720> of

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
anywhere I really believe that sort of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.209 
anywhere I really believe that sort of
small<00:02:57.019> groups<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.560> get<00:02:57.739> real<00:02:57.919> intern

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
small groups you can get real intern

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.599 
small groups you can get real intern
scorching<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.829> is<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> major<00:03:01.280> major

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
scorching so that is a major major
