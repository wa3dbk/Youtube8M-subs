garden the reason is why we use these
principles<00:00:24.470> in<00:00:24.800> planning<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.930> because<00:00:27.190> we're

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
principles in planning is because we're

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.980 
principles in planning is because we're
trying<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.550> get<00:00:28.700> as<00:00:28.850> much<00:00:29.030> production<00:00:29.510> as<00:00:29.840> we

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
trying to get as much production as we

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.250 
trying to get as much production as we
can<00:00:30.289> for<00:00:31.130> food<00:00:31.509> fruit<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.689> vegetables

shade variability these are all

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.669 
shade variability these are all
important<00:01:07.639> factors<00:01:08.060> when<00:01:08.090> looking<00:01:08.539> at<00:01:08.719> how<00:01:09.649> to

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
important factors when looking at how to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.379 
important factors when looking at how to
place<00:01:10.579> function<00:01:11.389> and<00:01:11.569> design<00:01:11.929> together<00:01:12.259> and

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:13.389 
place function and design together and

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.139 
place function and design together and
implementing<00:01:14.770> relative<00:01:15.770> location<00:01:16.609> to<00:01:16.999> the

implementing relative location to the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.139 
implementing relative location to the
design<00:01:18.310> now<00:01:19.310> we're<00:01:19.520> going<00:01:19.639> to<00:01:19.729> look<00:01:19.819> at<00:01:20.090> a

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
design now we're going to look at a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.480 
design now we're going to look at a
typical<00:01:20.359> suburban<00:01:20.869> backyard<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.310> we're

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
typical suburban backyard and we're

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.309 
typical suburban backyard and we're
going<00:01:22.609> to<00:01:22.670> come<00:01:22.880> up<00:01:22.909> with<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.270> concept<00:01:23.569> design

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
going to come up with a concept design

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.309 
going to come up with a concept design
for<00:01:24.829> that<00:01:24.859> in<00:01:25.429> basic<00:01:25.909> concept<00:01:26.420> design<00:01:26.869> there's

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
for that in basic concept design there's

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.639 
for that in basic concept design there's
a<00:01:27.409> few<00:01:27.619> things<00:01:27.859> that<00:01:28.159> help<00:01:28.399> us<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.759> create<00:01:28.999> our

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
a few things that help us to create our

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.080 
a few things that help us to create our
drawing<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.920> get<00:01:31.069> to<00:01:31.249> where<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:31.670> want<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.909> get

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
drawing to get to where we want to get

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.080 
drawing to get to where we want to get
to<00:01:32.619> things<00:01:33.619> that<00:01:33.679> are<00:01:33.799> handy<00:01:34.279> our<00:01:34.459> compass

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
to things that are handy our compass

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.249 
to things that are handy our compass
pencil<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.229> scale<00:01:37.159> ruler<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.969> a<00:01:38.569> lot<00:01:38.779> of<00:01:38.899> common

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
pencil a scale ruler and a lot of common

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.870 
pencil a scale ruler and a lot of common
sense<00:01:39.469> a<00:01:40.749> bit<00:01:41.749> of<00:01:41.869> paper<00:01:42.049> about<00:01:42.560> an<00:01:42.829> a3<00:01:43.490> as<00:01:43.669> I<00:01:43.819> do

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
sense a bit of paper about an a3 as I do

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.469 
sense a bit of paper about an a3 as I do
I<00:01:44.389> find<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.169> easier<00:01:45.319> because<00:01:45.770> then<00:01:45.859> you<00:01:46.130> can

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
I find it easier because then you can

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.870 
I find it easier because then you can
sketch<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.509> lot<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:47.959> information<00:01:48.679> on<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.889> large<00:01:49.729> a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
sketch a lot of information on a large a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.889 
sketch a lot of information on a large a
bit<00:01:50.029> of<00:01:50.179> paper<00:01:50.569> than<00:01:50.959> you<00:01:51.079> would<00:01:51.319> on<00:01:51.469> an<00:01:51.709> a4<00:01:52.899> so

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
bit of paper than you would on an a4 so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.349 
bit of paper than you would on an a4 so
one<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.109> the<00:01:54.259> first<00:01:54.289> steps<00:01:54.919> is<00:01:55.249> you<00:01:55.999> draw<00:01:56.209> an

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
one of the first steps is you draw an

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.019 
one of the first steps is you draw an
outline<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.840> your<00:01:57.079> property<00:01:57.819> place<00:01:58.819> the

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
outline of your property place the

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:03.479 
outline of your property place the
compass<00:01:59.450> on<00:01:59.599> the<00:02:00.079> drawing<00:02:01.539> flat<00:02:02.539> position

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489

work<00:02:04.489> out<00:02:04.789> where<00:02:05.029> North<00:02:05.329> is<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.959> place<00:02:06.499> north

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
work out where North is and place north

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.690 
work out where North is and place north
next<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.930> property<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.190> know<00:02:10.490> where

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
next to the property so you know where

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.390 
next to the property so you know where
your<00:02:10.820> orientation<00:02:11.480> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
your orientation is
