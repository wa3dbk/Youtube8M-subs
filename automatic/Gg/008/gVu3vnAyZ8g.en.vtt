00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.500
 to follow the punters and the ends 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.250
 how welcome are you to a new video 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.510
 let's talk about the preferences 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.640
 I had 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.350
 at the time of burning fat as you know the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.570
 well, in a person who was always 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.140
 it's super definite of nothing called a lot 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.280
 the attention in his spectacular physical and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 good in an interview that 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.270
 they asked if they were trying 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.410
 of reducing fat if you preferred to use 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.190
 choose or just normal cardio and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.780
 Well, I'm going to read, because it's a bit 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.999
 curious and he said he did not perform 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.829
 change within interview to 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.899
 ask him that if he preferred hit or 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.929
 simply normal cardio is where 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.390
 is none if your diet is at 100 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.519
 percent does not have to see the machine 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.819
 running is a simple case of calories 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.409
 consumed against calories burned 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.899
 logically if we get more calories 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.909
 of which more increase is the weight if 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.909
 consume fewer calories than most 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.910
 of accepting god help accelerate to 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.880
 burn the calories but if you're below 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.380
 of your caloric maintenance 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.390
 there is no real need to do any 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 cardio although it may result in the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.940
 much faster fat loss 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.370
 it may also be because catabolic 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.790
 not really as I said say yes 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.520
 you have a caloric deficit logically 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.700
 you will gradually lose weight and if 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.400
 you are taking more calories than those of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.900
 what you spend, logically, you will go 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.900
 Gaining weight does not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.159
 but good does not stop attracting attention 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.649
 that if I did not say I did not do cardio or the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.229
 spectacular physical and super-defined that 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.750
 I had not so good then one more time 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.750
 it shows that the importance that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.180
 has the power in this sport 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.960
 because it is already a superfood 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 strict 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.479
 you can reach a body not only 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.880
 muscular but also super defined 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.069
 yes you have to look at the calories that are 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.010
 consume the calories we burn 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.100
 daily and depending on the objective 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.860
 of each one you can go changing the way 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.110
 that guys nothing else this is one of those 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.180
