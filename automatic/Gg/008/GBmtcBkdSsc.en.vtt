00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
this diaphragm pump I'll show you how it

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.600 
this diaphragm pump I'll show you how it
goes<00:01:45.940> together<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:47.410> spring<00:01:47.860> fits<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.490> this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
goes together the spring fits in this

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.430 
goes together the spring fits in this
little<00:01:48.910> recess<00:01:49.270> actually<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:49.960> like<00:01:50.110> that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
little recess actually just like that

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.580 
little recess actually just like that
it's<00:01:51.430> got<00:01:51.610> four<00:01:52.530> slotted<00:01:53.530> screws<00:01:53.920> or<00:01:54.310> flathead

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
separate because they're a little bit

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.469 
separate because they're a little bit
longer<00:02:02.470> than<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.830> other<00:02:02.950> screws<00:02:03.479> there's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.690 

we're<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:55.750> try

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.340 

here<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.510> guy

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.940 

there<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:09.470> go

this feels a little hard this guy may be
the<00:03:15.620> booger<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.489> I'm<00:03:16.700> thinking<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.540> it's

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the booger but I'm thinking if it's

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.899 
the booger but I'm thinking if it's
working<00:03:17.959> one<00:03:18.349> sit<00:03:18.590> idle<00:03:18.890> carry<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.760> work

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
working one sit idle carry on and work

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.770 
working one sit idle carry on and work
through<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.569> guess<00:03:21.519> okay<00:03:22.549> but<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.450> needed<00:03:23.659> to

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
through I guess okay but I needed to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.000 
through I guess okay but I needed to
pull<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.079> all<00:03:24.200> apart<00:03:24.230> because<00:03:24.680> we're<00:03:24.860> gonna

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
pull it all apart because we're gonna

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.800 
pull it all apart because we're gonna
give<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.400> good<00:03:25.579> cleaning<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:29.120> was<00:03:29.629> the
