00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.610
 We are with the engineer Pablo Palacio 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.959
 of asbesubi prohuerta to address this 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.340
 issue of the efficient use of water in 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.509
 huerta pablo how are you doing because we do not 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.759
 told a little bit what we are 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.080
 watching now hello good day good here 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.369
 We are in a white berry neighborhood 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.770
 most recent August in the garden 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.570
 community where we are trying to 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.970
 see a little how is an irrigation team 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.769
 drip for light in use 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.929
 efficient water the irrigation equipment is 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.410
 one more tool that would improve this 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.790
 use the others should be a good 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.589
 wetland in soil profile and a 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.839
 multi type coverage to avoid that 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.670
 operation that the irrigation equipment achieves 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.019
 on the floor that way the plant 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.510
 I would only use the necessary water 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.220
 in this case the irrigation equipment more or 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.869
 less as was conformed in this 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.210
 case we have an irrigation team that is 

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:51.940
 food directly on the network has a 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.650
 front of 25 meters of water that would 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.019
 much the orchard and to which 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.119
 connect the hoses on the sides 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.189
 where are the bouncers every 33 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.809
 centimeters on those sides of what 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.180
 what it does is plant and plant 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.470
 plants near the drip for which the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.020
 plant is going to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.190
 supply water and some things that the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.570
 people have to keep in mind because 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.310
 we can come to think that someone 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.510
 wants to install a system of this more 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.220
 beyond the contact that may have 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.650
 after the program or the micro that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.720
 things would have to take into account good 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.640
 first it makes them a good design to see that 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.670
 the space that does not have the garden what 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.440
 type of design I can get to do yes or 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.480
 yes base on any filter 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.920
 filter system so that the water that I 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.110
 I am supplying through by the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.840
 chronometer does not stop me from obstructing or covering 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.310
 the edges the drippers and a maintenance 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.320
 monthly observing that the droppers 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.750
 work well that do not clog clean 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.930
 the filter that is a simple movement 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.030
 it's simple we're here on the team 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.950
 of irrigation pablo seems important to me as 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.320
 you start and if it's the first time you go 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.970
 to water once you achieve install the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.229
 irrigation equipment if you are on the orchard 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.240
 the first one that was left in system is 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.490
 purging it implies that I have to 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.290
 open the taps that you have all the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.450
 water system and take out all the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.400
 possible air that I have left as 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.530
 we do it on the front itself 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.440
 that opens the tap remove the plugs and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.880
 wait for the front of the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.810
 watering once you face full of 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.700
 water network 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.709
 we close the plugs and we come to the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.230
 drip hose each of this 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.120
 drip way have to be open to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.100
 along the furrow until it's 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.630
 waiting out the water once 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.090
 the water comes out by the same me what 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.250
 achieved is to displace as much as possible 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.350
 camera that I had left and once it 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.209
 then that assures me proceed to 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.489
 close it with a stopper or if with 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.250
 turning the hose and adapting it 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.080
 with wire like in this case this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.630
 way I would achieve 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.370
 no air remains in the drip hose and 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.980
 only the drippers will come out 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 corresponding water 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.310
 We are with Rosa RodrÃ­guez and one of the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.230
 coordinators here of the space of the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 garden and we would like you to tell us 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.030
 rose in which the orchard changed from the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.349
 moment they put the system of 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.690
 irrigation 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.150
 good change much because we have this 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.610
 we had very little water for the garden 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.620
 is over with the summer drought that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.840
 I did not know anything, we did not have many 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.910
 problems instead now this with the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.079
 drip irrigation we have the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.299
 irrigated garden also this we have the 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.000
 ease that we can go to 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.329
 house leave a sector of the garden 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.609
 watering the next day we come off one 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.160
 that is, we close one and open the other and 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.890
 It is watered and is above water 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.170
 we saved because we did not spend even half 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.670
 of the water that we used before because before 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.769
 we had to come to water for the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.200
 grooves and now a lot of water 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.670
 that was throwing that implied involved 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.500
 that you are at the time of watering 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.569
 those who are instead with the irrigation by 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.150
 drip not because we left open 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.920
 this good until now we came and what 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.770
 we would have closed the other and so not 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.990
 we would go but it is much easier 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.000
 you save a lot more water and it 's very 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.110
 important to us all that the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.450
 production does not have to have improved 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.100
 successfully and the production itself because you 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.620
 imagine we open up irrigation 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.600
 drip and plant watering per watt 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.360
 water specifically what is 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.040
 sowed because as drip irrigation not 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.650
 a belly is spread for the furrow 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.610
 above the furrow what needs nothing 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.080
 plus 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.820
 as we always say Pablo who 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.170
 Exactly the closest inta 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.760
 there the technicians are going to be 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.950
 advise a little more of the designs 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.280
 some advice and good whatever 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.280
 necessary
