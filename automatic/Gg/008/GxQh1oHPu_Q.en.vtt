00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.370
 telepizza launches the triple now you 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.139
 We take three pizzas wherever you want 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.969
 medium for seven euros each the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.889
 triple telepizza and we take them 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.060
 seven euros each one telepizza the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.060
 secret is in the dough 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.170
 the rival because they have not created us danger 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.030
 we are attending 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.400
 we have had our options we have 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.640
 he managed to put volleyball and in the end 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.110
 you have two options and then a rival 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.110
 in a play that you do 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.700
 we can not give 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.350
 good this team 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 until 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.300
 prepare a match in the 73rd without 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 in the end what is worth are not all other 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.150
 option that we would like and nothing not now 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.790
 is to try to rest and try 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.670
 recover both physically and mentally 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.799
 and nothing 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 without having to get registered with 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.180
 door the next phase 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.290
 again we are having luck of the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.090
 dynamic as it does not accompany I also think 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.090
 that the team deserved something more but 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.650
 well the result is what is three 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.170
 points 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.090
 take advantage of the break also for 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.160
 rest to recover strength to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.310
 recover people and especially change the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.040
 dynamic 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.950
 that suits us well, we do not need 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:00.409
 this stop back if we have proposed a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.299
 team that likes to have value 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.469
 and they knew they could press them because 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.090
 in these two courses his part between 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.549
 week but good 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 we have led the party in the rhythm 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.220
 we have had even more expensive occasions 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.720
 that they 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:21.940
 in the end that has been but has scored goal 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.230
 to zero and if nothing 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 within the bad can come in handy for 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.590
 that for the people for whom we have 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 had charge we can recover 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.240
 selectable that gives time of the year to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 The same team 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.140
 you have to get something out 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 we carry 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 10 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.090
 we are doing it 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.630
 now last year we reach the quality 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.300
 spiritual 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.410
 why 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.410
 when well 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.880
 as I say if a couple is 10 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.400
 over there 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.030
 this week you disconnect from the life of 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 the people of everything and recover in 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.510
 The whole game 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 before 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.040
 life
