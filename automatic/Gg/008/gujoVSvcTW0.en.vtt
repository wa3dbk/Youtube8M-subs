00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.340
 for some reason they put me here together with 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.240
 someone at least quickly 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.599

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.890

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 chatting at home first thing is not all true 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.670
 some of them need to chat 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.629
 let's say 2 these things and this place 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.629

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.750

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.770
 love the tracks let's have to give 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.770
 run a little 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.880
 Leponki not bad at all so good 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.930
 through things here 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:39.170
 dropped ingot and see there is still 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:42.710
 lighter so helmet take a topic i'm so 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.490
 I want a lighter how can I get a helmet 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.400
 you can throw out all the lighter have it 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.840
 also throw out 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.479
 Now I have to watch fishing rods at home. 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.170
 look was not there 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:01.460
 okay, I will run well without a fishing rod 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 that there broke into the truck here at least 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.940
 came out not the only winner well 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.600
 of course they were all dressed 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.700
 but no less so all the axes here 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.120
 will drop 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 You can reset it by this. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.440
 that's all normal shoes now 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.220
 i have a golden apple 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.470
 besides it is necessary to get it. 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.570
 so here we will check this house now 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.940
 he is also very good in him but although 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.570
 when somehow I ran here and found 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.230
 here only skin that is unknown what in 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.820
 this time right now again maybe this one 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:59.140
 became worse than it used to be so someone here 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:05.080
 ran and then ran a little like that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.959
 Now we will kill very quickly 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.340
 I wonder did not fall but there is a fire 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.920
 to use and burn 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:20.110
 it 's all about the great can be burned too 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:24.430
 we will warm ourselves by the fire 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.780
 now check what is left here yes 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.200
 Of course there may have nothing there 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.200
 in general there is also a very good ha all 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 still there are things there someone ran 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:44.170
 I saw out of the corner of my eye and he dressed it 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:50.489
 not bad look there is a fishing rod 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:53.650
 I have no sensors , someone else is running 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.040
 so 9 arrows all arrows spend i don't want 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.370
 and how good you too don't want without 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.370
 fishing rods 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 so missed okay never mind all the same 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.250
 try not to do an hour melee 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.900
 there meat was a sure sign of mine 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.950
 victories maybe not there someone else 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.950
 running in front 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:34.110
 it turns out this is not a team I once started with 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:36.949
 fight it right and continue well he 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.949
 so stopped 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.790
 such and here archery tactics 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:53.080
 in my tactics especially no 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:56.070
 arrows fly everything means good lighters 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.000
 with which I am going to use 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.610
 one already used 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.970
 and now you can just finish it gold 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.180
 apple stew or not like nobody 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:16.930
 go by the way this guy was a hyp 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:23.260
 diamond so when can you wear such 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:25.840
 things well and reset everything else everything 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.550
 only two arrows I have is the same 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.030
 few 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.880
 here are two more things I was probably lying 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.650
 twist myself now 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.650
 started the sword and from the remaining ingots where 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.070
 they also don't know what to do or lighters 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.120
 I'd rather make arrows arrows probably 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:53.580
 It will now be more useful to me for 28 pieces 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:57.880
 one does not go for this type of'll fix 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.820
 here so it will decompose as i love 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.079
 go lies another kid 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:12.999
 left out of these 5 people 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:17.649
 This team is obtained so I do not know on 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:20.049
 whom to attack so let's probably bye 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:26.169
 that I will not attack just look with 

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:28.989
 side will throw everything happening 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:34.419
 somehow reluctant that I usually dark 

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:39.329
 only when i need to and now 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.329
 I do not need how to become them c I do not want 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:46.449
 there must be a tactic everywhere 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.629
 My tactic is my thought 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.249
 nets and make almost dungeon only 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.039
 necessary cases 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:57.639
 because why throw then when 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:07:03.759
 Tim on the contrary happen to me to go 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:05.259
 wall is our Tim too but they figure 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:11.339
 water it is so against such kim these 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:11.339
 I want goals like this 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:26.379
 Now you can get closer 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:26.379
 try will be oh fine diamond is 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:38.360
 so so so well ka here it was not very 

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:41.839
 well that he attacked me but 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.419
 at least everything seems to be all right 

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:50.329
 only one diamond and everything turns out only 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:54.259
 two left over now 

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:58.209
 where they ran turns commands 

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:58.209
 here there is no meat not against each other 

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:05.139
 you can not merge through that now 

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:08.689
 the end of the game will begin 

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:12.049
 funny here we had this today 

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:13.669

00:08:12.049 --> 00:08:15.709
