okay one of the things to remember with
the<00:00:07.170> vapor<00:00:07.350> system<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:07.980> don't<00:00:08.130> want<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the vapor system is you don't want to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.590 
the vapor system is you don't want to
have<00:00:08.430> to<00:00:08.550> work<00:00:08.700> too<00:00:08.850> hard<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.270> don't<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.540> to

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
have to work too hard you don't want to

have to work too hard you don't want to
have<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.809> be<00:00:09.930> scrubbing<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.590> let<00:00:10.770> the<00:00:10.889> heat<00:00:11.070> do

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
have to be scrubbing you let the heat do

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.070 
have to be scrubbing you let the heat do
the<00:00:11.430> work<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.880> also<00:00:12.480> don't<00:00:12.719> want<00:00:12.930> to<00:00:12.990> have

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
to be bending so we're going to use the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.850 
to be bending so we're going to use the
right<00:00:15.180> number<00:00:15.539> of<00:00:15.570> extension<00:00:16.199> tubes<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.710> what

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
right number of extension tubes for what

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.439 
right number of extension tubes for what
we're<00:00:17.039> doing<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.640> case<00:00:17.880> I'm<00:00:18.119> doing<00:00:18.150> the

we're doing in this case I'm doing the
floor<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.289> where<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.440> going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.800> use<00:00:19.920> two

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
floor so where I'm going to use two

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
floor so where I'm going to use two
extension<00:00:21.300> tubes<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.690> that<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:21.930> bending

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
extension tubes so that I'm not bending

if you're a vacuuming and we're letting
the<00:00:37.620> heat<00:00:37.859> penetrate<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.030> pores<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the heat penetrate the pores of the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.009 
the heat penetrate the pores of the
floor<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.699> does<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> great<00:00:42.149> job<00:00:42.269> doesn't

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:48.569 
will actually do a far better job than

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.229 
will actually do a far better job than
wet<00:00:48.809> mopping<00:00:49.159> when<00:00:50.159> we're<00:00:50.339> done<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.909> can<00:00:51.059> see

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
hard with this we're gonna let the heat

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
hard with this we're gonna let the heat
do<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> work<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> stainless<00:01:13.530> steel<00:01:13.710> pad

temperatures<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.660> were<00:03:56.780> working<00:03:56.989> at<00:03:57.320> and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
temperatures that were working at and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.949 
temperatures that were working at and
how<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:58.340> wood<00:03:58.550> used<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.060> other<00:03:59.209> surfaces<00:03:59.780> we

gonna see me down on my knees because I
don't<00:04:18.340> want<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.959> too<00:04:20.169> hard<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.530> work<00:04:20.620> a

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
don't want to it's too hard to work a

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.980 
don't want to it's too hard to work a
tool<00:04:20.979> taking<00:04:21.400> out<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.549> spot<00:04:21.850> standing<00:04:22.360> up<00:04:22.510> so

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
tool taking out a spot standing up so

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.510 
tool taking out a spot standing up so
we're<00:04:23.110> actually<00:04:23.229> gonna<00:04:23.500> get<00:04:23.680> down<00:04:23.950> where<00:04:24.400> we

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
we're actually gonna get down where we

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.570 
we're actually gonna get down where we
can<00:04:24.669> work<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.360> spot<00:04:25.570> easily<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.550> a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
can work the spot easily if I have a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.190 
can work the spot easily if I have a
spot<00:04:27.910> we<00:04:28.120> don't<00:04:28.300> really<00:04:28.389> have<00:04:28.600> spots<00:04:28.900> here<00:04:29.110> in

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
spot we don't really have spots here in

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.659 
spot we don't really have spots here in
the<00:04:29.290> carpet<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.770> what<00:04:29.950> I'm<00:04:30.040> going<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.340> do<00:04:30.520> is

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
the carpet so what I'm going to do is

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.340 
the carpet so what I'm going to do is
we're<00:04:30.850> just<00:04:31.030> gonna<00:04:31.270> have<00:04:31.479> an<00:04:31.570> imaginary<00:04:31.990> spot

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
we're just gonna have an imaginary spot

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.500 
we're just gonna have an imaginary spot
so<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.560> can<00:04:32.830> show<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.100> how<00:04:33.370> we<00:04:33.430> would<00:04:33.580> go<00:04:34.479> about

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
so I can show you how we would go about

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.540 
so I can show you how we would go about
taking<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.200> out<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:36.040> first<00:04:36.280> thing<00:04:36.430> I'm

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
taking that out the first thing I'm

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.310 
taking that out the first thing I'm
going<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.790> do<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.120> I've<00:04:37.270> taken<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.720> nozzle<00:04:38.169> off

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
going to do is I've taken the nozzle off

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.650 
going to do is I've taken the nozzle off
of<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:39.400> water<00:04:39.700> coming<00:04:40.120> out<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.360> here<00:04:40.540> is

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
of this the water coming out of here is

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.800 
of this the water coming out of here is
a<00:04:40.690> little<00:04:41.050> warmer<00:04:41.850> at<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:43.060> longer<00:04:43.630> distance

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
a little warmer at a longer distance

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.350 
a little warmer at a longer distance
it's<00:04:44.560> also<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.889> little<00:04:45.130> wetter<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.150> water

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
it's also a little wetter but the water

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.969 
it's also a little wetter but the water
coming<00:04:46.720> out<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.960> here<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.139> actually<00:04:47.590> going<00:04:47.800> to

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
coming out of here is actually going to

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.379 
coming out of here is actually going to
clean<00:04:48.220> better<00:04:48.460> than<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.790> water<00:04:48.940> coming<00:04:49.270> out

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
clean better than the water coming out

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.360 
clean better than the water coming out
of<00:04:49.510> your<00:04:49.630> tap<00:04:49.840> because<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.860> temperatures

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
of your tap because of the temperatures

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.129 
of your tap because of the temperatures
we're<00:04:51.580> heating<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:51.970> water<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.389> about<00:04:52.630> 300

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
we're heating the water to about 300

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.080 
we're heating the water to about 300
degrees<00:04:53.200> we're<00:04:54.040> taking<00:04:54.370> all<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.700> minerals

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
degrees we're taking all the minerals

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.240 
degrees we're taking all the minerals
out<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.389> the<00:04:55.450> water<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:56.229> this<00:04:56.320> water<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.860> wet<00:04:57.100> or

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
out of the water so this water is wet or

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.640 
out of the water so this water is wet or
water<00:04:57.460> much<00:04:57.790> like<00:04:57.820> when<00:04:58.540> you<00:04:58.630> add<00:04:58.780> laundry

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
water much like when you add laundry

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.070 
water much like when you add laundry
soap<00:04:59.889> to<00:05:00.070> your<00:05:00.220> clothes<00:05:00.760> your<00:05:01.600> clothes<00:05:01.840> wash

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
soap to your clothes your clothes wash

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.290 
soap to your clothes your clothes wash
you're<00:05:02.740> making<00:05:03.130> your<00:05:03.250> water<00:05:03.460> wetter<00:05:03.790> so<00:05:04.120> it'll

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
you're making your water wetter so it'll

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.030 
you're making your water wetter so it'll
force<00:05:04.540> out<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.870> dirt<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.080> that's<00:05:05.770> what<00:05:05.919> we're

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
force out the dirt and that's what we're

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.010 
force out the dirt and that's what we're
gonna<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.400> I'm<00:05:07.180> going<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.419> first<00:05:07.600> turn<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:07.930> on

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
gonna do I'm going to first turn it on

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.710 
gonna do I'm going to first turn it on
over<00:05:08.289> this<00:05:08.440> pile<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:09.990> any<00:05:11.250> extra<00:05:12.419> moisture<00:05:13.419> I

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
over this pile of any extra moisture I

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.659 
over this pile of any extra moisture I
might<00:05:13.960> have<00:05:14.229> in<00:05:15.010> a<00:05:15.070> couple<00:05:15.430> different

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
might have in a couple different

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.510 
might have in a couple different
directions<00:05:15.880> along<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.810> spot<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.250> reason

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
directions along the spot and the reason

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.950 
directions along the spot and the reason
why<00:05:18.639> we<00:05:18.789> do<00:05:18.940> this<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.150> we<00:05:19.450> want<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:19.750> see<00:05:19.870> if

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
why we do this is we want to see if

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.090 
why we do this is we want to see if
that's<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.200> protein<00:05:20.650> stain<00:05:20.979> or<00:05:21.520> if<00:05:21.910> it's<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.330> a

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
that's a protein stain or if it's just a

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.890 
that's a protein stain or if it's just a
some<00:05:24.100> soil<00:05:24.370> mud<00:05:24.820> things<00:05:25.180> like<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.570> coffee

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
some soil mud things like that coffee

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.230 
some soil mud things like that coffee
coke<00:05:26.380> those<00:05:26.950> we<00:05:27.160> can<00:05:27.310> take<00:05:27.490> out<00:05:27.700> without<00:05:28.030> any

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
coke those we can take out without any

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.480 
coke those we can take out without any
chemical<00:05:29.169> but<00:05:29.350> if<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.740> protein<00:05:30.190> stain
