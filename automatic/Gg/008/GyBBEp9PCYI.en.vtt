00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.939
 Hello October friends 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.450
 my name is 201 league this is my first tutorial today I am going to show you how 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.450
 create esprit is for him with tere strike 1 points 6 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:15.379
 I wanted to do it like I do not see any video showing his followers 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.949
 we visited two programs 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.749
 we can wish them 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.749
 jelinek left them in the description of the video 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.530
 and japan 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.490
 music this is the link of the page I show you if you want to copy it 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.800
 I go crazy that we discard them Cesc Fabregas Ramirez will appear these two 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 folders 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 here the vote opens the first folder 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.250
 then open this file 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 let's become libya 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 carla folder where they have installed in antwerp strike 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.140
 cs explain 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 after the face 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.520
 and there will be any oversight that want life 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.920
 everything pointed to a final agreed in his browser 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.690
 and which he revealed 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
 I kept it on the desk 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.320
 then I talked to Prince Albert with any program to 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.220
 avoid drawings 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.860
 ducati they change what they want but I do not because the changes 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.830
 johnson 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.140
 port st then ask them if they want it 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.540
 and you put pressure 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.110
 I propose that we because I do not want to change both expelled in the second 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 binder 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.750
 then 15 meters 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 so they look at the xxii tournament 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.679
 act on the second 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.579
 after two strong 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.669
 by changing the law 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.889
 program files with three triples that is the students writing but here 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.889
 they look for the file called is mÃ­ster scottish 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.809
 india 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.809
 how do you see that is the artist's life 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.009
 click on soft pmp 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.979
 and they keep it where you want 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
 I the guardians 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 and they take him away as they want as they see me I wanted his views 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.209
 where they want with the same name then they copy it and they will ask for it in the folder 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.279
 call esprit from the csd 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.650
 and history 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.650
 has the file installed 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.009
