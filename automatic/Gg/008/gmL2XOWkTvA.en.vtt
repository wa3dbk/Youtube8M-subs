this<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.670> springform<00:03:21.239> tin<00:03:21.390> that's<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.930> team

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
this in a springform tin that's a team

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.960 
this in a springform tin that's a team
that<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.470> base<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.100> sides<00:03:23.280> come<00:03:23.610> off<00:03:23.760> I

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that the base and the sides come off I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.900 
that the base and the sides come off I
strongly<00:03:24.750> recommend<00:03:25.340> placing<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> cake<00:03:26.640> tin

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
strongly recommend placing the cake tin

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.850 
strongly recommend placing the cake tin
onto<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> baking<00:03:27.810> tray<00:03:28.019> before<00:03:28.440> putting<00:03:28.739> it

onto a baking tray before putting it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.170 
onto a baking tray before putting it
into<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.100> oven<00:03:29.340> because<00:03:29.459> sometimes<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
into the oven because sometimes the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.490 
into the oven because sometimes the
butter<00:03:30.329> can<00:03:30.540> seep<00:03:30.780> out<00:03:30.930> through<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> cracks

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
butter can seep out through the cracks
