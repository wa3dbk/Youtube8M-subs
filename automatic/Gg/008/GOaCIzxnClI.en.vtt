00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
rest of the bag is just coated canvas so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
rest of the bag is just coated canvas so
as<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.610> inside<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
as you can see inside it's just like a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.620 
as you can see inside it's just like a
plain<00:01:39.869> 12<00:01:40.350> color<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.670> fabric<00:01:42.270> but

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
plain 12 color and it's just fabric but

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
plain 12 color and it's just fabric but
the<00:01:42.750> outside<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.259> coated<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.009> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the outside is coated so that it's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.800 
the outside is coated so that it's
water-resistant<00:01:45.119> obviously<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:45.720> want

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
water-resistant obviously you don't want

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.240 
water-resistant obviously you don't want
to<00:01:45.960> dunk<00:01:46.229> your<00:01:46.409> bag<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.770> water<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.159> don't

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
want to carry it in the pouring rain but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.550 
want to carry it in the pouring rain but
it<00:01:50.520> does<00:01:50.820> wipe<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.320> case

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it does wipe down really well in case

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.399 
it does wipe down really well in case
some<00:01:52.740> someone<00:01:53.399> else<00:01:53.729> spill<00:01:54.509> something<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
some someone else spill something on it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.810 
some someone else spill something on it
then<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.799> don't<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> worry<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
then you don't have to worry that the
bag<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.600> ruined<00:01:57.840> unlike<00:01:58.500> with

real leather or dull
blender<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.710> I've<00:02:01.830> actually<00:02:02.010> inside<00:02:02.790> my

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
blender now that I've actually inside my

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.450 
blender now that I've actually inside my
bag<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.870> I<00:02:03.900> don't<00:02:04.290> carry<00:02:04.590> too<00:02:04.830> much<00:02:05.190> around

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.250 
bag so I don't carry too much around
with<00:02:05.640> me<00:02:05.760> but<00:02:06.270> first<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.720> be<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.900> pair<00:02:07.230> of

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
with me but first would be a pair of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.040 
with me but first would be a pair of
sunglasses<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.729> always<00:02:09.000> carry<00:02:09.240> sunglasses

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sunglasses I always carry sunglasses

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.810 
sunglasses I always carry sunglasses
around<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.740> are<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.250> old<00:02:11.400> Chanel

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.460 
around these are really old Chanel
sunglasses<00:02:12.600> I've<00:02:12.840> had<00:02:13.050> them<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.230> years

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

sunglasses I've had them for years
pretty<00:02:14.340> scratched<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.870> work<00:02:16.170> really

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
pretty scratched up but they work really

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.440 
pretty scratched up but they work really
well<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.240> they're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
well and I just think that they're

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.990 
well and I just think that they're
really<00:02:18.690> classic<00:02:19.200> shapes<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:20.490> some<00:02:20.730> places

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
really classic shapes so at some places

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.850 
really classic shapes so at some places
you<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.360> still<00:02:21.570> find<00:02:21.780> them<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.740> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you can still find them I like that the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.160 
you can still find them I like that the
logo<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.670> small<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.300> don't<00:02:24.570> really<00:02:24.870> like

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
logo is really small I don't really like

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.230 
logo is really small I don't really like
things<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.709> are<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.010> blinged<00:02:26.490> out<00:02:26.730> next

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
things that are very blinged out next

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.060 
things that are very blinged out next

bisque I adore this powder and it is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
bisque I adore this powder and it is
great<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:34.950> touch-ups<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.670> doesn't

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
great for touch-ups because it doesn't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.420 
great for touch-ups because it doesn't
get<00:02:36.090> cakey<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.959> before<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.320> block<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.980> always

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
get cakey but before I block I always

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.790 
get cakey but before I block I always
use<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.730> cleaning<00:02:39.300> clear<00:02:39.630> oil<00:02:40.020> absorbing

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
use my cleaning clear oil absorbing

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.620 
use my cleaning clear oil absorbing
sheets<00:02:41.160> which<00:02:41.400> instantly<00:02:42.030> removes<00:02:42.420> excess
