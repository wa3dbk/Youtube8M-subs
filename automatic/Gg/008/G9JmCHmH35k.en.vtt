00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:05.038
(hums)

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:07.808
(phone ringing)

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.644
Mm, hey butthole,
what's up?

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.312
Girl, did Bobby Skeltis
ever end up letting

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.680
you have sex with him?

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.282
Why? No.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.817
Okay good, Laura just
told me he has herpes.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.285
So...

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.820
Oh.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:23.357
Well, no, that is a big relief
because no, I did not.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.459
Okay, no, I just wanted
to let you know.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.060
Oh my God,
oh no, no, no!

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.429
My God, no!

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:32.432
Please, God, let me not
have herpes, please!

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.838
Well, well, well.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.306
Look who it is.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.941
God?

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.944
Do you remember when the last
time I heard from you was?

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.647
It was probably pretty recently
when my friend Tig got cancer.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.382
Pretty sure
I reached out then.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.318
No, it was seven years ago
when you were rooting for

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.254
the Green Knight
at Medieval Times.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.856
Oh.

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.691
Well, God, thank you so much
for coming through for me

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.326
that night.
(man)
You're welcome.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.962
This guy, Bobby Skeltis,
that you slept with?

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.630
What are you doing?

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.532
I know, I know.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.067
I can do so much better,
you're right.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.536
I didn't say that.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:10.871
Oh.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.942
You know, 70% of people
who reach out to me

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:18.645
are having
a herpes scare.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:22.082
Why should
I help you?
Okay.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.317
That's a fair question.
Yeah.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.585
Okay.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.987
Um, so I'm kind of like,
a public figure now.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.989
Mm.
Like a role model?

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.559
So if some young girl saw me
buying Valtrex or something,

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.862
it would be like, a thing.
Right.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:37.264
A thing, hmm.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.233
Like that earthquake
in Peru yesterday

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.934
that killed
9,000 people.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.903
Oh my God, I hope
no one was hurt.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.905
Oh, gosh.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.575
I really need to stop
making so many white girls.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.712
Let me be honest
with you, okay?

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.847
You did get herpes,
you already have it.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.316
No!
Yes.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.952
Now for me to
undo your herpes,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.890
I have to create balance in
the universe, you understand?

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.491
Totally.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.695
I'd have to kill off an entire
village in Uzbekistan.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.330
Yeah, whatever
you think is best.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.534
Do it.
You'll also have to
sacrifice something.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:14.868
Oh my God, name it.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.303
Okay.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.906
You need to stop
drinking.
Pass.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.674
How about stop
using hair spray?

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.743
The aerosol is very bad
for the environment.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.344
Could I just
like, blow you?

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.680
I'm gay.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.482
So?
Jesus Christ.

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.984
How about you just
call your mother

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.085
a little bit
more often?

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.787
That's an easy one.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:37.724
Mmm... what is
herpes exactly?

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.793
It's an outbreak,
like, once a year?

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.595
Yeah.
I don't know.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.297
I think I'll
just take it.
Okay, fine.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.966
Fine, herpes it is.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.702
Now don't forget to call all
the men that you've slept with.

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.304
It's the moral
thing to do, right?

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.306
Oh my God, of course.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.741
Duh.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.348
Amy.
Mmm!

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:02.649
I can see everything.

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:04.284
What? Oh now?

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.253
You want me to
do it now?
Yes!

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.788
Okay, well, you weren't
clear about that.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.423
I'll do it
right now.
Sor-ee.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:12.392
I'm sorry,
I'll do it now.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.399
Boop boop boop.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.969
Boop boop...

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:28.609
♪ Jeans into
jean shorts ♪

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.477
What?

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.713
I'm sorry you changed seasons
and now I need jean shorts.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:34.915
This one's on you.
Just call them.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.117
No!

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.722
Fine, I'll do it.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:43.657
Gimme the phone.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.461
Unbelievable.

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:52.966
(Amy's voice)
Hi, Mike, it's Amy.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.336
Schumer.
I don't talk
like that.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.338
Uh, yeah, we met on
Christmas at the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.042
Boston Market and had
sex after two beers?

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.310
Yeah.

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:04.778
You have herpes
because I have herpes.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.581
Byeee!

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.383
Did he sound like he was at
all psyched to hear from me,

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:14.054
like what was his vibe?
You're the
(bleep) worst.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.961
Wow.
Oh, no?
