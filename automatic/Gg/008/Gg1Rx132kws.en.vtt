00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.110
 hello my sweet I have it there yes 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.230
 I said that now so do what 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.910
 said on instagram in my said 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.939
 book what I planned next 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.239
 have and yes we probably already 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:40.050
 read it today is about my 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 favorite fragrance and yes that is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.470
 flank of amo and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.040
 yes I do not know I already have that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.510
 a while so very little case because 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.400
 I say the first one recently 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.920
 I've already rediscovered that 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.140
 eternal you say your man now i use 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.480
 because actually every day and is 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.400
 I just do not know it's always like that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.369
 always have a film hard to talk like 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.690
 If you want to describe the smell but me 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.180
 I do not know if you are in the top note 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.790
 base note and heart note knows about 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.009
 Anyway, it's like that pepper 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 headnote is what's in the beginning so that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.600
 to get so light that was to the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.119
 heart note what you are mainly 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 so to speak, that's the day over 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.280
 right when it lasts long and the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.060
 Basler is something that has since been 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.250
 is made up and what then, so to speak 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.100
 quasi remains and not so 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.020
 much of the village actually and does 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.090
 I have a packaging there 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.780
 thrown away 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.830
 but I picked out on the internet 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 what as a product description to the 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.900
 success stands and he can do that to you 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.540
 easy to read even notice from the head 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.270
 I look at something certainly less so 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.130
 the couple of is pure and tender 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.519
 I can not do that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:11.100
 confirm and the top notes are pure 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:13.260
 especially white flowers not at all 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.239
 light hearts or white flowers are it 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.019
 namely the peony are the rose 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.950
 and the water lilies and that's all 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:27.870
 so very gentle scents somehow the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.860
 headnote is for whatever that is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.959
 so long or no I do not know 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.489
 can not pronounce that way if you 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.870
 if you are interested in it 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.740
 you just that other stands that there 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 also and and 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.690
 the base note is then made of sandalwood 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.070
 and heliotrope does not ask me anything 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.410
 But that's definitely sandalwood 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.880
 it is almost in every case what 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.690
 I know that I do not know that's it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.630
 echt nich I do not know but I meet 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.130
 I'm not the type I know 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.840
 I do not perform then it should be so 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.450
 discreetly smell his beautiful and 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.480
 do not be pleasant so this flashy 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.190
 and evil that one then passes by and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.660
 I think oh my god, what does he have 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.910
 sprayed on it or as totally the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.560
 aggressive sweet and that is not so 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.210
 mine was also a sensitive one 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.950
 names I can not even a 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.240
 pass or headache douglas 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.280
 I got that from dad and yes 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.590
 That's why it's really very, really 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.320
 very discreet fragrance but also so 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.140
 slightly sweetish and just flowery and it 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.830
 is just beautiful, feminine and great and 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.390
 I just like it really good and me 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.370
 can you also now a few things 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.110
 I still found out that way 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.110
 I do not think so great now 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.330
 from the professional I know now synonymous 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.160
 not exactly so in any case 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.920
 somehow but definitely on the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.960
 list of peter so i believe this 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.680
 allegedly still animal experiments 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.270
 carry out 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.350
 but somehow you have many 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.930
 opinions increased and said 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.600
 somehow that only in certain 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.920
 countries because they have over 110 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.420
 countries so I think they exist 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.870
 Brand point to buy and not just in 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.780
 Germany 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.640
 and yes they have such a test 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.990
 that they assure that 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.850
 All products in Germany too 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.830
 are buying and in germany 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.000
 are made and something else on everyone 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.130
 case without animal experiments and everything done 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.900
 and i do not know i can find it 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.220
 not so good but i can not quite do it 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.110
 estimate because later more often 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.720
 yes sometimes things are exaggerating and 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.850
 I do not know if it is like that then 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.260
 finally finding out that's it 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.970
 I will not buy this anymore if 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.880
 here also what I have 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.940
 perform animal experiments but I hope 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.320
 that's just what they say 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.880
 because you can in the end still on 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:04.760
 leave one or the other opinion 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.650
 and in the moment when I'm clear 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.000
 and clearly knows that it is so keep 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.250
 I since because it is easy to find that it 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.250
 is good and I think great and then 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.890
 hope that will not be suspended 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.600
 hiking price mega and certainly if 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.250
 I am interested in the other what costs 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.320
 I think so around the 23 euro so 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.890
 at least in the Amazon I found 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.110
 because it costs 23 euros in the store I know 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.030
 not so directly where you buy it 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.620
 I could not have seen that yet 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.120
 So I have it on the internet that is 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.520
 first get nothing for free and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.560
 then I got on the internet after me 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.419
 bought yes that was it then actually 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.520
 course of the short but to my 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.169
 favorite fragrance simply because I'm in the moment 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.550
 And that's what it's all about 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.210
 Just wanted to tell something my 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.010
 favorite fragrance and just easy 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.120
 great if you find it somewhere 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.120
 then you have to just like me 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.040
 again judge can empathize with 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.630
 that can be explained so badly if 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.370
 one about performance and allowed to talk 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.630
 then that's just cool 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.710
 ok then afterwards write me and 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.510
 the comments'm what Meier 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.240
 Favorite fragrance is it would be me very much 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.710
 may be interested somehow 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.449
 someone on the scent knows who also has 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.490
 so subtle that maybe some 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.520
 others smell over and no longer on the 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.919
 or just both so what your 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.810
 favorite fragrance is and and what he does 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.030
 knows someone or a fragrance he has 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.780
 also so decent and light flowery and 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.580
 otherwise what is 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.620
 then I look at the sometimes on and 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.639
 yes I would be very happy to hear 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.889
 what euro are favorite movie and then 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:41.020
 5 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:45.150
 then I would give you one more 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.150
 nice day and see you next time
