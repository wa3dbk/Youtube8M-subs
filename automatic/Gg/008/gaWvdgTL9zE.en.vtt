so<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> computer<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.460> might<00:01:53.579> be

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so it was the computer and you might be

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.039 
so it was the computer and you might be
wondering<00:01:53.850> why<00:01:54.030> Sara<00:01:54.299> Garcia<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.750> defense

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
wondering why Sara Garcia in defense

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.990 
wondering why Sara Garcia in defense
well<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.590> dumb<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.189> did<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.460> check<00:01:56.700> who<00:01:56.850> was

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
well I was dumb I did not check who was

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
well I was dumb I did not check who was
in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> lineup<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.750> javi<00:01:57.960> Garcia<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.469> ending

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
in the lineup and javi Garcia was ending

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.130 
in the lineup and javi Garcia was ending
up<00:01:58.860> playing<00:01:59.100> left<00:01:59.430> back<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
up playing left back so you see we get a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.630 
up playing left back so you see we get a
penalty<00:02:01.409> he<00:02:01.710> goes<00:02:01.950> right<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.610> middle

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
penalty he goes right down the middle

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
penalty he goes right down the middle
unfortunately<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.659> us<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.990> don't<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
unfortunately for us we don't make the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.929 
unfortunately for us we don't make the
save<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> death<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
save and that's going to be the death of

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
save and that's going to be the death of
us<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.630> lose<00:02:06.869> four<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> three<00:02:07.469> so

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
us because we do lose four to three so

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.559 
us because we do lose four to three so
we<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.280> not<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.700> three<00:02:08.940> points<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.420> do

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
we do not get three points but we do

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.660 
we do not get three points but we do
grab<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> fair<00:02:10.379> few<00:02:10.679> bit<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.039> coins<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.569> 441

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
grab a fair few bit of coins of 441

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.430

easily<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.420> division<00:02:20.200> 4<00:02:20.380> has<00:02:20.560> been<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.890> lot

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
easily and division 4 has been a lot

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.949 
easily and division 4 has been a lot
tougher<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.670> our<00:02:22.000> second<00:02:22.270> game<00:02:22.360> hip<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:22.900> we

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
tougher in our second game hip so now we

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.400 
tougher in our second game hip so now we
come<00:02:23.170> up<00:02:23.290> against<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.840> not<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.080> good

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
come up against I not really a good

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.250 
come up against I not really a good
squad<00:02:26.830> i<00:02:26.890> should<00:02:27.220> say<00:02:27.370> 98<00:02:27.790> chemistry<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.510> lot<00:02:29.140> of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
squad i should say 98 chemistry a lot of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.080 
squad i should say 98 chemistry a lot of
players<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.800> nine<00:02:30.310> chem<00:02:30.580> which<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.910> always

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
players not on nine chem which is always

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.729 
players not on nine chem which is always
also<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.540> defense<00:02:31.810> was<00:02:31.959> fine<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
also the defense was fine but the

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.170 
also the defense was fine but the
midfield<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> strikers<00:02:33.760> were<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> bit

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
midfield and the strikers were a bit

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.360 
midfield and the strikers were a bit
sketchy<00:02:34.450> because<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.260> weren't<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:35.709> perfect

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
sketchy because they weren't on perfect

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.759 
sketchy because they weren't on perfect
chemistry<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:37.270> hey<00:02:37.450> I'll<00:02:38.020> take<00:02:38.260> advantage<00:02:38.680> of

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
chemistry but hey I'll take advantage of

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.220 
chemistry but hey I'll take advantage of
that<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.750> considering<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.840> guy<00:02:40.959> did<00:02:41.110> not

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
that so considering this guy did not

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.809 
that so considering this guy did not
have<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.440> best<00:02:41.620> team<00:02:41.860> he<00:02:42.280> made<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.459> mistake

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
have the best team he made a mistake

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.190 
have the best team he made a mistake
with<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> goalkeeper<00:02:43.540> early<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> bad

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
with the goalkeeper early on with a bad

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.229 
with the goalkeeper early on with a bad
throw<00:02:44.470> out<00:02:44.709> get<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.250> ball<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.760> believe<00:02:46.090> that

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
throw out get the ball to I believe that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.970
