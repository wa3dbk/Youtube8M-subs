it's<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> thought<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> most

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it's just that I thought the most

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.490 
it's just that I thought the most
compelling<00:02:06.299> part<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.720> her<00:02:06.810> story<00:02:07.110> had<00:02:07.350> already

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.789 
compelling part of her story had already
been<00:02:07.799> told<00:02:08.040> but<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:08.850> was<00:02:09.119> wrong<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:10.320> arrived<00:02:10.590> at

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799
