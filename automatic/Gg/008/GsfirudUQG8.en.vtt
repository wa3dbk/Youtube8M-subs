00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
seven let's take a look at it all right

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.320 
seven let's take a look at it all right
there's<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.339> first<00:00:39.699> look<00:00:40.000> at<00:00:40.239> it<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.040> a

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
there's a first look at it this is a

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.970 
there's a first look at it this is a
overall<00:00:43.330> length<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.750> this<00:00:43.870> thing<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.230> right<00:00:44.769> at

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
overall length of this thing is right at

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.020 
overall length of this thing is right at
8<00:00:45.250> inches<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.980> they're<00:00:51.190> 8<00:00:51.460> inches<00:00:51.820> and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
8 inches and see they're 8 inches and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.670 
8 inches and see they're 8 inches and
the<00:00:52.120> blade<00:00:52.420> length<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:53.160> looks<00:00:54.160> like<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.489> sharp

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the blade length is looks like the sharp

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.590 
the blade length is looks like the sharp
surface<00:00:56.680> or<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.699> sharp<00:00:58.120> edge<00:00:58.329> of<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.539> blade

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
surface or the sharp edge of the blade

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.279 
surface or the sharp edge of the blade
is<00:00:58.989> three<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.410> quarter<00:00:59.680> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.930> closed

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
is three and a quarter and the closed

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.920 
is three and a quarter and the closed
the<00:01:03.250> closed<00:01:03.550> length<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:04.000> this<00:01:04.089> thing<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.539> about

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
the closed length of this thing is about

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.760 
the closed length of this thing is about
five<00:01:05.470> inches<00:01:05.950> I<00:01:06.100> believe<00:01:07.050> yeah<00:01:08.050> it's<00:01:08.380> five

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
five inches I believe yeah it's five

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.890 
five inches I believe yeah it's five
inches<00:01:09.070> closed

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.910 

so<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:15.620> thing<00:01:15.830> has<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:17.710> three-quarter<00:01:18.710> inch

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
so this thing has a three-quarter inch

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.050 
so this thing has a three-quarter inch
Teflon<00:01:19.730> coated<00:01:21.130> partial<00:01:22.130> hollow<00:01:22.550> ground

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
Teflon coated partial hollow ground

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.090 
Teflon coated partial hollow ground
blade<00:01:24.430> which<00:01:25.430> should<00:01:26.300> be<00:01:26.450> pretty<00:01:26.630> sharp

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
blade which should be pretty sharp

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.410 
blade which should be pretty sharp
whenever<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.190> get<00:01:28.310> a<00:01:28.370> blade<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.670> was<00:01:28.940> run<00:01:29.270> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
whenever I get a blade I was run it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.320 
whenever I get a blade I was run it
through<00:01:29.690> one<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.320> these<00:01:30.410> little<00:01:30.710> ceramic

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
through one of these little ceramic

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.760 
through one of these little ceramic
blade<00:01:32.330> sharpens<00:01:32.900> just<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.260> take<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.530> burrs

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
blade sharpens just to take the burrs

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.090 
blade sharpens just to take the burrs
off<00:01:34.130> not<00:01:34.730> really<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.090> sharpen<00:01:35.480> it<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:36.100> to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
off not really to sharpen it just to to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.040 
off not really to sharpen it just to to
feel<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.760> see<00:01:38.090> there's<00:01:38.240> any<00:01:38.390> burrs<00:01:38.660> on<00:01:38.900> this

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
feel it see there's any burrs on this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.240 
feel it see there's any burrs on this
thing<00:01:39.260> feels<00:01:39.470> really<00:01:39.830> sharp<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:43.010> I'm<00:01:43.100> going<00:01:43.220> to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
thing feels really sharp so I'm going to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.110 
thing feels really sharp so I'm going to
do<00:01:43.370> a<00:01:43.400> cut<00:01:43.670> test<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.960> minute<00:01:46.120> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
got instead of thumb studs it has these

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.320 
got instead of thumb studs it has these
things<00:02:19.730> called

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
things called

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.600 
things called
well<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.810> guess<00:02:21.170> they're<00:02:21.380> your<00:02:21.770> like<00:02:21.950> thumb

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
well I guess they're your like thumb

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.150 
well I guess they're your like thumb
lozenges<00:02:23.360> they're<00:02:23.600> really<00:02:23.840> big<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.470> think

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
lozenges they're really big I think

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.560 
lozenges they're really big I think
that's<00:02:25.310> one<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> mistakes<00:02:25.970> they<00:02:26.150> made<00:02:26.360> in

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
that's one of the mistakes they made in

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.040 
that's one of the mistakes they made in
this<00:02:26.810> design<00:02:28.150> they're<00:02:29.150> almost<00:02:29.330> too<00:02:29.720> big<00:02:29.900> to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
this design they're almost too big to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.290 
this design they're almost too big to
get<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> hold<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.920> right<00:02:31.489> too<00:02:31.700> close<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
get a hold of a right too close to the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.350 
get a hold of a right too close to the
scales<00:02:32.980> but<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.040> did<00:02:34.310> put<00:02:34.550> some<00:02:34.580> three<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.150> one

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
scales but I did put some three in one

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.470 
scales but I did put some three in one
oil<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.470> pivot<00:02:36.890> screw<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.270> thing

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
oil on the pivot screw so this thing

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.820 
oil on the pivot screw so this thing
comes<00:02:38.930> out<00:02:39.050> pretty<00:02:39.230> easy

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
comes out pretty easy

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.140 
comes out pretty easy
it's<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.640> fast<00:02:41.000> opener<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:41.840> it's<00:02:41.989> not<00:02:42.140> bad

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it's not a fast opener but it's not bad

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.410 
it's not a fast opener but it's not bad
