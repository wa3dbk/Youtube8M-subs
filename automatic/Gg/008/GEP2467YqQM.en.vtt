my boss idea is the king of Atlantis and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.720

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
but it's hot or it's easier so if
something<00:02:08.909> takes<00:02:09.450> away<00:02:09.720> your<00:02:09.750> perks<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.349> makes

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
something takes away your perks or makes

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.240 
something takes away your perks or makes
the<00:02:11.250> map<00:02:11.459> harder<00:02:12.030> than<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.239> should<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.750> or

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
the map harder than it should be or

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.619 
the map harder than it should be or
harder<00:02:14.250> than<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.580> guys<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.060> want<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
harder than you guys really want it to

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.920 
harder than you guys really want it to
be<00:02:15.810> then<00:02:16.470> that'd<00:02:16.709> be<00:02:16.920> kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.549> that<00:02:18.540> make<00:02:18.780> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
be then that'd be kind of that make it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
be then that'd be kind of that make it
what<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.829> call<00:02:19.980> nerfed<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.670> something<00:02:20.999> like

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
what is it call nerfed or something like

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.699 
what is it call nerfed or something like
that<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:22.139> it<00:02:22.290> wouldn't<00:02:22.469> make<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that but it wouldn't make it to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.300 
that but it wouldn't make it to
overpower

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
overpower

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.330 
overpower
or<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.730> that's<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.420> little<00:02:24.780> thing<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.380> king<00:02:26.099> of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
or so that's my little thing the king of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.930 
or so that's my little thing the king of
Atlantis<00:02:26.910> running<00:02:27.599> at<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.930> Brutus<00:02:28.290> or

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
Atlantis running at you like Brutus or

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.630 
Atlantis running at you like Brutus or
not<00:02:29.940> running<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.569> slowly<00:02:30.989> like<00:02:31.290> George<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:32.040> mix

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
not running but slowly like George a mix

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.420 
not running but slowly like George a mix
between<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.270> bosses<00:02:33.690> we've<00:02:33.870> seen<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.319> far<00:02:34.430> so

between the bosses we've seen so far so

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
between the bosses we've seen so far so
that's<00:02:35.700> my<00:02:35.880> boss<00:02:36.060> if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> guys<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> better

boss leave it in the comment section

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.979 
boss leave it in the comment section
below<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.640> map<00:02:41.819> now<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.780> picture

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
below so the map now I have this picture

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.500 
below so the map now I have this picture
and<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.709> what<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.890> imagined<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.880> it's<00:02:45.150> just

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and this is what I imagined so it's just

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.570 
and this is what I imagined so it's just
a<00:02:45.720> kingdom<00:02:46.380> or<00:02:46.709> something<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.130> on<00:02:47.310> an

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
a kingdom or something like that on an

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.479 
a kingdom or something like that on an
island<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:49.050> Easter<00:02:49.560> egg<00:02:49.680> now<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.310> my

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
island and the Easter egg now this is my

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.850 
island and the Easter egg now this is my
idea<00:02:50.519> for<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.150> Easter<00:02:51.540> egg<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.319> activate

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
idea for the Easter egg you activate

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.559 
idea for the Easter egg you activate
something<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.670> something<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.300> all<00:02:54.450> these

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
something do something to do all these

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.720 
something do something to do all these
steps<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.319> Easter<00:02:55.739> egg<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.100> you're

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
steps for the Easter egg and you're

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.809 
steps for the Easter egg and you're
actually<00:02:56.940> able<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.989> sync<00:02:58.560> Atlantis<00:02:59.459> make<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
actually able to sync Atlantis make it

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.390 
actually able to sync Atlantis make it
go<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> bottom<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:01.019> there's<00:03:01.860> something

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
go to the bottom but there's something

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.600 
go to the bottom but there's something
there<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.420> makes<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.440> biodome<00:03:05.040> around<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
there that makes a biodome around it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.600 
there that makes a biodome around it
something<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.120> where<00:03:06.480> you're<00:03:06.660> able<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
something like that where you're able to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.449 
something like that where you're able to
go<00:03:08.610> through<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.049> map<00:03:10.260> still<00:03:11.010> when<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> goes

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
go through the map still when it goes

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.800 
go through the map still when it goes
underwater<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.150> doesn't<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.450> end<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
underwater so it doesn't just end the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.580 
underwater so it doesn't just end the
game<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:14.450> it'd<00:03:15.450> be<00:03:15.480> pretty<00:03:15.690> cool<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:15.959> some

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
game and it'd be pretty cool if some

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.839 
game and it'd be pretty cool if some
rooms<00:03:17.099> were<00:03:18.620> filled<00:03:19.620> with<00:03:19.709> water<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.370> can

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
rooms were filled with water so you can

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:21.979 
rooms were filled with water so you can
make<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.000> buildable<00:03:21.510> where<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.690> could<00:03:21.810> breathe

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
make a buildable where you could breathe

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.900 
make a buildable where you could breathe
underwater<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.590> something<00:03:22.860> like<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.010> having

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
underwater or something like that having

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.640 
underwater or something like that having
a<00:03:24.150> couple<00:03:24.420> minutes<00:03:24.690> underwater<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:25.530> it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
a couple minutes underwater and then it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.900 
a couple minutes underwater and then it
breaks<00:03:25.830> or<00:03:26.099> something<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.519> that'd<00:03:26.790> be

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
breaks or something like that that'd be

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.780 
breaks or something like that that'd be
awesome<00:03:27.769> but<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.859> could<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.160> picture<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
awesome but I could just picture a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.300 
awesome but I could just picture a
biodome<00:03:30.660> over<00:03:31.079> at<00:03:31.230> lance's<00:03:31.620> after<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.010> has

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
biodome over at lance's after it has

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.400 
biodome over at lance's after it has
fallen<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:33.000> something<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.720> my<00:03:34.170> last

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
fallen or something like that in my last

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.710 
fallen or something like that in my last
picture<00:03:34.829> or<00:03:35.190> actually<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.150> picture<00:03:36.630> on

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
picture or actually on the picture on

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.890 
picture or actually on the picture on
screen<00:03:37.700> maybe<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:39.000> blue<00:03:39.239> light<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.480> comes

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
screen maybe that blue light that comes

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.960 
screen maybe that blue light that comes
up<00:03:40.170> we'll<00:03:40.410> cover<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.980> whole<00:03:41.220> lantus<00:03:41.730> but

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
up we'll cover the whole lantus but

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.340 
up we'll cover the whole lantus but
that'd<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.180> pretty<00:03:42.299> cool<00:03:42.420> tell<00:03:43.079> me<00:03:43.170> what<00:03:43.260> you
