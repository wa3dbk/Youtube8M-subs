00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 To celebrate every new year of observation 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 NASA / ESA takes Hubble telescope a new beautiful sky shot. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 This year it was 24th birthday 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Space Telescope published a snapshot of NGC 2174. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 This Nebula, also known as the Monkey Head, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 it is full of young stars shrouded in vibrant clouds of cosmic gas and dust. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Episode 73: Hubble returns to Monkey Head to celebrate his 24th birthday 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Nebulae are popular targets of the Hubble Telescope. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Colorful gas sidings and brilliant bright stars create beautifully beautiful images. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Many of the most beautiful and popular Hubble images are nebulae. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Take, for example, the remarkable snapshot of The Ring Nebula published last year 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 or this beautifully fine image of the Horsehead Nebula 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 published on the 23rd Anniversary of Hubble. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 In 2012, Hubble watched the Tarantula Nebula to celebrate its 22nd birthday 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 and for the 21st birthday he photographed the amazing cosmic rose Arp 273. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Now, to celebrate 24 years in orbit, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Hubble visited again part of NGC 2174 Nebula 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 better known as the Monkey Head. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Dark brown and rusty clouds of dust are billowing 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 on a light blue gas background. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 These extraordinary shades were created by combining several Hubble images 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 taken through different color filters - reveal a wide range of colors that are normally invisible to the human eye. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 It's not the first time the Hubble Telescope has focused on Monkey Head, 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 located 6400 light-years away in the constellation Orion. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 NGC 2174 was observed by the telescope as early as 2011. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 In this powerful stellar nursery, we find all the raw materials needed to produce stars. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 But the recipe for baking new stars is not very effective 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 and most of the ingredients are wasted by 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 that the cloud of gas and dust gradually melts. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 The pace of decay of this nebula is accelerated by the hot young stars, 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 that emit a fast stellar wind that blows the gas clouds. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Since its launch in 1990 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Hubble Space Telescope watched a plethora of cosmic treasures. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Captures natural beauty 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 it represents a unique window to the universe and year after year it continues to amaze us 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 beautiful images and cutting-edge science. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Happy Birthday to Hubble's 24th Birthday! 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
