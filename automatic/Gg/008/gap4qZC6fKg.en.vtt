once on this off right through here

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.730 
once on this off right through here
didn't<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.700> through<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> oil<00:01:42.119> tank

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
didn't get through the oil tank

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.450 
didn't get through the oil tank
fortunately<00:01:45.500> try<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> document<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.340> as

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
fortunately try to document this one as

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.690 
fortunately try to document this one as
it<00:01:47.579> go

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.810 

and<00:01:53.180> as<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.540> thought<00:01:54.040> this<00:01:55.040> base<00:01:55.400> wasn't

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
and as I thought this base wasn't

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.350 
and as I thought this base wasn't
sealing<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:57.080> all<00:01:57.380> wet<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:58.580> can<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.180> was

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
sealing it's all wet you can and it was

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.670 
sealing it's all wet you can and it was
not<00:01:59.570> sticking<00:02:00.110> at<00:02:00.229> all

I mean Sue's the boats were we're loose

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.389 
I mean Sue's the boats were we're loose
this<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:03.020> bouncing<00:02:03.740> around<00:02:03.799> there<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.220> no

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
this was bouncing around there and no

it's<00:02:06.740> actually<00:02:07.130> been<00:02:07.310> chafing<00:02:07.880> it's<00:02:08.569> been

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
one actually goes through the front and

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.340 

I<00:03:16.790> already<00:03:17.790> measured<00:03:18.030> my<00:03:18.390> squish<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.080> had<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
I already measured my squish I had the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.890 
I already measured my squish I had the

sure<00:03:22.200> I'd<00:03:22.350> be<00:03:22.380> okay<00:03:22.830> I'm<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.130> put<00:03:23.280> this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
sure I'd be okay I'm going to put this

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.120 
sure I'd be okay I'm going to put this
one<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.670> gasket<00:03:24.360> list<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:25.560> unless<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.010> know

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
one on gasket list but unless you know

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.980 
one on gasket list but unless you know
how<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.310> check<00:03:26.640> your<00:03:26.700> squish<00:03:27.209> which<00:03:27.540> basically

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
how to check your squish which basically

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.260 
how to check your squish which basically
means<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.680> your<00:03:29.400> piston<00:03:29.790> isn't<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.209> to

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
means that your piston isn't going to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.640 
means that your piston isn't going to
run<00:03:30.420> into<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.810> top<00:03:31.020> of<00:03:31.050> your<00:03:31.290> combustion

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
run into the top of your combustion

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.230 
run into the top of your combustion
chamber<00:03:32.190> I'd<00:03:32.640> recommend<00:03:33.270> using<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.720> gaskets

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
chamber I'd recommend using the gaskets

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.740
