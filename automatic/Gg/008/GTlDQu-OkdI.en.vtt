from your country it has an eat better
chance<00:06:03.820> of<00:06:03.970> being<00:06:04.120> shiny<00:06:04.510> it<00:06:04.780> makes<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.110> go

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
chance of being shiny it makes it go

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.180 
chance of being shiny it makes it go
from<00:06:05.380> like<00:06:05.560> 1<00:06:05.950> in<00:06:06.070> 8,000<00:06:06.850> to<00:06:06.910> like<00:06:07.090> one<00:06:07.450> and

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
from like 1 in 8,000 to like one and

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.400 
from like 1 in 8,000 to like one and
like<00:06:09.270> 2000<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:10.330> think<00:06:10.360> or<00:06:10.720> something<00:06:10.750> like<00:06:11.200> that

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
like 2000 I think or something like that

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.409 
like 2000 I think or something like that
and<00:06:11.650> I<00:06:12.370> think<00:06:12.430> that'd<00:06:12.790> be<00:06:12.820> pretty<00:06:12.940> sweet

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
and I think that'd be pretty sweet

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.830 
and I think that'd be pretty sweet
just<00:06:13.870> having<00:06:14.740> shiny<00:06:15.070> eggs<00:06:15.400> maybe<00:06:16.150> sweet<00:06:16.479> and

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
just having shiny eggs maybe sweet and

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.960 
just having shiny eggs maybe sweet and
now<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.169> second<00:06:17.620> object<00:06:17.770> is<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.280> shiny<00:06:18.580> charm

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
now the second object is the shiny charm

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.340 
now the second object is the shiny charm
and<00:06:19.180> now<00:06:19.240> to<00:06:19.300> obtain<00:06:19.630> this<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.080> have<00:06:20.200> to

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
and now to obtain this you have to

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.110 
and now to obtain this you have to
capture<00:06:20.710> all<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:21.010> Pokemon<00:06:21.460> in<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.700> national
