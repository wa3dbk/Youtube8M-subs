in my opinion are very it's very like

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.429 
in my opinion are very it's very like
one<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> those<00:01:02.969> things<00:01:03.030> where<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.780> works<00:01:04.260> for

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
one of those things where it works for

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
one of those things where it works for
someone<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.979> someone<00:01:05.129> may<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> someone

more<00:01:09.060> different<00:01:09.510> than<00:01:09.540> skin<00:01:10.049> types<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.380> my

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

splash is like the brush is flexible
with<00:02:58.920> people<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.520> hated<00:02:59.880> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
with people so that they hated it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.340 
with people so that they hated it
because<00:03:00.120> there's<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.300> little<00:03:00.450> thing<00:03:01.230> right

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
because there's a little thing right

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.720 
because there's a little thing right
there<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.680> makes<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> blush<00:03:02.070> able<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> move

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
there that makes the blush able to move

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.730 
there that makes the blush able to move
I<00:03:03.090> actually<00:03:03.570> like<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.170> cuz<00:03:04.380> there's<00:03:04.530> some

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
I actually like it cuz there's some

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.190 
I actually like it cuz there's some
parts<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.490> lashes<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.970> angle<00:03:06.450> out<00:03:06.660> more

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
parts of my lashes that angle out more

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.740 
parts of my lashes that angle out more
than<00:03:07.380> others<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:08.460> it's<00:03:09.030> easier<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.540> apply

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
than others and it's easier to apply

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.680 
than others and it's easier to apply
them<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.140> area

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.850

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.460 
the brush is shaped I like how it's
skinnier<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.480> engines<00:03:26.930> because<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.320> makes

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
skinnier in the engines because it makes

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.930 
skinnier in the engines because it makes
it<00:03:27.560> easier<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.280> inner<00:03:28.430> corner<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.820> my
