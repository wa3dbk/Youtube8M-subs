00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.430
 fasting and walking is actually one 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.380
 ideal combination is so that the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.880
 people who come to these courses yes 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.780
 always very everyday burdened 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.760
 are stressed 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.300
 by having three to four hours 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.040
 walking in the nature in the day and the clock 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.690
 one absorbs nature automatically 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.460
 It's always quieter for me 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.460
 fascinating to watch 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.489
 and you slowly find yourself too 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.489
 even 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.620
 he think of fasting is Lugner has 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 said fasting should never be an end in itself 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.020
 has to fast always be a way for the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.729
 each individually where different leads 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.700
 but you should set yourself a goal and 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.369
 after that, of course , his often 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 bad everyday habits 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.700
 to change 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.910
 lighter 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.330
 b 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.230
 m 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.140
 So I have morning exercises on 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.200
 Best fallen in the meadow in 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.740
 the morning in the morning sun and this 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.740
 send 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.060
 do 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.030
 not only the weight that me 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.780
 I lost my joints 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.840
 has become more mobile 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.130
 Of course, a lot from this 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.690
 hikes take place every day 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.110
 this gymnastics in tomorrow 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.570
 that takes the circulation in 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.280
 swing and make everything easy so I 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.280
 become feel 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.300
 the 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.150
 So it's almost just a group that makes 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.860
 Just more fun you can 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.390
 others prove it 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.200
 exactly the same so why one by trailer 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.480
 would have 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.950
 the legs hurt then pulls then 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.240
 through together again and makes the 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.240
 hike and that's just great 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.400
 So I'm really excited about it 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.669
 what happened to her like that 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.590
 was organized and yes so the 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.270
 lectures can really recommend now never 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.270
