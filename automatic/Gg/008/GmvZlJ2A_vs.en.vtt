00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
then we're going to stop and the second
time<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.030> play<00:02:29.209> through<00:02:29.510> focus<00:02:30.319> on<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
time to play through focus on the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.479 
time to play through focus on the
strumming<00:02:30.920> pattern

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
strumming pattern

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.280 
strumming pattern
I'll<00:02:31.730> liven<00:02:32.150> up<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.360> strumming<00:02:32.690> pattern<00:02:32.720> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
I'll liven up the strumming pattern so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.600 
I'll liven up the strumming pattern so
that<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.530> fits<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.920> tune<00:02:34.099> a<00:02:34.250> little<00:02:34.340> better

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that it fits the tune a little better

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.970 
that it fits the tune a little better
the<00:02:35.599> third<00:02:35.780> time<00:02:35.959> through<00:02:36.200> I'm<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.860> talk

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the third time through I'm going to talk

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.680 
the third time through I'm going to talk
about<00:02:37.099> texturing<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.700> tune<00:02:37.970> which<00:02:38.299> is<00:02:38.480> a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
about texturing the tune which is a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.080 
about texturing the tune which is a
major<00:02:39.170> goal<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.620> my<00:02:39.769> tutorial<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.430> want<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.970> be

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
major goal of my tutorial I want to be

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
major goal of my tutorial I want to be
able<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.269> show<00:02:41.480> different<00:02:41.930> structures<00:02:42.349> so

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
able to show different structures so

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.009 
able to show different structures so
that<00:02:43.040> you're<00:02:43.280> able<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.630> give<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.840> tune

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
that you're able to give the tune

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.630 
that you're able to give the tune
dimension<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.680> actually<00:02:46.040> play<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
dimension and actually play with the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.130 
dimension and actually play with the
tune<00:02:46.819> itself<00:02:47.150> which<00:02:47.450> i<00:02:47.599> think<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> very

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
tune itself which i think is a very

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.289 
tune itself which i think is a very
important<00:02:48.709> part<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.430> being<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.849> company<00:02:50.150> is

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
important part of being in a company is

00:02:50.299 --> 00:03:41.520 
important part of being in a company is
to<00:02:50.480> say<00:02:51.290> here<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.560> go

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.810 

this<00:03:42.530> time<00:03:42.770> instead<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:43.280> doing<00:03:43.670> basic

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
this time instead of just doing basic

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.520 
this time instead of just doing basic
boom<00:03:44.240> chucks<00:03:44.570> which<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.050> what<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.410> was

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
boom chucks which is what that was

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.650 
boom chucks which is what that was
called<00:03:45.590> I'm<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.790> try<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.000> listen<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.540> the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
called I'm going to try to listen to the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:04:28.750 
called I'm going to try to listen to the
tune<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:48.290> play<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.650> little<00:03:48.890> bit<00:03:49.130> more<00:03:49.250> vividly

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.980 

and<00:04:29.760> now<00:04:30.000> I'm<00:04:30.060> gonna<00:04:30.210> talk<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.510> little<00:04:30.780> bit

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
and now I'm gonna talk a little bit

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.450 
and now I'm gonna talk a little bit
about<00:04:31.020> texturing<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.890> tune<00:04:32.070> which<00:04:32.280> is

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
about texturing the tune which is

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.400 
about texturing the tune which is
something<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.450> wouldn't<00:04:33.660> necessarily<00:04:34.110> do<00:04:34.320> in

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
something you wouldn't necessarily do in

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.630 
something you wouldn't necessarily do in
a<00:04:34.500> session<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.250> you're<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.490> playing

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
a session but if you're just playing

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.640 
a session but if you're just playing
one-on-one<00:04:36.270> with<00:04:36.450> somebody<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.170> nice<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.560> be

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
one-on-one with somebody it's nice to be

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.320 
one-on-one with somebody it's nice to be
able<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.830> listen<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.430> tune<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.940> give<00:04:39.210> it

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
able to listen to the tune and give it

00:04:39.330 --> 00:05:23.110 
able to listen to the tune and give it
what<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.570> needs<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.990> sound<00:04:40.170> more<00:04:40.710> dimensional

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.760 

one<00:05:24.120> last<00:05:24.300> thing<00:05:24.570> that's<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.440> really<00:05:25.650> nice

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
one last thing that's a really nice

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.500 
one last thing that's a really nice
trick<00:05:26.160> and<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.610> don't<00:05:26.790> want<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:26.940> overuse<00:05:27.300> it

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
trick and you don't want to overuse it

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.970 
trick and you don't want to overuse it
but<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:27.900> being<00:05:28.050> able<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.350> texture<00:05:28.830> by

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
but it's being able to texture by

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.370 
but it's being able to texture by
throwing<00:05:29.280> in<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.730> minor<00:05:29.970> chord<00:05:30.240> in<00:05:30.960> this<00:05:31.200> case

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
throwing in a minor chord in this case

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.080 
throwing in a minor chord in this case
since<00:05:31.590> we're<00:05:31.710> in<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:31.860> key<00:05:32.010> of<00:05:32.040> D<00:05:32.280> our<00:05:32.820> minor

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
since we're in the key of D our minor

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.600 
since we're in the key of D our minor
relative<00:05:33.540> is<00:05:33.630> going<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.840> be<00:05:33.930> a<00:05:33.960> B<00:05:34.170> minor<00:05:34.610> to

and<00:06:09.710> you<00:06:10.130> can<00:06:10.280> throw<00:06:10.490> it<00:06:10.640> in<00:06:10.790> instead<00:06:11.660> of<00:06:11.720> a<00:06:11.900> D

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
and you can throw it in instead of a D

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.950 
and you can throw it in instead of a D
sometimes<00:06:13.610> so<00:06:14.270> I'll<00:06:14.540> show<00:06:14.720> you
