00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
clip to the one I showed you but still

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.090 
clip to the one I showed you but still
the<00:01:37.530> same<00:01:37.740> principle<00:01:39.259> go<00:01:40.259> ahead<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> drag<00:01:40.890> our

the same principle go ahead and drag our

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
the same principle go ahead and drag our
clip<00:01:41.340> into<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> terminal<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:45.210> saw<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
clip into the terminal we saw just a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.160 
clip into the terminal we saw just a
little<00:01:45.990> bit

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.660 

okay<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.909> what<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.210> want<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.450> do<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:54.460> this

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
okay and what you want to do is see this

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.660 
okay and what you want to do is see this
film<00:01:55.000> reel<00:01:55.360> clip<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.680> frame<00:01:56.979> blending<00:01:57.220> button

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
film reel clip the frame blending button

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.020 
film reel clip the frame blending button
here<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:59.259> one<00:01:59.470> harder<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.640> want<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.850> make

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
here this one harder you want to make

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.929 
here this one harder you want to make
sure<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.540> that's<00:02:01.689> clicked<00:02:02.140> because<00:02:03.070> that's

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
sure that that's clicked because that's

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.760 
sure that that's clicked because that's
gone<00:02:04.240> -<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.479> key<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.720> getting<00:02:05.140> smooth<00:02:05.500> slow

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
gone - the key to getting smooth slow

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
gone - the key to getting smooth slow
motion<00:02:06.159> because<00:02:06.280> what<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.180> will<00:02:07.210> do<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.659> will

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
motion because what it will do it will

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.870 
motion because what it will do it will
blend<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.300> frames<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:11.080> between<00:02:11.550> frames<00:02:12.550> if

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
blend the frames in between frames if

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.559 
blend the frames in between frames if
you<00:02:13.000> know<00:02:13.120> what<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.239> mean

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you know what I mean

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.130 
you know what I mean
so<00:02:13.989> create<00:02:14.730> super<00:02:15.730> smooth<00:02:16.060> slow<00:02:16.450> motion<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
so create super smooth slow motion and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.589 
so create super smooth slow motion and
then<00:02:17.950> once<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.370> button<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:18.910> clicked<00:02:19.209> you

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
then once that button is clicked you

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.979 
then once that button is clicked you
want<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> go<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.959> layer<00:02:21.030> frame<00:02:22.030> blending<00:02:22.300> and

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
want to go to layer frame blending and

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.870 
want to go to layer frame blending and
turn<00:02:23.590> pixel<00:02:24.100> motion<00:02:24.489> on<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.519> see<00:02:27.700> now

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
turn pixel motion on so you can see now

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.289 
turn pixel motion on so you can see now
I've<00:02:28.000> got<00:02:28.180> pixel<00:02:28.600> motion<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.940> but

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
I've got pixel motion on and that but

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.809 
I've got pixel motion on and that but
unclick<00:02:31.720> -<00:02:31.959> there<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:33.190> what<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.459> want<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.610> do

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
unclick - there then what you want to do

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.479 
unclick - there then what you want to do
is<00:02:34.230> trickster<00:02:35.370> 4.5<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:38.100> you'll<00:02:39.100> get<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.280> bunch

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
is trickster 4.5 and you'll get a bunch

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.660 
is trickster 4.5 and you'll get a bunch
of<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.680> controls<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.010> settings<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.640> a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
of of controls and settings here a

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.820 
of of controls and settings here a
majority<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.959> can<00:02:44.140> play<00:02:44.319> around<00:02:44.410> we've

clicked a lot I think 30 frames per
second<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:26.049> do<00:03:26.440> need<00:03:26.709> 60<00:03:27.190> frames<00:03:27.459> per

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
second and you do need 60 frames per

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.580 
second and you do need 60 frames per
second<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.840> sort<00:03:29.049> of<00:03:29.170> slow<00:03:29.380> motion

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
second to do this sort of slow motion

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.809 
second to do this sort of slow motion
stuff<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:31.750> what<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.049> want<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.819> we

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
stuff and then what you want to do is we

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.220 
stuff and then what you want to do is we
drop<00:03:34.060> down<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.540> go<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.470> effects<00:03:36.299> tweaks<00:03:37.299> 24.5

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
drop down this go to effects tweaks 24.5

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.180 
drop down this go to effects tweaks 24.5
and<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:39.670> output<00:03:40.030> control<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.140> then<00:03:42.100> we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
and then output control and then we're

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.949 
and then output control and then we're
going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.340> set<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.579> keyframe<00:03:42.840> click<00:03:43.840> this

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
going to set a keyframe click this

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.819 
going to set a keyframe click this
stopwatch<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.760> speed<00:03:46.090> 100<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.530> then<00:03:47.650> we'll

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
stopwatch for speed 100 and then we'll

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.860 
stopwatch for speed 100 and then we'll
move<00:03:47.980> forward<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.459> few<00:03:48.639> frames<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.920> where<00:03:51.870> we

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
move forward a few frames to where we

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.100 
move forward a few frames to where we
want<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.200> slow<00:03:53.410> motion<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.980> start

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.660 

so<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> slow<00:03:58.620> motion<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.160> start<00:03:59.400> about

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
so on the slow motion to start about

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.530 
so on the slow motion to start about
here<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:01.320> I'll<00:04:01.440> add<00:04:01.590> another<00:04:01.950> keyframe<00:04:02.540> we'll

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
here so I'll add another keyframe we'll

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.000 
here so I'll add another keyframe we'll
move<00:04:03.750> forward<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.440> few<00:04:05.070> frames<00:04:06.710> about<00:04:07.710> there

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
move forward a few frames about there

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.760 
move forward a few frames about there
yeah<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.630> then<00:04:09.630> we'll<00:04:09.810> drop<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.230> speed<00:04:10.500> down

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
yeah and then we'll drop the speed down

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.450 
yeah and then we'll drop the speed down
to<00:04:11.010> about<00:04:11.960> we<00:04:12.960> say<00:04:13.140> through<00:04:13.440> ya<00:04:13.950> threes<00:04:14.310> all

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
to about we say through ya threes all

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.920 
to about we say through ya threes all
right<00:04:14.610> click<00:04:15.240> enter<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:18.180> then<00:04:18.390> we'll<00:04:18.750> move

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
right click enter and then we'll move

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.960 
right click enter and then we'll move
forward<00:04:19.200> some<00:04:20.040> frames<00:04:23.450> will<00:04:24.450> go<00:04:25.670> right<00:04:26.670> there

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
forward some frames will go right there

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.920 
forward some frames will go right there
yeah<00:04:27.200> then<00:04:28.200> add<00:04:28.440> another<00:04:28.560> keyframe<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.930> from

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
yeah then add another keyframe so from

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.000 
yeah then add another keyframe so from
this<00:04:31.080> keyframe<00:04:32.090> so<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.270> K<00:04:33.540> frame<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.740> all

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
this keyframe so that K frame is all

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.640 
this keyframe so that K frame is all
slow<00:04:35.580> motion<00:04:36.170> there<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:38.460> then<00:04:38.580> we'll<00:04:38.790> move

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
slow motion there and then we'll move

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.250 
slow motion there and then we'll move
forward<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:41.010> couple<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.460> more<00:04:41.640> frames<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:46.110> then

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
forward a couple of more frames and then

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.880 
forward a couple of more frames and then
make<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:48.410> 100<00:04:49.410> back<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.010> normal<00:04:50.400> speed<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:51.890> it

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
make it 100 back to normal speed so it

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.350 
make it 100 back to normal speed so it
goes<00:04:54.170> normal<00:04:55.170> speed<00:04:55.440> normal<00:04:55.470> fade<00:04:56.360> slow

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
goes normal speed normal fade slow

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.770 
goes normal speed normal fade slow
motion<00:04:57.870> slow<00:04:58.020> motion<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:59.730> then<00:05:00.420> back<00:05:00.600> up<00:05:00.630> to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
motion slow motion and then back up to

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.360 
motion slow motion and then back up to
normal<00:05:01.110> speed<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:04.650> can<00:05:04.830> see<00:05:05.070> here

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
normal speed and you can see here

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.330 
normal speed and you can see here
because<00:05:05.580> we've<00:05:05.940> stretched<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.360> clip<00:05:06.570> at<00:05:07.340> the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
because we've stretched the clip at the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.600 
because we've stretched the clip at the
ends<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.820> bit<00:05:08.850> earlier<00:05:09.390> than<00:05:10.280> than<00:05:11.280> what<00:05:11.490> we

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
ends a bit earlier than than what we

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.920 
ends a bit earlier than than what we
want<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.140> solve<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.980> banana<00:05:14.430> go<00:05:14.580> to

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
want it to so to solve that banana go to

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.630 
want it to so to solve that banana go to

won't<00:05:20.820> be<00:05:21.000> other<00:05:21.060> ways<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.570> do<00:05:21.690> in<00:05:21.840> this<00:05:21.960> book

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
won't be other ways to do in this book

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.080 
won't be other ways to do in this book
this<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.740> just<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.070> way<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.880> works

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
this is just the way that that works

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
this is just the way that that works
from<00:05:24.450> there<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:25.190> goes<00:05:26.190> with<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.460> lot<00:05:26.580> of<00:05:26.610> stuff

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
from there and goes with a lot of stuff

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.510 
from there and goes with a lot of stuff
this<00:05:28.110> more<00:05:28.320> not<00:05:28.650> be<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.890> way<00:05:29.010> that<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.370> do

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
this more not be the way that you do

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.610 
this more not be the way that you do
book<00:05:29.790> this<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.480> just<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.780> way<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.080> did<00:05:31.410> and

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
book this is just the way that I did and

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.090 
book this is just the way that I did and
the<00:05:32.010> way<00:05:32.040> that<00:05:32.340> he<00:05:32.430> works<00:05:32.640> for<00:05:32.910> me<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:34.710> once

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
the way that he works for me so so once

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.020 
the way that he works for me so so once
we've<00:05:35.280> added<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:36.660> layer<00:05:37.820> enable<00:05:38.820> time

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
we've added the layer enable time

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.830 
we've added the layer enable time
remapping<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.900> just<00:05:40.860> allows<00:05:41.130> us<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.840> to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
remapping that just allows us to to

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.450 
remapping that just allows us to to
stretch<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.380> clip<00:05:43.530> out<00:05:44.450> so<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:45.750> can<00:05:45.780> see

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
stretch the clip out so that you can see

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.250 
stretch the clip out so that you can see
he<00:05:47.460> carries<00:05:47.940> on<00:05:48.060> after<00:05:48.450> thee<00:05:48.630> after<00:05:49.140> we've

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
he carries on after thee after we've

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.240 
he carries on after thee after we've
stretched<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.740> Clipper<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:51.470> that's<00:05:52.470> that's

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
stretched the Clipper and that's that's

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.890 
stretched the Clipper and that's that's
basically<00:05:53.490> all<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:54.060> need<00:05:54.210> to<00:05:54.330> do<00:05:54.480> I<00:05:54.660> mean<00:05:54.870> you

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
basically all you need to do I mean you

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.050 
basically all you need to do I mean you
can<00:05:55.140> play<00:05:55.260> around<00:05:55.440> with<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:56.669> motion

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
can play around with the motion

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.390 
can play around with the motion
sensitivity<00:05:57.690> and<00:06:00.440> but<00:06:01.440> to<00:06:01.830> be<00:06:01.950> honest<00:06:02.220> it

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
sensitivity and but to be honest it

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.420 
sensitivity and but to be honest it
looks<00:06:02.730> pretty<00:06:03.300> good<00:06:03.419> as<00:06:03.600> as<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.140> and

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
looks pretty good as as it is and

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.550 
looks pretty good as as it is and
twixtor<00:06:05.430> won't<00:06:05.610> work<00:06:05.820> on<00:06:06.090> all<00:06:06.330> clips<00:06:06.780> this
