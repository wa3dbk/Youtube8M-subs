00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.700
 let's learn how the 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.400
 bridge in a neighborhood no matter what it is 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.660
 a neighborhood of four strings of five 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.789
 six 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.669
 a mandolin bath does not matter the 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.630
 mathematical physical principle that governs them 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.630
 is the same 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 so here you must do it 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.910
 first lift 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.220
 I recommend the bridge to loosen the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.239
 strings do not do this with 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.470
 strained strings as they usually are 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 if not 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:43.210
 loose 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.579
 we raise it we raise it slowly 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.120
 Y 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.839
 we place each rope in the south what 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.079
 have planned there are they we see the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:00.809
 caves urging loose 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.809
 Now the important thing is 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.080
 that if the bridge is properly placed 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.760
 banjo will assign correctly if not 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 is well placed never good can 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.610
 assign it will never be able to fine tune 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.190
 correctly 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.650
 the physical principle that I spoke to 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.510
 principle is the following a string is 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.050
 a principle of 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.590
 pitÃ¡goras a rope divided to the middle 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.320
 exactly gives us an octave or we 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.850
 gives the same note but one octave more 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.710
 up if I pressed until the world 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.590
 exactly half and gives us another two 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:45.040
 but one is higher we are not going to 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:50.580
 do is think one of the strings or yes 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.580
 so I show you exactly 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:03.310
 fret 12 that this 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.000
 10 11 12 1012 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.000
 press 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.950
 and if the bridge is properly placed 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.950
 course well let's put normal 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.489
 there you hear very low the eighth but 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.790
 these mathematicians do not worry 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.400
 we measure exactly the distance there 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.340
 from the schools from inside the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.770
 schools not from here outside but from 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.720
 inside there 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.730
 both between 12 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.900
 and if I'm going to do it so that the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.900
 two centimeters 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.750
 the cusp the fret to the schools 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.620
 we have there 30 and 35 centimeters 30 and 35 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.140
 centimeters that same exact distance 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.600
 is going to have to have 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.700
 from east 30 and 35 to the bridge 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.530
 here it is far away we are going to have to do 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.670
 Charles 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.209
 exactly up 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.500
 the 30 and 35 lack a little more what 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.410
 we accommodate 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.470
 and there we have it, let's see if it's 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.470
 true 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.600
 there is nothing but another proof that we have is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.730
 that this same note 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.240
 we're going to have to hear from this 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.920
 side pressing here and now 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.670
 we change from here 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.430
 and we listened to the note we passed the finger to 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.439
 next space and 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.860
 you have to listen to the same note 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.930
 exact 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.830
 lower of course because why are you 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.830
 living the patch but 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.000
 does not have exactly the same note 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.000
 there is possibility of error 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.140
 there we will have the bridge well 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.230
 placed at all times when it 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.010
 move or out there playing an instrument 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.959
 it is common that it can be twisted 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.609
 put devastated and this has to be 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.380
 perfectly perpendicular 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.390
 perpendicular 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.729
 to the ropes and the tensioner this bar the 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.759
 Pizza 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.159
 that holds the strings of these strings 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.860
 have to keep it sufficiently 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:41.900
 down as to keep the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.669
 pressure remember that the bridge does not go 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.789
 stuck in any way but simply 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.939
 is subject to the pressure that the 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.169
 strings on it there is no other way to 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.339
 place it 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:59.710
 so remember, I insist again 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:03.880
 exactly the number 12 fret 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.810
 the distance between this suit and the 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:12.130
 schools must be exactly equal to the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:17.230
 what is between the 12th fret and the cusp 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:21.580
 of the bridge neither more nor less because if 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.520
 have more forward going to sound 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.840
 much more 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.300
 sharper or more pitch much higher and 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.020
 this is that after the low tone and none 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.759
 in those ways will allow them to assign 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.610
 the instrument by each of these 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:44.060
 divisions is based on this division 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.060
 exactly mate materials
