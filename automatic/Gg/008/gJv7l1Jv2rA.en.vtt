hair<00:00:03.810> with<00:00:04.170> sunlight<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.950> hydrogen<00:00:05.609> peroxide

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
hair with sunlight and hydrogen peroxide

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.960 
hair with sunlight and hydrogen peroxide
so<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:07.109> tried<00:00:07.379> basically<00:00:07.859> every<00:00:08.309> home

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
so I have tried basically every home

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.270 
so I have tried basically every home
method<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.870> lightning<00:00:10.650> or<00:00:10.830> bleaching<00:00:11.099> your

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
method of lightning or bleaching your

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.230 
method of lightning or bleaching your
hair<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.750> tried<00:00:13.019> lemon<00:00:13.769> juice<00:00:14.240> baking

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
hair I have tried lemon juice baking

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.099 
hair I have tried lemon juice baking
soda<00:00:15.680> salt<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.730> i<00:00:17.910> found<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.570> hydrogen

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
soda salt and i found that hydrogen

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.500 
soda salt and i found that hydrogen
peroxide<00:00:19.350> works<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.160> best<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.240> also

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
peroxide works the best and it also

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.189 
peroxide works the best and it also
works<00:00:21.960> better<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.699> able<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.390> let<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
works better if you are able to let the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380 
works better if you are able to let the
hydrogen<00:00:25.619> peroxide<00:00:26.010> dry<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.550> your<00:00:26.789> hair<00:00:27.000> while

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
hydrogen peroxide dry on your hair while

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.609 
hydrogen peroxide dry on your hair while
it's<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.660> sunlight<00:00:27.960> though<00:00:28.109> somehow<00:00:28.320> like

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's in sunlight though somehow like

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.400 
it's in sunlight though somehow like
activate<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.730> ingredient<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> peroxide

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
activate some ingredient in the peroxide

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
activate some ingredient in the peroxide
and<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.679> makes<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> work<00:00:32.250> better<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> first

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and it makes it work better so the first

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.479 
and it makes it work better so the first
thing<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.260> brush<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.920> your<00:00:35.070> hair<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
thing you do is brush out your hair to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
thing you do is brush out your hair to
get<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.760> any<00:00:36.000> tangles<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> just

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
get out any tangles and then you just

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
get out any tangles and then you just
need<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> pour<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> hydrogen<00:00:38.700> peroxide<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
need to pour the hydrogen peroxide in a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
need to pour the hydrogen peroxide in a
cup<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.950> apply<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.610> hair

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
cup and then just apply it to your hair

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.450 
cup and then just apply it to your hair
you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.899> any<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you can do this in any way that you can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
you can do this in any way that you can
think<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.059> usually<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:45.870> start<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.320> my

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
think of I usually just start with my

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
think of I usually just start with my
hands<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> dip<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.280> cup<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> then

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
hands and dip them in the cup and then

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.690 
hands and dip them in the cup and then
kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> bring<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.230> peroxide<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:50.489> hair

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
kind of bring the peroxide to my hair

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.189 
kind of bring the peroxide to my hair
but<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.000> spreading<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> thing

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
but like spreading it on kind of thing

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.920 
but like spreading it on kind of thing
and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.980> eventually<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.850> end<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.329> dunking<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and then eventually I end up dunking the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
and then eventually I end up dunking the
ends<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.530> most<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> hair<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.969> cup

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
ends and most of the hair into the cup

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
ends and most of the hair into the cup
and<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:57.899> hair<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.289> thin<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.890> why

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and my hair is really thin so that's why

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.490 
and my hair is really thin so that's why
that's<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.430> easy<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> end<00:01:01.320> up

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that's so easy to do and then I end up

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.250 
that's so easy to do and then I end up
pouring<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.190> excess<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.480> top<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pouring the excess on the top to get it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.440 
pouring the excess on the top to get it
all<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.860> top<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.280> head<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
all over the top of my head then you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.940 
all over the top of my head then you
just<00:01:06.630> seem<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> mix<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.350> mix<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.799> all

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
just seem to mix it up mix it all

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 
just seem to mix it up mix it all
together<00:01:08.159> by<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> tossing<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.810> make

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
together by like tossing it up to make

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
together by like tossing it up to make
sure<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.260> there's<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.619> even<00:01:10.770> coat<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
sure that there's an even coat of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.719 
sure that there's an even coat of
hydrogen<00:01:12.240> peroxide<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.470> head

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.980 
again and then you want to wash it and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
you're not going to see how the color

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.139 
you're not going to see how the color
actually<00:01:46.259> turned<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.829> until<00:01:47.189> after<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.820> wash

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

actually turned out until after you wash
your<00:01:48.329> hair<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.790> recommend

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
your hair and so I really recommend

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.800 
your hair and so I really recommend
using<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:52.130> conditioner<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.250> has<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:54.299> sort

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
using a conditioner that has some sort

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.550 
using a conditioner that has some sort
of<00:01:55.729> moisturizing<00:01:57.200> revitalizing<00:01:58.200> self

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
of moisturizing revitalizing self

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
of moisturizing revitalizing self
targeting<00:01:59.100> effect<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> once<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.450> hair

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
targeting effect in it once your hair

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
targeting effect in it once your hair
grows<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.380> roots<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> be

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
grows out your roots are going to be

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.780 
grows out your roots are going to be
your<00:02:02.640> natural<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
your natural color and so what I do is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.690 
your natural color and so what I do is
take<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.600> cotton<00:02:07.110> ball<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.429> put

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
take a cotton ball and then you just put

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.520 
take a cotton ball and then you just put
hydrogen<00:02:08.970> peroxide

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
hydrogen peroxide

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.630 
hydrogen peroxide
on<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.190> just<00:02:10.340> kind<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.520> like

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
on it and then you just kind of like

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.610 
on it and then you just kind of like
squeeze<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.240> or<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.690> dab<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.080> or<00:02:12.170> wipe<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.500> on
