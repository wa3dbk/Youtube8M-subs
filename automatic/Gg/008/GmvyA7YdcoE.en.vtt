00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to apply it to paradiddles now I'm going

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
to apply it to paradiddles now I'm going
to<00:00:26.880> take<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.330> i<00:00:27.359> did<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.900> practice<00:00:28.289> pad

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
to take what i did on the practice pad

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.060 
to take what i did on the practice pad
and<00:00:29.029> I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> basically<00:00:31.320> use<00:00:31.500> brush

and I'm going to basically use brush
sticks<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.899> brush<00:00:34.260> sticks<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> just

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
sticks so with brush sticks can I just

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.690 
sticks so with brush sticks can I just
say<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.790> i'm<00:00:36.059> using<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> fair<00:00:37.110> degree<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
say one thing i'm using a fair degree of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.479 
say one thing i'm using a fair degree of
risk<00:00:38.700> control<00:00:39.450> okay<00:00:40.260> there's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> lot<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> talk

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
risk control okay there's a lot of talk

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.100 
risk control okay there's a lot of talk
these<00:00:41.790> days<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.570> differences<00:00:43.050> between

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
these days about the differences between

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.410 
these days about the differences between
the<00:00:43.680> gladstone<00:00:44.280> technique<00:00:44.700> which<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> finger

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the gladstone technique which is finger

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.020 
the gladstone technique which is finger
control<00:00:45.840> I've<00:00:46.050> explained<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> many<00:00:47.579> times

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
control I've explained that many times

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
control I've explained that many times
on<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> show<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> molar

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
on the show and there's the molar

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
on the show and there's the molar
technique<00:00:50.910> which<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.239> explained<00:00:51.600> many

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
technique which I've explained many

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.959 
technique which I've explained many
times<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> show<00:00:53.030> when<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.270> start<00:00:54.660> using

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
times on the show when you start using

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
times on the show when you start using
implements<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.120> minimal<00:00:57.690> bounce<00:00:58.020> like

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
implements with minimal bounce like

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
implements with minimal bounce like
brush<00:00:58.829> sticks<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.399> brushes<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> these<00:01:00.870> kinds

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
brush sticks or brushes and these kinds

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.939 
brush sticks or brushes and these kinds
of<00:01:01.469> things<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> fair<00:01:04.350> degree<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> risk

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of things you need a fair degree of risk

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.789 
of things you need a fair degree of risk
control<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> gladstone<00:01:07.080> technique<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
control so the gladstone technique and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.399 
control so the gladstone technique and
even<00:01:08.010> billig<00:01:08.369> less<00:01:08.580> than<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> man<00:01:09.150> himself

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
even billig less than the man himself

I'll use my risks for that that kind of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.740 
I'll use my risks for that that kind of
thing<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.110> don't<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.580> oh<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.540> this

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
four so if I start doing that's

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.170 
four so if I start doing that's
syncopated<00:03:43.010> anything<00:03:43.370> basically<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
syncopated anything basically on the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.720 
syncopated anything basically on the
ends<00:03:44.629> if<00:03:44.750> you're<00:03:44.900> doing<00:03:45.139> a<00:03:45.200> quaver<00:03:45.859> or<00:03:46.220> kochak

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
ends if you're doing a quaver or kochak

ends if you're doing a quaver or kochak
on

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.300 

bit<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.350> rough<00:04:03.560> ending<00:04:03.740> but<00:04:03.980> there<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.280> go

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
bit of a rough ending but there you go

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.820 
bit of a rough ending but there you go
so<00:04:04.730> does<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:04.970> make<00:04:05.330> sense<00:04:05.570> okay<00:04:06.470> now<00:04:06.710> I'll

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
so does that make sense okay now I'll

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.830 
so does that make sense okay now I'll
pick<00:04:06.980> up<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.130> speed<00:04:07.520> a<00:04:07.580> little<00:04:07.760> bit<00:04:07.910> then<00:04:08.570> get

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
pick up the speed a little bit then get

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.570 
pick up the speed a little bit then get
