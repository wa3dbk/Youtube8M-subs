00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
and back to that again could be six

00:03:19.520 --> 00:04:05.670 
and back to that again could be six
would<00:03:20.060> be<00:03:20.090> 7:30<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.050> knife

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.910 

oh<00:04:06.870> good<00:04:07.870> exercise<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:11.049> you<00:04:11.170> got<00:04:11.290> those<00:04:11.469> chords

oh good exercise so you got those chords
now<00:04:12.159> he's<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.730> way<00:04:13.469> can<00:04:14.469> be<00:04:14.500> very<00:04:14.829> basic<00:04:15.010> it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
now he's the way can be very basic it

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.860 
now he's the way can be very basic it
can<00:04:16.030> be<00:04:16.239> as<00:04:16.750> fire<00:04:17.109> forcing<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.889> B<00:04:18.009> flat<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.310> G

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
can be as fire forcing is to B flat to G
