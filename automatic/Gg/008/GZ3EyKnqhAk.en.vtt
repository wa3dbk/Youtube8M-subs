said no it's not going to because of a
memory<00:00:49.680> issue<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.160> when<00:00:50.280> he<00:00:50.340> says<00:00:50.489> memory<00:00:50.789> he

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
memory issue so when he says memory he

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
memory issue so when he says memory he
doesn't<00:00:51.180> mean<00:00:51.270> storage<00:00:51.960> he<00:00:52.140> means<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.500> random

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
doesn't mean storage he means a random

access<00:00:53.309> memory<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.820> Ram

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
access memory or Ram

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.040

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
out before most devices have double that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.930 
out before most devices have double that
at<00:03:35.190> least

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
at least

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.910

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
almost all 512 megabytes of RAM because

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.170 
almost all 512 megabytes of RAM because
it's<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.610> looks<00:03:50.820> better<00:03:51.000> and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
it's more advanced that's just how it is

depressing because they're easily
capable<00:05:29.139> consoles<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:30.130> could<00:05:30.669> handle

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
capable consoles that could handle

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.840 
capable consoles that could handle
infinite<00:05:31.270> worlds<00:05:31.539> with<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:32.320> easily<00:05:33.010> but

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
infinite worlds with just easily but

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.129 
infinite worlds with just easily but

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
then again that doesn't mean that your

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.360 
then again that doesn't mean that your
phone<00:05:35.350> or<00:05:35.530> your<00:05:35.620> tablet<00:05:35.650> are<00:05:36.039> more<00:05:36.160> powerful
