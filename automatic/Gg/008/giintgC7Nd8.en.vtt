if something dies how do those nutrients
get<00:00:03.990> back<00:00:04.170> into<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.560> environment<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.549> we

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
get back into the environment how do we

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.810 
get back into the environment how do we
harvest<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.450> information<00:00:07.020> from<00:00:07.620> nature<00:00:08.160> to

harvest that information from nature to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.700 
harvest that information from nature to
benefit<00:00:09.330> humanity<00:00:12.230> one<00:00:13.230> thing<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.590> we've

benefit humanity one thing that we've

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.839 
benefit humanity one thing that we've
recognized<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.490> there<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:14.730> many

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
recognized is that there are many

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.670 
recognized is that there are many
insects<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.509> are<00:00:15.630> very<00:00:15.990> good<00:00:16.109> at<00:00:16.350> taking

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
insects that are very good at taking

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.810 
insects that are very good at taking
waste<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.750> turn<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> into<00:00:19.140> biomass<00:00:19.920> more

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
waste and turn it into biomass more

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.029 
waste and turn it into biomass more
insects<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:22.020> we're<00:00:22.199> doing<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.830> learning

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
insects what we're doing now is learning

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
insects what we're doing now is learning
how<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.580> harvest<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.090> protein<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> fat

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
how we can harvest the protein and fat

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.439 
how we can harvest the protein and fat
from<00:00:26.070> these<00:00:26.250> insects<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.910> turn<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> into<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
from these insects and turn it into a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.500 
from these insects and turn it into a
product<00:00:28.369> we<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.519> take<00:00:29.670> these<00:00:29.849> insects<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
product we can take these insects and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
product we can take these insects and
turn<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.689> into<00:00:30.840> feed<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:31.920> fed<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
turn it into feed that can be fed to the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.510 
turn it into feed that can be fed to the
animals<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.950> there's<00:00:34.950> different

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
animals that we think there's different

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.639 
animals that we think there's different
approaches<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.450> collect<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> insects

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
approaches to that collect the insects

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.610 
approaches to that collect the insects
and<00:00:37.800> chickens<00:00:38.129> eat<00:00:38.280> them<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.180> range

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
and chickens eat them on the range

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.139 
and chickens eat them on the range
another<00:00:40.620> approach<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.950> taking<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> larvae

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
another approach is taking the larvae

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.330 
another approach is taking the larvae
and<00:00:42.530> processing<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.890> isolate<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and processing them to isolate the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
and processing them to isolate the
protein<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.399> isolate<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> protein<00:00:51.420> out

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
protein so you isolate the protein out

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.729 
protein so you isolate the protein out
of<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.440> flower

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
of it and you end up with this flower

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.670 
of it and you end up with this flower
which<00:00:53.129> becomes<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.699> component<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.230> fee<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
which becomes a component from a fee and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
which becomes a component from a fee and
you<00:00:56.129> pelletize<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.300> food

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you pelletize it and you have your food

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
you pelletize it and you have your food
for<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:59.960> China<00:01:00.960> has<00:01:01.140> been<00:01:01.289> very<00:01:01.530> open<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
