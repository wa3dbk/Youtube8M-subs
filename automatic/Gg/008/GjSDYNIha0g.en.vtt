00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
pave low this is a pretty good gun I
really<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.449> him<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.720> silence<00:00:18.960> he<00:00:19.230> incites

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
really like him to silence he incites

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.210 
really like him to silence he incites
not<00:00:20.010> too<00:00:20.160> bad<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.230> feels<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.529> powerful<00:00:23.039> I

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
not too bad and feels really powerful I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
not too bad and feels really powerful I
don't<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.449> first<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.140> once<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
don't really like that first but once I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.650 
don't really like that first but once I
put<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.740> silencer<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.820> kick<00:00:27.029> proficiency

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
put the silencer in the kick proficiency

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.700 
put the silencer in the kick proficiency
on<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.550> very<00:00:29.550> much<00:00:29.730> liking<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.590> just<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
on it very much liking it now just as a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.520 
on it very much liking it now just as a
general<00:00:31.980> tip<00:00:32.520> I'd<00:00:32.730> probably<00:00:33.000> recommend<00:00:33.530> going

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
general tip I'd probably recommend going

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.440 
general tip I'd probably recommend going
to<00:00:34.800> kick<00:00:34.980> proficiency<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.640> pretty<00:00:36.059> much<00:00:36.210> any

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to kick proficiency on pretty much any

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.490 
to kick proficiency on pretty much any
gun<00:00:36.950> I'd<00:00:37.950> say<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.399> reducing<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> recoil<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
gun I'd say that reducing the recoil is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.110 
gun I'd say that reducing the recoil is
probably<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> best<00:00:41.460> things<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.879> do

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
probably one of the best things to do

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.260 
probably one of the best things to do
for<00:00:42.360> most<00:00:42.690> guns<00:00:43.219> two<00:00:44.219> attachments<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
for most guns two attachments is kind of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270 
for most guns two attachments is kind of
cool<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.750> honestly<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.620> iron<00:00:46.800> sights<00:00:47.039> aren't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
cool but honestly the iron sights aren't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.889 
cool but honestly the iron sights aren't
that<00:00:47.370> bad<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> guns<00:00:48.000> really<00:00:48.239> don't<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that bad the guns really don't have that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.920 
that bad the guns really don't have that
much<00:00:49.289> range<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.160> red<00:00:51.059> dots<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.780> not

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
much range so a red dots really not

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.090 
much range so a red dots really not
going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> help<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> whole<00:00:52.710> lot<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.070> should

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
going to help you a whole lot you should

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.790 
going to help you a whole lot you should
be<00:00:53.489> able<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.000> iron<00:00:54.360> site<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.500> close

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
be able to use that iron site at a close

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
be able to use that iron site at a close
to<00:00:55.980> medium<00:00:56.280> range<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:57.390> guns<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to medium range with the most guns so

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.360 
to medium range with the most guns so
kick<00:00:59.129> proficiency<00:00:59.850> usually<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> good<00:01:01.320> idea<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
kick proficiency usually a good idea so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.820 
kick proficiency usually a good idea so
I<00:01:02.399> played<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> game<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.750> few<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.769> hours

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
I played the game for a few more hours

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.690 
I played the game for a few more hours
now<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.600> some<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.049> insight<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.830> how

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
now and I have some more insight on how

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.890 
now and I have some more insight on how
good<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> actual<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.990> game<00:01:10.170> actually<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
good the actual the game actually is and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
good the actual the game actually is and
I'd<00:01:12.900> say<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.290> pretty<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I'd say it's pretty good but I have a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
I'd say it's pretty good but I have a
few<00:01:15.840> issues<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.750> one<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> game

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
few issues with it one is with the game

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.060 
few issues with it one is with the game
dynamic<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.140> something<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> they

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
dynamic and one is something that they

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.870 
dynamic and one is something that they
will<00:01:23.220> hopefully<00:01:23.610> fix<00:01:25.460> first<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
will hopefully fix first of all the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.630 
will hopefully fix first of all the
spawns<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.659> awful<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.979> absolutely

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
spawns are awful like absolutely

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.350 
spawns are awful like absolutely
horrible<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.680> hopefully<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.850> fixed

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
horrible this will hopefully be fixed

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.130 
horrible this will hopefully be fixed
soon<00:01:34.070> I'm<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.490> hoping<00:01:36.030> they'll<00:01:36.240> fix<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
soon I'm just hoping they'll fix it it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
soon I'm just hoping they'll fix it it
would<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.590> disappointing<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.490> they

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
would be really disappointing if they

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.289 
would be really disappointing if they
don't<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.049> i'm<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.560> sure<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:41.070> health<00:01:41.970> duty

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
don't but i'm not sure if health duty

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.310 
don't but i'm not sure if health duty
actually<00:01:42.720> fixes<00:01:43.380> spawns<00:01:44.180> i<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.200> i'm

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
actually fixes spawns i don't know i'm

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
actually fixes spawns i don't know i'm
not<00:01:46.470> sure<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.159> spawns<00:01:47.790> were<00:01:48.000> actually<00:01:48.420> been

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
not sure if spawns were actually been

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.370 
not sure if spawns were actually been
fixed<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.110> games<00:01:49.380> before<00:01:50.030> because<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:52.110> lot

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
fixed in games before because and a lot

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
fixed in games before because and a lot
of<00:01:52.409> other<00:01:52.740> cultures<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.549> seen

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
of other cultures I've seen

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.779 
of other cultures I've seen
really<00:01:54.299> terrible<00:01:55.079> spawns<00:01:55.500> throughout<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
really terrible spawns throughout the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.870 
really terrible spawns throughout the
game's<00:01:57.479> life<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.520> hoping<00:01:59.820> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
game's life but I'm really hoping that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
game's life but I'm really hoping that
they'll<00:02:00.119> fix<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> spawns<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.829> know

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
they'll fix the spawns because you know

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.350 
they'll fix the spawns because you know
there's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> times<00:02:02.759> where<00:02:03.060> you'll

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
there's a lot of times where you'll

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
there's a lot of times where you'll
spawn<00:02:03.659> right<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> front<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.470> an<00:02:04.590> enemy<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.100> an

about it and that really sucks and my

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
other issue is obviously assassin I

other issue is obviously assassin I
don't<00:02:31.950> know<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> lot<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> people<00:02:32.430> use<00:02:32.849> this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
don't know a lot of people use this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.900 
don't know a lot of people use this
without<00:02:33.360> stopping<00:02:34.049> power<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.549> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
without stopping power really it is the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.809 
without stopping power really it is the
best<00:02:36.209> perk<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.780> using<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:38.340> doesn't<00:02:38.700> mean

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
best perk to be using that doesn't mean

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.000 
best perk to be using that doesn't mean
you<00:02:38.970> should<00:02:39.180> use<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> best

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you should use it it's just the best

just seems to have too long of a list of
things<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:07.220> prevents<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.940> from<00:03:08.970> being<00:03:09.180> seen

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
things that prevents you from being seen

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.110 
things that prevents you from being seen
on<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.549> seems<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.819> little<00:03:11.970> bit

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
on and that just seems a little bit

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.379 
on and that just seems a little bit
unfair<00:03:12.829> plus<00:03:13.829> you<00:03:14.430> all<00:03:14.700> you're<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.060> giving

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
unfair plus you all you're really giving

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.500 
unfair plus you all you're really giving
up<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.810> maybe<00:03:16.019> like<00:03:16.109> quick<00:03:16.500> draw<00:03:16.769> or<00:03:16.980> hard<00:03:17.190> line

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
up is maybe like quick draw or hard line

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.650 
up is maybe like quick draw or hard line
to<00:03:18.510> get<00:03:18.950> assassin<00:03:19.950> which<00:03:20.280> really<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> little

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
to get assassin which really is a little

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.340 
to get assassin which really is a little
bit<00:03:21.780> too<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.290> little<00:03:22.680> bit<00:03:22.769> too<00:03:22.889> powerful<00:03:24.350> so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
bit too a little bit too powerful so

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.949 
bit too a little bit too powerful so
obviously<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.100> having<00:03:26.370> issues<00:03:26.459> back<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.780> only

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
obviously is having issues back the only

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.509 
obviously is having issues back the only
thing<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.530> not<00:03:28.680> really<00:03:28.889> sure<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.400> they

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
thing is I'm not really sure what they

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.580 
thing is I'm not really sure what they
could<00:03:29.730> do<00:03:29.910> about<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.239> because<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.560> know

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
could do about that because you know

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.870 
could do about that because you know
they<00:03:31.859> out<00:03:32.010> they've<00:03:32.220> already<00:03:32.340> designed<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
they out they've already designed the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.430 
they out they've already designed the
game<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.180> not<00:03:33.269> have<00:03:33.510> stopping<00:03:33.959> power<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:34.290> I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
game to not have stopping power so I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.470 
game to not have stopping power so I
doubt<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:34.889> put<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:36.299> would

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
doubt they put that in that would

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.180 
doubt they put that in that would
obviously<00:03:36.600> like<00:03:37.109> fix<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> issue<00:03:37.709> people

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
obviously like fix the issue people

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.430 
obviously like fix the issue people
wouldn't<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.639> using<00:03:39.060> assassin<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.109> there<00:03:40.319> was

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
wouldn't be using assassin if there was

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.140 
wouldn't be using assassin if there was
stopping<00:03:40.829> power<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.579> know<00:03:41.670> certain<00:03:42.120> people

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
stopping power you know certain people

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.629 
stopping power you know certain people
still<00:03:42.600> would<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.200> would<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.440> lot<00:03:43.769> less

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
still would but it would be a lot less

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.120 
still would but it would be a lot less
common<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.209> see<00:03:45.359> assassin<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> other

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
common to see assassin the other

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.370 
common to see assassin the other
solution<00:03:47.670> would<00:03:47.880> be<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.120> completely<00:03:49.049> remove

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
solution would be to completely remove

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.229 
solution would be to completely remove
it<00:03:49.560> from<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.799> game<00:03:50.069> which<00:03:50.700> i<00:03:50.910> think<00:03:50.970> would

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
it from the game which i think would

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.970 
it from the game which i think would
probably<00:03:51.599> work<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.319> know<00:03:52.440> there's<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.769> lot<00:03:52.859> of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
probably work you know there's a lot of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.890 
probably work you know there's a lot of
UAVs<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.430> then<00:03:54.060> there'd<00:03:54.269> be<00:03:54.389> no<00:03:54.540> way<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.660> hide

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
UAVs and then there'd be no way to hide

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.530 
UAVs and then there'd be no way to hide
from<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:55.579> there's<00:03:56.579> still<00:03:56.730> EMP<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
from it but there's still EMP in the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
from it but there's still EMP in the
game<00:03:57.720> there's<00:03:58.019> still<00:03:58.579> counter

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
game there's still counter

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.240 
game there's still counter
so<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.510> can<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.530> hide<00:04:02.800> from<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.130> I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
so you can you can hide from it I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.000 
so you can you can hide from it I
suppose<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:04.510> can<00:04:04.660> only<00:04:04.750> shoot<00:04:05.050> down<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.680> UAB

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
suppose you can only shoot down the UAB

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.260 
suppose you can only shoot down the UAB
like<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:07.090> not<00:04:07.300> really<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:07.750> powerful<00:04:08.350> and

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
like it's not really all powerful and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.030 
like it's not really all powerful and
even<00:04:10.270> if<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.630> is<00:04:10.840> just<00:04:11.110> deal<00:04:11.590> with<00:04:11.740> it<00:04:11.770> like

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
even if it is just deal with it like

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.920 
even if it is just deal with it like
it's<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.550> lot<00:04:12.940> better<00:04:13.030> than<00:04:13.240> everybody<00:04:13.450> using

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
it's a lot better than everybody using

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.080 
it's a lot better than everybody using
assassin<00:04:14.470> because<00:04:15.010> that's<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.910> way<00:04:15.940> things

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
assassin because that's the way things

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.210 
assassin because that's the way things
are<00:04:16.420> going<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.600> go<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.900> either<00:04:17.220> everyone's

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
are going to go it's either everyone's

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.560 
are going to go it's either everyone's
going<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.430> use<00:04:18.610> assassin<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.390> going<00:04:19.510> to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
going to use assassin it's going to

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.010 
going to use assassin it's going to
happen<00:04:19.720> eventually<00:04:19.959> right<00:04:20.590> now<00:04:21.750> some<00:04:22.750> games

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
happen eventually right now some games

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.780 
happen eventually right now some games
I'll<00:04:23.320> see<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.800> entire<00:04:24.040> enemy<00:04:24.220> team<00:04:24.310> using

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
I'll see the entire enemy team using

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.820 
I'll see the entire enemy team using
assassin<00:04:25.240> some<00:04:25.780> games<00:04:26.020> all<00:04:26.260> I'll<00:04:26.500> find<00:04:26.740> it

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
assassin some games all I'll find it

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.620 
assassin some games all I'll find it
good<00:04:27.220> lobby<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:27.880> know<00:04:28.120> there's<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.450> two

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
good lobby and you know there's like two

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.630 
good lobby and you know there's like two
or<00:04:28.750> three<00:04:28.780> people<00:04:29.110> using<00:04:29.560> assassin<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.520> it's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
or three people using assassin but it's

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.160 
or three people using assassin but it's
still<00:04:30.880> really<00:04:31.120> annoying<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.540> see<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.080> I

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
still really annoying to see it and I

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.850 
still really annoying to see it and I
don't<00:04:32.440> like<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.410> don't<00:04:35.620> know<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.740> guess

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
don't like it so I don't know I guess

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.470 
don't like it so I don't know I guess
they<00:04:36.160> could<00:04:36.400> remove<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.820> probably<00:04:37.210> not<00:04:37.330> gonna

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
they could remove it probably not gonna

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.470 
they could remove it probably not gonna
happen<00:04:37.690> um<00:04:38.620> one<00:04:39.340> thing<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.790> really<00:04:39.820> really

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
happen um one thing that really really

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.980 
happen um one thing that really really
bothers<00:04:40.720> me<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.890> still<00:04:42.190> hides<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.700> from

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
bothers me is it still hides you from

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.840 
bothers me is it still hides you from
advanced<00:04:43.990> UAV<00:04:44.230> which<00:04:44.710> is<00:04:44.830> like<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.010> 12<00:04:45.430> kill

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
advanced UAV which is like a 12 kill

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.780

streak<00:04:46.180> or<00:04:46.390> 12<00:04:47.080> points<00:04:47.560> tree<00:04:47.770> but<00:04:48.430> still

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
streak or 12 points tree but still

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.610 
streak or 12 points tree but still
advanced<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:49.870> he<00:04:50.020> seems<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.440> really

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
advanced you if he seems to be really

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.590

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
like I suppose I could not use UAVs but

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.170 
like I suppose I could not use UAVs but
I<00:05:47.830> already<00:05:47.950> don't<00:05:48.190> need<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.520> do<00:05:48.700> a<00:05:48.730> bee's<00:05:48.970> it's

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I already don't need to do a bee's it's

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.090 
I already don't need to do a bee's it's
my<00:05:49.330> teammates<00:05:49.810> getting<00:05:50.650> UAVs<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.930> then

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
my teammates getting UAVs and then

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.650 
my teammates getting UAVs and then
people<00:05:54.100> not<00:05:54.340> showing<00:05:54.580> up<00:05:54.820> on<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.030> radar<00:05:55.120> but<00:05:55.600> I

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
people not showing up on the radar but I

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.510 
people not showing up on the radar but I
have<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:56.020> and<00:05:56.200> like<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:56.770> suppose<00:05:57.100> I<00:05:57.160> could<00:05:57.190> not

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
have it and like I suppose I could not

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.730 
have it and like I suppose I could not
look<00:05:57.730> at<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:57.940> radar<00:05:58.120> but<00:05:58.480> then<00:05:58.690> like<00:05:59.230> I'm<00:05:59.500> at<00:05:59.710> a

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
look at the radar but then like I'm at a

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.650 
look at the radar but then like I'm at a
disadvantage<00:05:59.919> whenever<00:06:00.730> my<00:06:00.910> team<00:06:01.180> seek

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
disadvantage whenever my team seek

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.900 
disadvantage whenever my team seek
review<00:06:02.080> because<00:06:02.919> I<00:06:03.130> can<00:06:03.280> go<00:06:03.370> longer<00:06:03.550> look<00:06:03.820> at

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
review because I can go longer look at

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.330 
review because I can go longer look at
the<00:06:03.970> radar<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:05.350> know<00:06:05.560> people<00:06:05.710> say<00:06:06.010> not<00:06:06.220> to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
the radar and I know people say not to

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010 
the radar and I know people say not to
rely<00:06:06.550> on<00:06:06.580> it<00:06:06.850> but<00:06:07.000> like<00:06:07.030> you<00:06:07.600> know<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.780> see

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
rely on it but like you know you see

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.930 
rely on it but like you know you see
four<00:06:08.320> dots<00:06:08.530> you're<00:06:08.740> like<00:06:08.860> ah<00:06:08.979> four<00:06:09.340> dots<00:06:09.550> but

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
four dots you're like ah four dots but

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.330 
four dots you're like ah four dots but
it<00:06:10.539> doesn't<00:06:10.870> really<00:06:10.960> seem<00:06:11.350> to

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
it doesn't really seem to

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.580 
it doesn't really seem to
cross<00:06:13.180> your<00:06:13.210> mind<00:06:13.540> that<00:06:13.720> there's<00:06:14.050> only<00:06:14.110> four

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
cross your mind that there's only four

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.680 
cross your mind that there's only four
and<00:06:14.740> there<00:06:14.860> should<00:06:15.040> be<00:06:15.190> six<00:06:15.430> or<00:06:15.730> you<00:06:16.630> know

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
and there should be six or you know

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.030 
and there should be six or you know
there's<00:06:16.870> only<00:06:16.990> five<00:06:17.380> and<00:06:17.650> there<00:06:17.740> should<00:06:17.919> be

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
there's only five and there should be

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.670 
there's only five and there should be
nine<00:06:18.630> either<00:06:19.630> way<00:06:19.780> there's<00:06:20.020> still<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.230> lot<00:06:20.530> of

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
nine either way there's still a lot of

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.200 
nine either way there's still a lot of
things<00:06:20.860> that<00:06:21.010> really<00:06:21.250> like<00:06:21.460> about<00:06:21.610> this<00:06:21.910> game

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
things that really like about this game

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.080 
things that really like about this game
i<00:06:23.169> like<00:06:23.740> that<00:06:23.889> it<00:06:24.040> shows<00:06:24.220> you<00:06:24.430> like<00:06:24.610> how<00:06:24.910> many

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
i like that it shows you like how many

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.700 
i like that it shows you like how many
points<00:06:25.510> you<00:06:25.780> need<00:06:25.840> to<00:06:26.020> your<00:06:26.260> next<00:06:26.470> point

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
points you need to your next point

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.520 
points you need to your next point
street<00:06:27.070> i<00:06:27.910> like<00:06:28.540> how<00:06:28.660> your<00:06:28.870> point<00:06:29.229> streets

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
street i like how your point streets

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.010 
street i like how your point streets
reset<00:06:29.949> i<00:06:29.979> think<00:06:30.250> that's<00:06:30.430> really<00:06:30.760> awesome

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
reset i think that's really awesome

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.990 
reset i think that's really awesome
because<00:06:32.020> before<00:06:32.680> i'd<00:06:33.130> have<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.490> like<00:06:33.699> kill

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
because before i'd have to like kill

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.030 
because before i'd have to like kill
myself<00:06:34.210> in<00:06:34.720> this<00:06:35.139> is<00:06:35.320> an<00:06:35.410> example<00:06:35.710> of<00:06:35.889> the

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
myself in this is an example of the

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.070 
myself in this is an example of the
spawns<00:06:36.310> look<00:06:36.669> where<00:06:36.880> i<00:06:36.910> was<00:06:37.300> in<00:06:37.510> before<00:06:37.720> they

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
spawns look where i was in before they

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.600 
spawns look where i was in before they
spawned<00:06:38.470> and<00:06:38.770> now<00:06:39.220> look<00:06:39.460> third<00:06:40.120> one<00:06:40.530> yeah

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
spawned and now look third one yeah

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.980 
spawned and now look third one yeah
that's<00:06:42.610> the<00:06:42.850> way<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.150> spawns<00:06:43.419> work<00:06:43.720> in<00:06:43.870> this

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
that's the way the spawns work in this

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.100 
that's the way the spawns work in this
game<00:06:44.260> and<00:06:45.360> another<00:06:46.360> one's<00:06:46.600> gone<00:06:46.840> there<00:06:47.080> and

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
game and another one's gone there and

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.950 
game and another one's gone there and
they<00:06:47.260> spawn<00:06:47.500> there<00:06:47.680> again<00:06:48.010> and<00:06:48.540> this<00:06:49.540> is<00:06:49.750> a

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
they spawn there again and this is a

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.640 
they spawn there again and this is a
problem<00:06:50.440> I<00:06:50.830> really<00:06:51.780> don't<00:06:52.780> think<00:06:52.960> this<00:06:53.410> bond

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
problem I really don't think this bond

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.129 
problem I really don't think this bond
should<00:06:53.950> work<00:06:54.160> like<00:06:54.370> that<00:06:54.430> and<00:06:54.940> I<00:06:55.510> don't<00:06:56.050> know

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
should work like that and I don't know

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.379 
should work like that and I don't know
it's<00:06:56.530> almost<00:06:56.740> like<00:06:57.100> they<00:06:57.250> didn't<00:06:57.940> test<00:06:58.210> them

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
it's almost like they didn't test them

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.150 
it's almost like they didn't test them
at<00:06:58.510> all<00:06:58.660> because<00:06:58.870> it<00:06:59.110> happens<00:06:59.530> on<00:06:59.710> pretty<00:07:00.010> much

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
at all because it happens on pretty much

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.030 
at all because it happens on pretty much
every<00:07:00.639> map<00:07:01.020> and<00:07:02.020> it's<00:07:02.410> not<00:07:02.590> really<00:07:02.800> good<00:07:03.010> for

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
every map and it's not really good for

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.250 
every map and it's not really good for
me<00:07:03.520> in<00:07:03.910> their<00:07:04.240> spawn<00:07:04.570> and<00:07:04.810> it's<00:07:04.900> not<00:07:05.050> good<00:07:05.229> for

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
me in their spawn and it's not good for

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.590 
me in their spawn and it's not good for
them<00:07:05.590> because<00:07:06.130> there's<00:07:06.880> no<00:07:07.150> way<00:07:07.330> I'm<00:07:07.479> gonna

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
them because there's no way I'm gonna

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.879 
them because there's no way I'm gonna
make<00:07:07.840> it<00:07:07.960> out<00:07:08.080> of<00:07:08.110> that<00:07:08.229> they're<00:07:08.500> infinitely

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
make it out of that they're infinitely

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.320 
make it out of that they're infinitely
spawning<00:07:09.340> in<00:07:09.490> that<00:07:09.610> spot<00:07:09.880> like<00:07:10.060> I'm<00:07:10.180> going<00:07:10.270> to

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
spawning in that spot like I'm going to

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.790 
spawning in that spot like I'm going to
get<00:07:10.449> a<00:07:10.510> bunch<00:07:10.660> of<00:07:10.750> kills<00:07:10.990> but<00:07:11.229> I'm<00:07:11.350> eventually

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
get a bunch of kills but I'm eventually

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.890 
get a bunch of kills but I'm eventually
gonna<00:07:11.919> die<00:07:12.190> I'm<00:07:12.669> not<00:07:13.330> good<00:07:13.479> for<00:07:13.660> them<00:07:13.750> because

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
gonna die I'm not good for them because

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.990 
gonna die I'm not good for them because
they're<00:07:14.139> getting<00:07:14.350> spawn<00:07:14.620> killed<00:07:14.860> anyways<00:07:15.729> let

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
they're getting spawn killed anyways let

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
they're getting spawn killed anyways let
me<00:07:16.090> know<00:07:16.210> what<00:07:16.360> you<00:07:16.450> think<00:07:16.600> about<00:07:16.750> that

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.020 
me know what you think about that

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.060 
me know what you think about that
assassin<00:07:17.620> thing<00:07:17.889> and<00:07:18.930> the<00:07:19.930> spawns<00:07:20.320> if<00:07:20.680> you

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
assassin thing and the spawns if you

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.680 
assassin thing and the spawns if you
know<00:07:21.190> they<00:07:21.340> might<00:07:21.460> fix<00:07:21.729> her<00:07:21.910> whatever<00:07:22.150> have

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
know they might fix her whatever have

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.390 
know they might fix her whatever have
any<00:07:22.930> issues<00:07:23.229> with<00:07:23.260> the<00:07:23.500> spawns<00:07:23.770> if<00:07:23.979> you<00:07:24.100> found

any issues with the spawns if you found
