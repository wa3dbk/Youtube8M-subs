00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
chemical heart by Grinspoon on guitar

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.260 
chemical heart by Grinspoon on guitar
the<00:00:09.799> main<00:00:10.010> part<00:00:10.190> that<00:00:10.370> people<00:00:10.850> seem<00:00:11.090> to<00:00:11.120> have

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.270 
the main part that people seem to have

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.850 
the main part that people seem to have
trouble<00:00:11.719> with<00:00:11.840> is<00:00:12.020> the<00:00:12.170> main<00:00:12.350> riff<00:00:12.590> that's

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
trouble with is the main riff that's

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.189 
trouble with is the main riff that's
played<00:00:13.129> throughout<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.459> song<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.090> I<00:00:14.809> thought

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
played throughout the song and I thought

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.689 
played throughout the song and I thought
I'd<00:00:15.379> show<00:00:15.619> it<00:00:15.680> to<00:00:15.799> you<00:00:15.920> because<00:00:16.070> when<00:00:16.400> you<00:00:16.520> see

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
I'd show it to you because when you see

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.430 
I'd show it to you because when you see
it<00:00:16.789> visually<00:00:16.970> it's<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.449> bit<00:00:17.600> easier<00:00:18.020> to<00:00:18.140> get<00:00:18.320> it

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
it visually it's a bit easier to get it

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.800 
it visually it's a bit easier to get it
down<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.490> what<00:00:19.730> we're<00:00:19.880> gonna<00:00:19.939> do<00:00:20.240> is<00:00:20.359> start<00:00:20.599> off

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
down so what we're gonna do is start off

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.839 
down so what we're gonna do is start off
with<00:00:20.990> our<00:00:21.109> first<00:00:21.169> finger<00:00:21.800> on<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.980> 10th<00:00:22.310> fret

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
of the first string our second finger on

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.089 
of the first string our second finger on
the<00:00:25.789> second<00:00:26.210> string<00:00:26.240> of<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.779> 10th<00:00:27.050> fret<00:00:27.349> what

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.649 
the second string of the 10th fret what
you're<00:00:28.220> going<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.460> do<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.910> pluck<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.359> bottom

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
you're going to do is pluck the bottom

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.050 
you're going to do is pluck the bottom
string<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.320> then<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:30.890> first<00:00:31.339> and<00:00:31.640> second

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
string and then the first and second

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.270 
string and then the first and second
string

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
string

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.090 
string
and<00:00:33.370> then<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.910> fourth<00:00:34.149> string<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.710> do<00:00:35.920> this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
and then the fourth string you do this

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.889 
and then the fourth string you do this
twice<00:00:36.399> but<00:00:36.820> on<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.120> third<00:00:37.329> time<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:37.780> don't

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
twice but on the third time you don't

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.600 
twice but on the third time you don't
pluck<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.350> fourth<00:00:38.590> string<00:00:38.920> you<00:00:39.160> go<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.370> the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
pluck the fourth string you go to the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.490 
pluck the fourth string you go to the
eighth<00:00:39.760> fret<00:00:40.120> so

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.380 

and<00:00:44.590> so<00:00:45.219> instead<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.609> plucking<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.149> fourth

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
and so instead of plucking the fourth

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.840 
and so instead of plucking the fourth
string<00:00:46.719> you<00:00:46.960> slide<00:00:47.289> down<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:48.460> pluck<00:00:48.699> the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
string you slide down and pluck the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.130 
string you slide down and pluck the
first<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.300> second<00:00:49.660> string<00:00:49.899> again

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
first and second string again

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.160 
first and second string again
and<00:00:51.230> then<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.860> fourth<00:00:52.100> string<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.989> then<00:00:53.989> you

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
and then the fourth string and then you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.680 
and then the fourth string and then you
move<00:00:54.380> your<00:00:54.710> first<00:00:55.579> finger<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.270> seventh

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
move your first finger to the seventh

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.099

fret

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:08.780 

so<00:00:59.739> it<00:01:00.070> sounds<00:01:00.399> like<00:01:00.460> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.130 

the<00:01:09.790> next<00:01:10.120> part<00:01:10.330> I'm<00:01:10.450> going<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.660> show<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.900> is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
the next part I'm going to show you is

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.179 
the next part I'm going to show you is

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.370 

and<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:19.880> you're<00:01:20.030> gonna<00:01:20.149> put<00:01:20.450> your<00:01:20.600> first

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and then you're gonna put your first

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.800 
and then you're gonna put your first
finger<00:01:21.560> across<00:01:22.219> all<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.789> strings<00:01:23.119> except<00:01:23.659> for

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
finger across all the strings except for

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.080

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.340 
the sixth string get your third finger
and<00:01:26.509> put<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:28.090> third<00:01:29.090> string<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.899> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
and put it on the third string of the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.490 
and put it on the third string of the
fifth<00:01:30.770> fret<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:31.640> get<00:01:31.909> your<00:01:32.060> pinky<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.049> put

fifth fret then get your pinky and put

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.190 
fifth fret then get your pinky and put
it<00:01:33.590> on<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.090> second<00:01:35.090> string<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.840> sixth

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
it on the second string of the sixth

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.889 
it on the second string of the sixth
fret<00:01:37.689> and<00:01:38.689> then<00:01:39.109> you<00:01:39.259> slide<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.740> up<00:01:39.859> too<00:01:40.899> and

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
fret and then you slide it up too and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.580 
fret and then you slide it up too and
then<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:42.200> slide<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.590> back<00:01:42.770> down<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.340> again<00:01:44.590> so

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
then you slide it back down to again so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:58.340 
then you slide it back down to again so
it<00:01:45.679> should<00:01:45.890> sound<00:01:46.099> like<00:01:46.310> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.550 

and<00:01:59.210> then<00:02:00.210> there's<00:02:00.570> basically<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> bridge

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and then there's basically the bridge

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:12.950 
and then there's basically the bridge
which<00:02:01.830> goes<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.220> this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.770 

so<00:02:13.960> that's<00:02:14.410> pretty<00:02:14.680> much<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.100> whole<00:02:15.130> song

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so that's pretty much the whole song

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.930 
so that's pretty much the whole song
that<00:02:16.780> riff<00:02:17.020> plays<00:02:17.320> throughout<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.580> know<00:02:18.610> all

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
that riff plays throughout you know all

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.670 
that riff plays throughout you know all
the<00:02:19.090> verses<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.540> everything<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.530> then

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
the verses and everything and then

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.310 
the verses and everything and then
there's<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.100> chorus<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> bridge<00:02:21.910> so

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
there's just the chorus in the bridge so

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.310 
there's just the chorus in the bridge so
yeah<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.560> pretty<00:02:24.040> much<00:02:24.160> it
