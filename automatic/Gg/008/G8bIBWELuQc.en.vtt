we connect let's say my brain to the

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.419 
we connect let's say my brain to the
rest<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.029> car<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.569> and<00:02:00.170> not<00:02:00.889> worry<00:02:01.159> so

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
rest of the car and and not worry so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.789 
rest of the car and and not worry so
much<00:02:01.459> about<00:02:01.700> our<00:02:02.299> power<00:02:02.689> in<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.109> car<00:02:03.319> or<00:02:03.590> out

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
much about our power in the car or out

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.380 
much about our power in the car or out
braking<00:02:04.609> and<00:02:04.909> slowing<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.569> car<00:02:05.810> down<00:02:06.079> before

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
braking and slowing the car down before

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.180 
braking and slowing the car down before
it'll<00:02:08.390> take<00:02:08.569> some<00:02:08.750> work<00:02:08.810> no<00:02:09.410> doubt<00:02:09.440> about<00:02:09.770> that

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
it'll take some work no doubt about that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.730 
it'll take some work no doubt about that
but<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:10.729> quite<00:02:10.970> confident<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.810> by<00:02:12.020> April

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
but I'm quite confident that by April

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.540 
but I'm quite confident that by April
21st<00:02:13.250> which<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.060> when<00:02:14.300> we're<00:02:15.080> gonna<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.550> doing

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
21st which is when we're gonna be doing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.940 
21st which is when we're gonna be doing
our<00:02:16.670> first<00:02:16.849> race<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.599> new<00:02:17.720> girlfriend's<00:02:18.440> we

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
our first race in new girlfriend's we

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.620 
our first race in new girlfriend's we
should<00:02:19.160> be<00:02:19.340> more<00:02:19.910> or<00:02:19.970> less<00:02:20.180> ready<00:02:21.430> yeah<00:02:22.430> well

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
should be more or less ready yeah well

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.780 
should be more or less ready yeah well
mainly<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.830> find<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.190> way<00:02:25.370> for<00:02:25.640> me<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
mainly is to find a way for me to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.420 
mainly is to find a way for me to
operate<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.960> throttle<00:02:27.110> mechanism<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
operate the throttle mechanism and the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.580 
operate the throttle mechanism and the
brake<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.330> clutch

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
brake and the clutch

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.390 
brake and the clutch
most<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.700> stuff<00:02:31.970> will<00:02:32.540> be<00:02:33.160> operated<00:02:34.160> with

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
most of the stuff will be operated with

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.080 
most of the stuff will be operated with
controls<00:02:35.980> position<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.850> steering

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
controls position it on to the steering

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.700 
controls position it on to the steering
wheel<00:02:39.280> therefore<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> will<00:02:40.640> do<00:02:40.820> most<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.710> all

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
wheel therefore I will do most of all

wheel therefore I will do most of all
these<00:02:42.950> operations<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.910> my<00:02:44.090> hands<00:02:44.360> but<00:02:45.260> still

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
these operations with my hands but still

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.030 
these operations with my hands but still
we<00:02:46.070> planning<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.850> mount<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:48.290> special<00:02:48.770> brake

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
we planning to mount a special brake

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.550 
we planning to mount a special brake
pedal<00:02:49.430> which<00:02:49.640> will<00:02:49.880> allow<00:02:50.150> me<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.870> -<00:02:51.260> to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
pedal which will allow me to be - to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.740 
pedal which will allow me to be - to
slow<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.490> car<00:02:52.670> down<00:02:52.700> with<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.240> movement<00:02:53.660> of

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
slow the car down with the movement of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.460 
slow the car down with the movement of
my<00:02:53.930> hip<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.460> quite<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.360> simple<00:02:56.630> mechanism

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
my hip it is quite a simple mechanism

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.890 
my hip it is quite a simple mechanism
which<00:02:57.710> seems<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.130> be<00:02:58.250> working<00:02:59.120> well<00:02:59.420> and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
which seems to be working well and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.220 
which seems to be working well and
efficiently<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.770> my<00:03:01.100> previous<00:03:01.520> experience<00:03:02.030> in

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
efficiently in my previous experience in

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.630 
efficiently in my previous experience in
WTCC<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.560> also<00:03:04.310> when<00:03:04.460> I<00:03:04.490> drove<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:06.640> DTM

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
car last year in in October we had that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.710 
car last year in in October we had that
mechanism<00:03:13.010> which<00:03:13.490> was<00:03:13.700> working<00:03:14.600> beautifully

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
mechanism which was working beautifully

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.560 
mechanism which was working beautifully
and<00:03:15.410> he's<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.040> sort<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.610> second<00:03:17.060> shoe<00:03:17.270> which

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
and he's a sort of a second shoe which

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.960 
and he's a sort of a second shoe which
is<00:03:17.750> mounted<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> top<00:03:18.710> of<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.980> brake<00:03:19.190> pedal

foot my prosthetic foot the entire time

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.610 
foot my prosthetic foot the entire time
and<00:03:25.490> basically<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:26.660> pressing<00:03:27.080> down<00:03:27.110> with<00:03:27.470> my

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
and basically just pressing down with my

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.220 
and basically just pressing down with my
hip<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:28.040> can<00:03:28.430> generate<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.480> pressure<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.960> takes

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
hip I can generate the pressure it takes

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.450 
hip I can generate the pressure it takes
to<00:03:30.440> slow<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.800> car<00:03:30.980> down<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:32.270> fact<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:33.460> the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
to slow the car down the fact that the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.390 
to slow the car down the fact that the
z4<00:03:35.180> gt3<00:03:35.720> car<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:37.480> already<00:03:40.960> electronically

z4 gt3 car it's already electronically
driven<00:03:43.400> as<00:03:44.270> far<00:03:44.570> as<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> total<00:03:45.710> mechanism<00:03:46.810> will

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
driven as far as a total mechanism will

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.200 
driven as far as a total mechanism will
certainly<00:03:48.640> give<00:03:49.640> us<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.880> big<00:03:50.180> advantage

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
certainly give us a big advantage

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.080 
certainly give us a big advantage
because<00:03:51.080> it's<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.590> question<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.100> putting

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
because it's just a question of putting

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.750 
because it's just a question of putting
a<00:03:53.540> potentiometer<00:03:54.350> onto<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.130> steering<00:03:55.370> wheel

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
a potentiometer onto the steering wheel

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.410 
a potentiometer onto the steering wheel
which<00:03:56.120> will<00:03:56.360> send<00:03:56.750> out<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.959> signal<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.940> that

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
which will send out a signal and that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.660 
which will send out a signal and that
should<00:03:59.750> make<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.020> total<00:04:00.709> mechanism<00:04:01.040> work

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
should make the total mechanism work

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.260 
should make the total mechanism work
well<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:04.160> clutch<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.670> little<00:04:04.970> bit<00:04:05.090> more

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
well and the clutch is a little bit more

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.870 
well and the clutch is a little bit more
complicated<00:04:05.720> but<00:04:06.670> from<00:04:07.670> my<00:04:08.030> last<00:04:08.330> experience

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
complicated but from my last experience

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.020 
complicated but from my last experience
which<00:04:10.880> lasted<00:04:11.390> until<00:04:11.570> 2000<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.470> now<00:04:12.680> in<00:04:13.030> now

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
which lasted until 2000 and now in now

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.240 
which lasted until 2000 and now in now
you<00:04:14.090> can<00:04:14.540> find<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.170> market

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you can find on the market

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.280 
you can find on the market
mechanisms<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:19.449> electronically

lead us to that hopefully to that point
the<00:05:13.330> enjoyable<00:05:13.960> part<00:05:14.260> therefore<00:05:15.250> as<00:05:15.370> I<00:05:15.520> said

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
the enjoyable part therefore as I said

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.450 
the enjoyable part therefore as I said
before<00:05:16.000> is<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.900> project<00:05:17.410> with<00:05:17.740> which<00:05:18.100> really

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
before is the project with which really

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.469 
before is the project with which really
matters<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:20.440> achieve<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.979> or<00:05:21.100> not<00:05:22.080> let<00:05:23.080> me<00:05:23.110> say

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
matters to achieve it or not let me say

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.879 
matters to achieve it or not let me say
that<00:05:25.479> is<00:05:25.660> relatively<00:05:26.380> important<00:05:27.250> of<00:05:27.700> course

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
that is relatively important of course

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.290

everyone and then you need to cash a
good<00:05:31.690> result<00:05:32.050> otherwise<00:05:32.590> it's<00:05:33.070> very

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
good result otherwise it's very
