 the defensive midfielder returns her to her favorite position 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.099
 a wise decision by coach Sven Kahlert incidentally today Lira Bajramai 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.459
 First there is a creative break 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.169

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.529
 aggressively despised minute

 Turid Knaak tries from a distance 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.849
 Nadine Angerer too far in front of her goal seemed almost surprised by the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.550
 Private sovereign with the number 10 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 a backup is the then aggravated first she throws the pace 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 Corner Thunebro on the head of Gerrit Kerstin Garefrekes 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.109

 Frankfurt 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.020
 a second is sitting Alexander Krieger who helps the opponents of the opponent 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 injured Claudia Götte from the field to wear 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 Values ​​suspected of metatarsal failure 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.060
 One way street football in ulrich haberland stadium the first one 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.940
 Betting scene is now loose 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.060
 combine Melanie Währinger Sara Thunebro and in the storm center Kerstin 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.420
 Garefrekes with the 1 0 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 the 24 minute game 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 no problem for the former national player after the good 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.570
 Preparation so on Balingen Gerd Alston Garefrekes again Melanie 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.510
 Behringer 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.010
 and the chance for when the dog the cops next week her 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 National team debut will be 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 she's late behind this ball 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.010
 again the first of the 10th 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.290
 with Meike Weber 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.290
 Kerstin Garefrekes and Jessica Landström 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.689
 She has to go on Sandra Smisek's cause 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.370
 it is going well for the first of the WFC but the chances of winning are not 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.190
 Problem of the team 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.990
 with the sun 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.850
 Bond Kochs before halftime break 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.840
 also the joy of playing 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.270
 especially with Sven Yavuz 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.510
 here at the ball 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.819
 also Jessica Landström 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.109
 and that secondly to strike 0 217 minutes after this price 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.109
 so it went into the half-time break 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.220
 the second half Sandra Smisek ranked first one hour 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.349
 foul-elfmeter to 13 04 the first FFC 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.359
 they are now back in the defensive midfield 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.629
 because her work then took only 45 minutes of creative break 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.639
 Lira Bajramai she can for Melanie Währinger and brings new momentum ins 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.859
 Frankfurt play 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.859
 Example 72 10 minutes 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.729
 Lira Bajramai 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:54.999
 perfect preparation for Annemarie Archer Norbert Scheed also came on as a substitute 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.669
 for Jessica Landström and equally successful 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.739
 Kerner German little with the 4 0 in the 77 minute 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:06.169
 Now the result is the same as the performance of both teams 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.729
 first she will want more 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.069
 78 minutes after preparation by 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.739
 Alex Krieger meets you at an area Chernow German little for 15 0 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.650
 Final score a deserved victory 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.910
