00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.500 
strategy was to stick hunting at the
fence<00:01:26.260> line<00:01:26.560> like<00:01:27.310> we<00:01:27.520> did<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.480> previous<00:01:28.510> time

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
fence line like we did the previous time

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.810 
fence line like we did the previous time
it<00:01:31.510> seemed<00:01:32.290> like<00:01:32.500> nothing<00:01:32.680> but<00:01:33.070> disturbances

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it seemed like nothing but disturbances

it seemed like nothing but disturbances
and<00:01:34.920> before<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.010> know<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.430> had<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.640> big<00:01:37.270> boar

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
and before you know we had a big boar

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.969 
and before you know we had a big boar
across<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.740> fence<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.930> decided<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.260> shoot

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
across the fence so I decided to shoot

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.390 
across the fence so I decided to shoot
that<00:01:42.310> boar<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.970> when<00:01:43.690> after<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.050> did<00:01:44.290> that<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
that boar and when after I did that the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.469 
that boar and when after I did that the
whole<00:01:46.150> area<00:01:46.690> was<00:01:46.900> completely<00:01:47.170> disturbed<00:01:48.010> and

whole area was completely disturbed and
we<00:01:49.479> had<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.960> think<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.190> new<00:01:51.490> spot<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.299> set<00:01:52.690> up

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900
