00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.720 

everything's<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:34.250> here's<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.430> actual

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
everything's out so here's the actual

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
everything's out so here's the actual
mount<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:39.059> attach<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.690> ball<00:00:39.989> ball<00:00:40.590> mount

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
mount and you attach a ball ball mount

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
mount and you attach a ball ball mount
onto<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.510> guess<00:00:48.780> go

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
onto it see and this is to I guess go

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
onto it see and this is to I guess go
around<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> oh<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.879> replacement<00:00:51.120> for

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
around and oh it's a replacement for

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.520 
around and oh it's a replacement for
this<00:00:51.770> these<00:00:52.770> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> grippy<00:00:53.430> things<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
this these kind of grippy things and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.180 
this these kind of grippy things and
then<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.770> exactly<00:00:56.370> sure<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:58.039> think<00:00:59.039> this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
then I'm not exactly sure I think this

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
then I'm not exactly sure I think this
one<00:00:59.370> goes<00:00:59.550> around<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.030> tight<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.719> more<00:01:01.410> loose

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
one goes around for tight for more loose

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
one goes around for tight for more loose
objects<00:01:02.100> something<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> don't<00:01:02.789> need<00:01:02.969> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
objects something that you don't need to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.320 
objects something that you don't need to
grip<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.719> tight<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> let's<00:01:05.909> move<00:01:06.119> on

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
grip on as tight you on so let's move on

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.740 
grip on as tight you on so let's move on
to<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> rest<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> review<00:01:08.479> as<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> guys

mount<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.420> lifeproof<00:01:12.900> quick-release<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.400> I

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
mount from lifeproof quick-release and I

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.609 
mount from lifeproof quick-release and I
have<00:01:16.680> installed<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.720> quick-release<00:01:18.720> onto<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
have installed a quick-release onto the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.109 
have installed a quick-release onto the
back<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.159> nude<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:23.159> install<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
back of my nude and you install it and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
back of my nude and you install it and
like<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.549> think<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> clips<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.680> data

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
like this I think it clips in and data

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.480 
like this I think it clips in and data
clips<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.200> sturdy<00:01:31.470> doesn't<00:01:32.400> have

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
clips in so now it's sturdy doesn't have

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.240 
clips in so now it's sturdy doesn't have
very<00:01:32.579> much<00:01:32.790> wobble<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.770> except<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
very much wobble at all except for that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.840 
very much wobble at all except for that
turn<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.970> lock<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:37.189> now<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.369> locked

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
turn so you can lock it now it is locked

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.840 
turn so you can lock it now it is locked
and<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.930> won't<00:01:40.110> move<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> say<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and it won't move at all and say you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
and it won't move at all and say you
attach<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.509> bicycle<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.409> go

let's cut some up to some bike footage
from<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:48.229> does<00:01:49.229> pretty

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
from that so you can see does pretty

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:20.330 
from that so you can see does pretty
well<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.619> bumps<00:01:52.880> not<00:01:53.880> coming<00:01:54.119> off
