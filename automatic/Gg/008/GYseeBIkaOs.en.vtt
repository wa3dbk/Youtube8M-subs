00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.270
 it gave him time to reach 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.450
 pepito and today after so the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.240
 tutorials on how to solve the 3 x 3 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.219
 and before we go to the tutorials for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.599
 improve at three times three actually 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.330
 I'm going first you talk about the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
 nomenclature makes it movements the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.960
 official nomenclature ie 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 now so for the algorithms that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 will be more complicated there will be more 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.750
 little stories like for the Belgian 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.880
 and then it will not be easy if I tell you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 shows for example movements to be made to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.300
 retain them or write them down 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 so in fact I'm going to teach you all 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 the movements makes the notations 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.860
 for example we see the r u and that's 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.390
 for that to be much simpler to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
 remember to note and then likened 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.690
 so that's actually he's sitting 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.899
 different movements of face it's up to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.390
 to say that in fact we have here the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.559
 face so right so air so 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:03.809
 to fill and in English we had for pope 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:07.430
 she for left of for dawn f for 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.140
 france and b for bach 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.280
 so these are the moment signs 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 different and then in fact each 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.150
 movement to a3 has three possibilities in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 does we see while when you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.130
 turn a phase without turning in this 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.560
 meaning on the grave in this sense either in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.119
 make a half turn 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.740
 so in fact so here is for each face 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.329
 there will be three movements so I'm going 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.869
 start right away so by r so 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.350
 we will have r so it will be towards the top 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:44.340
 r prime down and then r22 half 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.100
 turn for a no actually I'm going to do 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.049
 she's actually that's what you need 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.430
 know that opposite faces in 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.850
 do one the opposing movements it's up to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 to say when we were doing we are going to do it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.610
 - so it's true that we end up with 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.270
 it when it descends less when 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:10.810
 we go back and eagle we called rr - 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:15.379
 1 2 and there will be wing - l2 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:21.470
 then we will have one to the left 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:27.879
 hull - var on the right and u2 so inverted 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:34.340
 on donations we will have less 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:38.690
 2 of the green ones on the right of the less in 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.849
 the left of the two then we will have 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.450
 f in the sense of the needles of a 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.840
 watch f premium or f - yes we can see 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:55.849
 price - also so f - an eagle in meaning 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:59.860
 inverse and f2f 2 ff - and so for 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:09.319
 backs that will be reversed so we will have b 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:10.819
 less than 2 here is enough 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.079
 to learn and then the meaning forget in 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.840
 does that every time it's the inverted 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.010
 it's opposite facing is reversed 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.660
 and then we can meet too 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.040
 now with tiny glasses 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.220
 that is to say, it's when we go 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.900
 take a big block so for example 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.569
 you will be able to re if they do not have yet to 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.359
 this movement it will be small air if we 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.780
 did that it would be small air - if we 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.959
 did that it would be a ca will be small 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.819
 So here it works seems so 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.819
 there we will have small ass etc 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.299
 it can also sometimes against w 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.760
 of a big rw temple or big w so 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.420
 it depends on the software in fact two 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.959
 even people who are voting 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.349
 then yes, it could also be 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:04.620
 actually finds the faces of the middle it's 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:11.390
 to say that my time for m for middle 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.390
 So we will have same price m and m 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.500
 so m prime n 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.930
 then after the others will meet him 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.900
 never will we ever come back from 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.669
 quite a few mistakes I do not even know 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.250
 not the meaning an eagle and there it will be s 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.110
 but we will never meet them 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.550
 m and still now it's rare 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.750
 that face there was a lot 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.490
 of algorithms with m 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.020
 but with the techniques that I do you 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.690
 would teach he will not there will be 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.280
 almost not so here it was 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.430
 nomenclature of the law by three by 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.289
 three and to teach you how to memorize 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.050
 algorithms more easily to them 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.360
 note and then do series of being 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.160
 if possible, so you can love 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.289
 the video you can subscribe to the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.669
 chain and then soon for 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.280
 new videos can comment on 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.510
 accept everything and then we run on 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.840
 now has a facebook page 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.970
 besides, to wait for pitot and 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.970
 so here come many dogs
