 last video neither that for you as 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 It works the skills in the doctor and today 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.290
 In this last ruth tutorial I promise 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.849
 to you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 I'll explain how the magic of the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.260
 terminal there are going to start contaminating 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 also the veil ana it was an example that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.949
 I chose to show that we can not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 it's not cheating the veil bruno guilherme 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:30.929
 leandro veil beauty the law and she will te 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.050
 order black is partnering with 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.050
 alexandre on pictures that prove it 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.380
 I already explained to you that in Mexico 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.330
 the cards can be divided between 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.860
 permanent and non-permanent and that 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.200
 permanent homes are the houses that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.880
 game in the field since the creation of the doctor 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.490
 have always been creatures 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.200
 land enchantments and artifacts was 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.000
 when then in the year 2007 with the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.700
 launch pad love that comes a 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.640
 new kind of magic a new permanent 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 are high platinum in mexico of ours 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.360
 players symbolize mages capable of 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.640
 travel though the plans of the multiverse 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.320
 therefore we are however tall 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.180
 the idea of ​​this new permanent was 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.910
 simulate the presence of other characters 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 like us in the middle of the game and so it was 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.180
 created a new mechanic completely 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.640
 unusual with the operation of these 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.920
 letters to those who played the past is 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.930
 going back to the doctor now freaks out because 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.940
 the cards are very different but we are going 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.310
 understand a little more how these things 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.990
 actually work let's start with a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.979
 The example I chose for you is there. 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.320
 ana of the veil 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.470
 Liliana of the cock appears magically in the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.420
 editing the first thing you go 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.869
 see in the house is the name of the catalina of the veil 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.880
 then cost and here in between you 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.380
 will have the permanent card type 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.229
 that in the case of a stop at high 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.690
 a subtype which case the libyan 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.759
 subtype is very important because 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.490
 quarterfinals they have one thing 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.229
 called the singularity rule is very 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.880
 similar to the rule of legends 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.530
 you learn that if you have a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.270
 Legendary permanent you can not 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.170
 control two legendary permanents with 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.820
 the same name 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.200
 if you put another permanent 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.819
 legendary with the same name 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.980
 one of these two permanents needs to be 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.250
 sacrificed which can only control a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 what and where does this apply on Wednesdays? 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.069
 final 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.290
 this applies precisely to our objective 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.830
 despite his candidate alienating himself from the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.690
 veil 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.270
 we have joy the day before the line of the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.910
 Senate about 'the last they are all 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.800
 letters full high subtitle liliana 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.850
 despite being in case of cooking 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.740
 many different 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.390
 the subtype is the same all of them are 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.160
 even though they may be years old 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.590
 different then the rule of legends 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.569
 apply here if you can not control 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.610
 a line on a girl's eve 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.990
 veil at the same time while being the fourth 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.120
 different you have to sacrifice 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.310
 one of them right 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.290
 then the descriptions of the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.319
 skills in the letter and here what now 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.540
 starts to get very 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.280
 use you will see in the corner some numbers 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.010
 followed by a positive or negative 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.659
 negative two points and a description if 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.579
 you pay attention to my video about 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.319
 the skills you will see that is about 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.030
 of activated abilities because they 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.409
 have the idea of ​​the activation course 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.180
 two points and the description of your 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.359
 ability how to understand how it 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.829
 works and works salt of more 1 - 1 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.950
 anyway what is this 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.230
 See here in the lower corner of 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 right number in the case of his house Ana 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.950
 of the veil number 3 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.340
 this number represents the markers of 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.950
 loyalty of this terminal would be 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.530
 these markers can be reduced or 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.879
 added this happens by activating the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.129
 signal abilities 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.109
 Look at the liliana ability of the veil 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.269
 you can put the marker 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.129
 rose from three to four and 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.260
 that the two players each in a house 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.239
 you can reduce it by two markers 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.099
 leave it only one 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.349
 and you can cause the player to 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.359
 sacrifice a creature and last one 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.219
 takes several markers that we were a team 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.379
 you give a little more effect 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.509
 say a little more exaggerated is 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.639
 this standard for all plateaus 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:10.739
 it seems very simple, but he should 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.209
 think it over, it's all very easy, I 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.159
 I can get active in these skills at 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.130
 that simple business that likes to 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.989
 is not good is the letters of Van Natta only 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.130
 can have their skills activated 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.060
 only once and only 1 you can play one 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.370
 spell 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.380
 meaning nothing of active skill 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.900
 No response to activate skill 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.940
 signed nightly viability of its 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.680
 only to activate them in your 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.699
 shift only during the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.610
 municipal 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.169
 to Carol but this is the opponent on the hour 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.699
 that the fate of the animal that makes a 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.039
 march that answer I can not 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.990
 stability in a car you can because 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.570
 when your name does not have a game 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.310
 priority is yours then you can activate 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.050
 the ability of your club on high before 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.300
 of your opponent to do anything 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.639
 just as you can go down a terrain 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.020
 generate for him without his 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.969
 to be able to respond that the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.740
 priority is your interest in the field 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.469
 the same thing happens with your terminal 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.270
 only if you do any other 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.349
 thing on your turn instead of active 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.000
 abiliity 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.710
 then your opponent won the right to 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.540
 answer beauty smart people 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.590
 Now, let's go, but some things. 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.690
 important to know about what 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.310
 could happen if the markers of 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.580
 loyalty reaches 0 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.150
 then subordinate destroyed simple 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.890
 like this 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.170
 This is how you destroy the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.910
 end you can remove from play you 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.800
 can destroy from a march as per 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.960
 example hero break or you can 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.030
 reduce markers to 0 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.090
 whether you are moving by activating 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.650
 your terminal skills or it is a 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.590
 of the more complex parts of the 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.480
 discharge causing damage to it when 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.370
 Are you playing with a newspaper cover? 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.170
 your opponents can choose which 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.400
 His creatures are with his planet. 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.880
 christmas instead of you 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.490
 in which case the damage would be caused to you 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.980
 it is caused in the plateaus so as to 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.950
 reduce these loyalty markers 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.570
 it 's legal and how it would work 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.520
 these marks of direct damage so that 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.590
 The more interesting you have a magic 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.680
 which can give so directly to the target player 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.280
 this damage can be redirected to the 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.530
 end of that one controlling remembering the 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.210
 plateau usually some players 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.990
 they say things like calvin klein 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.610
 swimming as the players do not if I 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.470
 I'll tell you that and I'm sure 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.030
 a legion of judges will want to kill me 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.370
 because of this but not they are not 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.110
 how can you do tony damage 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.860
 high as if he were the player is not 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.740
 that 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.440
 according to the description if it is a damage 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.300
 that you can cause the player to can 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.520
 be redirected to the end of that 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.430
 control is different 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.160
 as well as their right and without you 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.260
 learn in medical game dsm like i said 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.200
 for you in production and we players 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.390
 would be this end idea but not you 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.490
 can not bring down the hero of his 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.800
 opponent and win the game if starting 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.500
 You can choose the skate plateau 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.400
 a letter is a dumb thing but it is 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.900
 that's how it works 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.790
 so let's recap as you 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.360
 can final section reduce markers 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:13.270
 to 0 whether activating these skills is 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.670
 causing direct damage is either causing 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.560
 combat damage or even using 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.060
 how to compare the former sock who can 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.550
 remove all bookmarks 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.010
 after all 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.290
 markers the quarterfinals only 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.080
 permanent income rule applies 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.810
 they based on the subjective ones the 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.490
 South plateau skills activated only 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.770
 can be used once a year and 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.570
 only one if you can play on the fish 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.680
 Sure it will be the video here for today.
