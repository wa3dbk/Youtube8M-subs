branch<00:00:48.600> nuts<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> beauty<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.129> technique

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
branch nuts the beauty of this technique

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.600 
branch nuts the beauty of this technique
is<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.030> doesn't<00:00:51.420> take<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> special<00:00:52.350> branch<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
is it doesn't take a special branch so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.830 
is it doesn't take a special branch so
just<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.239> rope<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
just get your rope up there and then in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.709 
just get your rope up there and then in
one<00:00:57.840> end<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:59.329> tie<00:01:00.559> your<00:01:01.559> loop<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
one end of it tie your loop I just do a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.310 
one end of it tie your loop I just do a
little<00:01:04.400> overhand<00:01:06.560> knot<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.700> carabiner<00:01:09.320> goes

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
little overhand knot the carabiner goes

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
little overhand knot the carabiner goes
in<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.740> loop<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.549> might<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
in that loop you might want to want to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
in that loop you might want to want to
show<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.490> close<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:15.180> okay<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:17.490> my

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
show this close here okay then get my

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
show this close here okay then get my
food<00:01:18.240> bag<00:01:19.670> I'm<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:23.869> loop<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.259> bag

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
food bag I'm going to just loop the bag

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.910 
food bag I'm going to just loop the bag
on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.130> carabiner<00:01:26.659> now<00:01:27.659> come<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.650> close

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
on the carabiner now come up close

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.120 
on the carabiner now come up close
because<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.630> trick<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:32.060> take<00:01:33.060> my

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
because this is the trick I take my

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
because this is the trick I take my
other<00:01:35.180> my<00:01:36.180> loose<00:01:36.390> end<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.670> rope<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:40.200> goes

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
other my loose end of the rope it goes

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.230 
other my loose end of the rope it goes
just<00:01:41.250> through<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.329> carabiner

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.810 

alright<00:01:50.240> pull<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.380> tight<00:01:51.710> now<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:52.579> going<00:01:52.759> to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
alright pull it tight now it's going to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.160 
alright pull it tight now it's going to
start<00:01:53.090> lifting<00:01:53.380> ready<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.649> lift<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.220> bag<00:01:56.170> I'm
