00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
going to be talking to you about one of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.470 
going to be talking to you about one of
our<00:00:07.410> new<00:00:07.620> reflector<00:00:08.280> arms<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:09.240> particular

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
our new reflector arms this particular

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480 
our new reflector arms this particular
one<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> little<00:00:10.530> different<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
one is a little different because it is

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.299 
one is a little different because it is
a<00:00:11.759> centrefold<00:00:12.450> style<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.740> can<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
a centrefold style as you can see the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.400 
a centrefold style as you can see the
poles<00:00:14.519> go<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> either<00:00:15.089> side<00:00:15.269> now<00:00:16.049> most<00:00:16.289> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
poles go out to either side now most of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.689 
poles go out to either side now most of
the<00:00:16.529> reflects<00:00:16.859> your<00:00:16.949> arms<00:00:17.190> are<00:00:17.340> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.580> see

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the reflects your arms are going to see

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.700 
the reflects your arms are going to see
in<00:00:17.820> our<00:00:17.940> catalog<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.690> all<00:00:18.869> off<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.680> side

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
in our catalog are all off to one side

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
in our catalog are all off to one side
which<00:00:20.520> means<00:00:20.789> our<00:00:20.939> kind<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> heavier<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
which means our kind of heavier and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
which means our kind of heavier and
waited<00:00:22.170> because<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.460> centered<00:00:23.910> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
waited because this one is centered it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.820 
waited because this one is centered it
means<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.990> put<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.470> lighter

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
means that you can put it on lighter

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.950 
means that you can put it on lighter
weight<00:00:26.099> stands<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:26.880> heavy<00:00:27.390> weight<00:00:27.630> stands

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
weight stands or heavy weight stands

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.259 
weight stands or heavy weight stands
whatever<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.560> prefer<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:30.060> going

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
whatever you prefer but it's not going

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.939 
whatever you prefer but it's not going
to<00:00:30.390> throw<00:00:30.539> off<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> center<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> balance<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to throw off the center of balance and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.850 
to throw off the center of balance and
wait<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> item<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.940> side<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> look

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
wait the item to one side so if you look

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
wait the item to one side so if you look
at<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> loosen<00:00:36.329> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
at this you can kind of loosen this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.500 
at this you can kind of loosen this
center<00:00:36.989> off<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.950> adjust<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> item<00:00:39.239> one

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
center off and adjust the item one

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.139 
center off and adjust the item one
direction<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.200> another<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.879> part<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.000> why

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
direction or another and part of why

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.450 
direction or another and part of why
that's<00:00:42.390> still<00:00:42.629> helpful<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.460> because

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that's still helpful is because

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
that's still helpful is because
obviously<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> extend<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> arm<00:00:46.350> itself

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
obviously you can extend the arm itself

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.760 
obviously you can extend the arm itself
and<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> way<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.620> can

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and if it's all the way out here you can

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
and if it's all the way out here you can
see<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.610> far<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.360> no<00:00:52.289> longer

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
see that's a little far and no longer

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.729 
see that's a little far and no longer
centered<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:54.120> able<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.809> bring<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> back

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
centered so you're able to bring it back

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
centered so you're able to bring it back
to<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> center<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.399> balance<00:00:56.670> by<00:00:57.030> giving<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
to the center of balance by giving it a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.830 
to the center of balance by giving it a
walk<00:00:58.399> you'll<00:00:59.399> notice<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> also<00:01:00.210> has<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> thread

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
walk you'll notice it also has a thread

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
walk you'll notice it also has a thread
up<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> recreate<00:01:02.309> syou're

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
probably not going

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.560 
probably not going
anywhere<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.560> then<00:01:46.159> again<00:01:46.939> as<00:01:47.180> we<00:01:47.329> went<00:01:47.479> to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
anywhere and then again as we went to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.069 
anywhere and then again as we went to
behavioral<00:01:48.409> come<00:01:48.740> along<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:49.850> find<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
behavioral come along and find it the

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.679 
behavioral come along and find it the
correct<00:01:51.380> position<00:01:51.670> now<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.880> one<00:01:53.119> also<00:01:53.420> comes

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
correct position now this one also comes

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.840 
correct position now this one also comes
and<00:01:54.380> going<00:01:54.740> on<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:56.329> wall<00:01:56.659> head<00:01:57.250> which<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.640> can

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and going on a wall head which you can

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.330 
and going on a wall head which you can
see<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.450> controlled<00:02:00.409> by<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.590> handle<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
see is controlled by this handle on the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.870 
see is controlled by this handle on the
back<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.299> if<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:02.960> need<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.289> rotate<00:02:04.009> my<00:02:04.340> reflector

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
back so if I need to rotate my reflector

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.259 
back so if I need to rotate my reflector
downward<00:02:05.539> or<00:02:05.810> up<00:02:06.799> into<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.189> really<00:02:07.520> odd<00:02:07.789> angle

downward or up into a really odd angle

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.940 
downward or up into a really odd angle
so<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.750> bounce<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.649> ceiling

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
so that I can bounce it to the ceiling

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.430 
so that I can bounce it to the ceiling
or<00:02:10.280> down<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.090> floor<00:02:11.450> or<00:02:11.780> wherever<00:02:12.319> you're
