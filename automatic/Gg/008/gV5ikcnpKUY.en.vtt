00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.380 
okay I'm gonna show you how to put in a
double<00:00:04.589> flood<00:00:04.920> earplug<00:00:05.400> if<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.089> don't<00:00:06.299> know

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
double flood earplug if you don't know

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.470 
double flood earplug if you don't know
what<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:07.290> an<00:00:07.560> ear<00:00:07.919> plug<00:00:08.150> which<00:00:09.150> goes

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
what that is it's an ear plug which goes

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.720 
what that is it's an ear plug which goes
out<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.990> both<00:00:10.200> sides<00:00:11.059> usually<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> five

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
out on both sides usually this is a five

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.790 
out on both sides usually this is a five
millimeter<00:00:14.730> ear<00:00:15.299> plug<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.560> five

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
millimeter ear plug so it's five

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
millimeter ear plug so it's five
millimeters<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> middle<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.270> six

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
millimeters in the middle and it's six

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.179 
millimeters in the middle and it's six
on<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> outside<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.619> doesn't<00:00:19.949> slide<00:00:20.130> out

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
on the outside so it doesn't slide out

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.420 
on the outside so it doesn't slide out
Europe<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.880> you're<00:00:21.000> wearing<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:22.430> it's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
Europe when you're wearing it it's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
Europe when you're wearing it it's
really<00:00:23.789> difficult<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.359> put<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.689> small<00:00:25.410> ear

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
really difficult to put in small ear

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.310 
really difficult to put in small ear
plugs<00:00:26.090> because<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.330> can't<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.720> grip<00:00:28.140> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
plugs because you can't really grip it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.060 
plugs because you can't really grip it
very<00:00:28.619> well

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
very well

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.659 
very well
and<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.849> hurt<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.240> lot<00:00:30.420> sometimes<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and it can hurt a lot sometimes but the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.740 
and it can hurt a lot sometimes but the
way<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> did<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.870> had<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> five<00:00:34.710> millimeter

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
way I did it was I had a five millimeter

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
way I did it was I had a five millimeter
stretcher<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.480> had<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> for

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
stretcher this one and I had that in for

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.250 
stretcher this one and I had that in for
about<00:00:40.290> four<00:00:40.860> weeks<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.460> stretched<00:00:42.149> Tamia<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
about four weeks and stretched Tamia and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.250 
about four weeks and stretched Tamia and
I<00:00:43.739> tried<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.460> plug<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.079> really

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I tried to get my plug in but I'm really

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.700 
I tried to get my plug in but I'm really
hurt<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.579> well<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> what

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
hurt and I can get in very well so what

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.819 
hurt and I can get in very well so what
I<00:00:49.739> did<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.399> brought<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> six<00:00:51.120> millimeter

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
I did is I brought a six millimeter

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.279 
I did is I brought a six millimeter
silicone<00:00:52.829> stretcher<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.110> these<00:00:55.110> are

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
silicone stretcher and this these are

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
silicone stretcher and this these are
hard<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.160> I've<00:00:56.280> cut<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> sides

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
hard to get into so I've cut the sides

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.599 
hard to get into so I've cut the sides
dance<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.480> easy<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> again<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.500> put<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
dance it was easy it again I put this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.790 
dance it was easy it again I put this
one<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.719> day<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> just

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
one in for about day so it just

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.100 
one in for about day so it just
stretched<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.309> ear<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.850> bit<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.019> was

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
stretched my ear a bit more so it was

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
stretched my ear a bit more so it was
easier<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> plugin<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.790> way<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> get

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
easier to get the plugin so way to get

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
easier to get the plugin so way to get
the<00:01:09.119> plug-in<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.229> easier<00:01:10.710> sometimes

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the plug-in some it's easier sometimes

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
the plug-in some it's easier sometimes
so<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.939> help<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.689> vaseline<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so it can help to put vaseline on it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
so it can help to put vaseline on it
just<00:01:13.560> normal<00:01:14.070> Vaseline<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.729> try<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> put

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just normal Vaseline but try not to put

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
just normal Vaseline but try not to put
the<00:01:16.200> Vaseline<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> air<00:01:17.700> plug<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the Vaseline on the air plug because it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
the Vaseline on the air plug because it
can<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.810> hard<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.130> grip<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> try<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> put

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
can be hard to grip when you try to put

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.160 
can be hard to grip when you try to put
down<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:23.009> rid<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> Vaseline

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
down so if you just get rid of Vaseline

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
down so if you just get rid of Vaseline
and<00:01:25.170> put<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:26.070> ear<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:27.119> nothing<00:01:27.509> at

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and put it up on your ear or nothing at

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.460 
and put it up on your ear or nothing at
all<00:01:28.909> like<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.990> go<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> put<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
all like that and then go to put the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
all like that and then go to put the
earth<00:01:34.770> looking<00:01:35.250> sideways<00:01:35.840> like<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.710> it's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
earth looking sideways like that so it's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.289 
earth looking sideways like that so it's
on<00:01:40.890> its<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> push<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
on its side on and then you push it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.100 
on its side on and then you push it
through<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.240> I'll<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
through like that I'll do it through the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.830 
through like that I'll do it through the
back<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> easier<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> put

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
back so you can see it easier so you put

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
back so you can see it easier so you put
it<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.200> angle<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.829> should<00:01:50.100> just

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it in on an angle and you should just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.660 
it in on an angle and you should just
see<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.259> poking<00:01:52.259> through<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.700> hole

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
see it poking through the hole

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.910 
see it poking through the hole

of<00:02:12.470> your<00:02:12.920> yeah

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
of your yeah

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.160 
of your yeah
and<00:02:14.230> slowly<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.550> push<00:02:16.550> your<00:02:16.760> finger<00:02:17.170> around

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
and slowly just push your finger around

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.089 
and slowly just push your finger around
to<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> stretcher<00:02:21.130> more<00:02:22.130> than<00:02:22.280> every<00:02:22.580> other

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
to the stretcher more than every other

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.860 
to the stretcher more than every other
just<00:02:25.099> slight<00:02:25.519> keep<00:02:25.849> sliding<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.390> around<00:02:26.480> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
just slight keep sliding it around and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.290 
just slight keep sliding it around and
it<00:02:26.959> should<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:28.640> pop<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:29.180> hopefully<00:02:31.300> with

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
it should just pop in hopefully with

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.430 
it should just pop in hopefully with
that<00:02:32.330> yeah<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.690> same<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.200> get<00:02:36.319> it

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
that yeah and it's the same to get it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.600 
that yeah and it's the same to get it
out<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.180> hold<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:40.160> twist

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
out you just hold it like that and twist

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.870 
out you just hold it like that and twist
it<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.620> hold<00:02:42.620> your<00:02:42.799> own<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.310> twist<00:02:43.670> it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
it you hold your own just twist it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.870 
it you hold your own just twist it
around<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.930> should<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:46.330> come<00:02:47.330> on

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
around and it should just come on

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.710 
around and it should just come on
outside<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:50.720> that

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.500 

sometimes<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:55.100> helps<00:02:55.370> if<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.060> use<00:02:56.300> when

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
sometimes it helps if you use when

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.770 
sometimes it helps if you use when
you're<00:02:56.690> small<00:02:56.990> stretches<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:59.120> help<00:02:59.480> push

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
you're small stretches to just help push

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.380 
you're small stretches to just help push
it<00:02:59.960> through<00:03:00.080> push<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.190> around<00:03:01.250> instead<00:03:02.180> of

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
it through push it around instead of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.100 
it through push it around instead of
using<00:03:02.570> your<00:03:02.720> finger<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.340> see<00:03:04.580> that

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
using your finger so you can see that

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.070 
using your finger so you can see that
you<00:03:06.110> just<00:03:06.230> get<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.560> stretcher<00:03:07.450> up<00:03:08.450> over<00:03:08.990> the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
you just get the stretcher up over the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.330 
you just get the stretcher up over the
top<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.650> air<00:03:09.830> plug<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.260> can<00:03:12.470> see<00:03:12.800> it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
top of the air plug so you can see it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
top of the air plug so you can see it
ship<00:03:13.640> discover<00:03:14.210> what<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:16.210> when<00:03:17.210> you're

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
ship discover what that when you're

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.840 
ship discover what that when you're
doing<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.750> if<00:03:17.870> your<00:03:18.050> heart<00:03:18.320> starts<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.340> bleed<00:03:19.550> I
