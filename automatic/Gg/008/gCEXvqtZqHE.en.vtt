quote me it was something to do with

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.609 
quote me it was something to do with
them<00:02:05.850> when<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.689> were<00:02:06.750> at<00:02:06.960> Ferris<00:02:07.409> there

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
them when they were at Ferris there

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.339 
them when they were at Ferris there
Barry<00:02:08.550> asked<00:02:09.149> isn't<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.509> where<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.899> pilot

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
Barry asked isn't this where that pilot

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.830 
Barry asked isn't this where that pilot
disappeared

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
disappeared

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.990 
disappeared
but<00:02:12.500> they<00:02:12.709> took<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.099> out<00:02:13.129> for<00:02:13.430> some<00:02:13.580> reason<00:02:13.879> I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
but they took that out for some reason I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.550 
but they took that out for some reason I
guess<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:14.870> they<00:02:15.140> were<00:02:15.260> thinking<00:02:15.500> about

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
guess because they were thinking about

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.720 
guess because they were thinking about
making<00:02:15.830> Diggle<00:02:16.599> Jon<00:02:17.599> Stewart<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:19.519> would

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
making Diggle Jon Stewart and that would

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.420 
making Diggle Jon Stewart and that would
mean<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:19.989> how<00:02:20.989> Jordan<00:02:21.379> disappeared<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.280> he

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
mean that how Jordan disappeared so he

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.610 
mean that how Jordan disappeared so he
would<00:02:22.580> be<00:02:22.700> green<00:02:22.970> lantern<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.660> don't<00:02:24.050> know<00:02:24.170> I'm

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
and at least season 4 maybe if they're

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.559

just<00:02:57.739> now<00:02:58.160> taught<00:02:58.519> well<00:02:58.760> if<00:02:59.090> they've<00:02:59.360> been

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
just now taught well if they've been

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.350 
just now taught well if they've been
talking<00:02:59.810> about<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.849> it's<00:03:01.849> probably<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.269> to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
talking about it it's probably going to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.839 
talking about it it's probably going to

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
eventually either he's going to God or

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.830 
eventually either he's going to God or
become<00:03:43.220> green<00:03:43.430> lantern<00:03:43.819> I'd<00:03:43.970> rather<00:03:44.599> have

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
become green lantern I'd rather have

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.800 
become green lantern I'd rather have
green<00:03:45.109> lantern<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:46.970> yeah<00:03:47.180> she<00:03:47.510> was<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.690> only

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
green lantern but yeah she was the only

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.159 
green lantern but yeah she was the only
problem<00:03:48.019> with<00:03:48.410> this<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.829> is<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.599> in<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.840> movie

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
problem with this is is it is in a movie

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.289 
problem with this is is it is in a movie
if<00:03:51.560> they<00:03:51.919> don't<00:03:52.040> have<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.459> same<00:03:52.489> budget<00:03:52.940> as<00:03:53.239> a

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
if they don't have the same budget as a

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.629 
if they don't have the same budget as a
movie<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:53.840> they<00:03:53.959> couldn't<00:03:54.200> go<00:03:54.639> willy-nilly

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
movie so they couldn't go willy-nilly

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.539 
movie so they couldn't go willy-nilly
with<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.299> effects<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:57.139> Green<00:03:57.769> Lantern<00:03:57.799> so

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
with the effects on Green Lantern so

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.789 
with the effects on Green Lantern so
that<00:03:59.419> would<00:03:59.660> be<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.840> only<00:04:00.079> thing<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.470> think

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
that would be the only thing I think

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.460 
that would be the only thing I think
that<00:04:01.220> would<00:04:01.340> keep<00:04:01.609> them<00:04:01.880> from<00:04:02.239> doing<00:04:02.569> Green

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
that would keep them from doing Green

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.099 
that would keep them from doing Green
Lantern<00:04:03.919> on<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.430> CW<00:04:04.940> it's<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.720> budget

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
Lantern on the CW it's the budget

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.879 
Lantern on the CW it's the budget
because<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.889> mean<00:04:07.209> all<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.569> CGI<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.500> know<00:04:09.829> you

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
because I mean all that CGI I know you

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.580 
because I mean all that CGI I know you
have<00:04:10.130> super<00:04:10.370> speed<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.120> all<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.230> other<00:04:12.349> crap

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
have super speed and all that other crap

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.339 
have super speed and all that other crap
on<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:12.950> flash<00:04:13.250> fire<00:04:13.579> but<00:04:14.419> constructs<00:04:15.169> that

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
on the flash fire but constructs that

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.860 
on the flash fire but constructs that
would<00:04:15.709> probably<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.579> pretty<00:04:17.030> difficult<00:04:17.359> and

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
would probably be pretty difficult and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.009 
would probably be pretty difficult and
flying<00:04:18.909> well<00:04:19.909> they're<00:04:20.209> gonna<00:04:20.329> be<00:04:20.510> fine<00:04:20.750> with

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
flying well they're gonna be fine with

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.930 
flying well they're gonna be fine with
firestorm<00:04:21.560> but<00:04:22.039> I<00:04:22.070> mean<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.400> would<00:04:22.520> cost<00:04:22.700> a

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
firestorm but I mean it would cost a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.810 
firestorm but I mean it would cost a
shit<00:04:23.300> ton

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
shit ton

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.700 
shit ton
so<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.750> would<00:04:24.870> be<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> only<00:04:25.110> thing<00:04:25.410> keeping

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
so that would be the only thing keeping

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.950 
so that would be the only thing keeping
them<00:04:25.830> from<00:04:26.010> doing<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.400> do<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.090> think<00:04:27.480> they'll<00:04:27.690> do

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
them from doing it do I think they'll do

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.670 
them from doing it do I think they'll do
Green<00:04:28.590> Lantern<00:04:29.070> on<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:30.090> CW<00:04:30.570> arrow<00:04:31.070> maybe<00:04:32.120> that

Green Lantern on the CW arrow maybe that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.030

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
maybe maybe do I hope they'll do it hell

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.010
