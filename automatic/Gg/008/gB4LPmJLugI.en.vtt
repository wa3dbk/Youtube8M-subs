00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.869
 but then I go to the bathroom and today I'm not going 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.460

 simple is only a braid of 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.910
 fish with hair loose but if 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.040
 they want to know how to do it I made a video 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.750
 of four hairstyles for school as well 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.210
 that if they want it they will see click in the video 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.930
 that appears now or the investor below 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.930
 in the description 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.040
 and now for makeup is something super 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 super natural very simple too 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.780
 I'm only going to apply concealer in my 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.210
 dark circles and in the parts of my face where 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.820
 need that is basically my whole face 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.910
 of sadness but then I will blur 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.490
 with this blender glass and then I'm going to 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 apply powder so that everything stays in 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.100
 your place and try to eliminate the brightness 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.890
 that I have and then I'm going to apply 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.740
 bronzer for one that is a blas the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.570
 first it is blas to give it as a 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.000
 touch of color to my face 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.770
 and after putting some bronze 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.320
 for 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.640
 because I put balance I do not know why my 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.160
 face look tanned I do not know but 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.130
 for a lover and then of course what 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.050
 that you can never miss is mascara opponent 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.360
 from above of course and those below 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.920
 because I feel that if when you put down 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.320
 It makes a big difference and makes my 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.010
 eyes and my more open and I put a lip 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.020

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.240
 this for this routine that a whole 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.250
