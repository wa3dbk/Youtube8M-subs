00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
buy this this is well all they had they

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.010 
buy this this is well all they had they
took<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.399> pork<00:02:10.670> butt<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.090> they<00:02:11.600> cut<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.959> in

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
took the pork butt and they cut it in

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.540 
took the pork butt and they cut it in
half<00:02:12.230> right<00:02:12.500> down<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.800> middle<00:02:12.830> from<00:02:13.520> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
half right down the middle from the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.610 
half right down the middle from the
shoulder<00:02:13.970> blade<00:02:14.209> all<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.780> way<00:02:15.080> down<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
shoulder blade all the way down to the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.840 
shoulder blade all the way down to the
front<00:02:15.770> end<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.160> pork<00:02:16.459> roast

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
front end of the pork roast

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.690 
front end of the pork roast
so<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> pork<00:02:18.380> pot<00:02:18.620> would<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:18.920> about<00:02:19.100> twice<00:02:19.490> this

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
so a pork pot would be about twice this

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790 
so a pork pot would be about twice this
size<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.540> that's<00:02:20.720> okay<00:02:21.050> this<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.410> still<00:02:21.590> good

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
size but that's okay this is still good

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.020 
size but that's okay this is still good
meat<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.220> we're<00:02:22.370> still<00:02:22.580> going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> make<00:02:22.880> some

just barely cracked open you don't need

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.140 
just barely cracked open you don't need
much<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.989> our<00:04:22.800> fan<00:04:23.100> damper<00:04:23.520> on<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.729> bottom<00:04:24.060> is

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
much and our fan damper on the bottom is

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.390 
much and our fan damper on the bottom is
about<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.389> third<00:04:24.660> open<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.500> that's<00:04:26.070> all<00:04:26.250> you

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
about a third open and that's all you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.390 
about a third open and that's all you
need<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:27.360> cook<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.810> 75<00:04:28.259> on<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.710> acorn<00:04:29.160> with
