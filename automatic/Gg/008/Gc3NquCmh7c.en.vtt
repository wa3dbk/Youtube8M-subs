laces right there on my vs you see you
could<00:05:58.750> actually<00:05:59.699> connect<00:06:00.699> this<00:06:00.820> with<00:06:00.940> the

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
could actually connect this with the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.629 
could actually connect this with the
laces<00:06:01.419> so<00:06:01.539> you<00:06:01.630> could<00:06:01.810> decide<00:06:02.080> not<00:06:02.289> to<00:06:02.639> and
