his coach will ye deal with that as a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.740 
his coach will ye deal with that as a
management<00:01:00.520> team<00:01:00.790> well<00:01:01.270> I<00:01:01.329> think<00:01:01.480> Joe<00:01:01.719> is

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
management team well I think Joe is

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.090 
management team well I think Joe is
probably<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.110> little<00:01:02.170> bit<00:01:02.350> nervous<00:01:02.710> about<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
probably a little bit nervous about the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.639 
probably a little bit nervous about the
high<00:01:03.700> level<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.059> expectation<00:01:04.689> but<00:01:04.869> you<00:01:05.530> know

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
high level of expectation but you know

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:06.359 
high level of expectation but you know
at<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.799> end<00:01:05.829> of<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.130> day<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.280> think

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
at the end of the day I think

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.270 
at the end of the day I think
expectation<00:01:07.149> goals<00:01:07.329> with<00:01:07.540> success<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.280> Joe

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
expectation goals with success and Joe

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.410 
expectation goals with success and Joe
was<00:01:09.430> obviously<00:01:09.670> very<00:01:09.729> successful<00:01:10.329> with

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
was obviously very successful with

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.789 
was obviously very successful with
Leinster<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:10.960> there<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.229> lot<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.409> optimism

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
Leinster so there is a lot of optimism

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.929 
Leinster so there is a lot of optimism
out<00:01:12.039> there<00:01:12.219> there<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.520> very<00:01:12.759> high

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
out there there is a very high

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.230 
out there there is a very high
expectation<00:01:13.659> and<00:01:13.840> I<00:01:14.530> think<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.850> know<00:01:15.969> in

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
expectation and I think that you know in

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.779 
expectation and I think that you know in
reality<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.009> new<00:01:18.130> coaching<00:01:18.340> team<00:01:18.670> in

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
reality there's a new coaching team in

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.039 
reality there's a new coaching team in
place<00:01:18.909> there's<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.299> number<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.509> new<00:01:19.630> players<00:01:19.840> in

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
place there's a number of new players in

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.209 
place there's a number of new players in
the<00:01:20.139> squad<00:01:20.319> and<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.649> think<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:20.859> will<00:01:20.979> take<00:01:21.009> a

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
the squad and I think it will take a

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.399 
the squad and I think it will take a
while<00:01:21.459> to<00:01:21.819> to<00:01:22.270> bed<00:01:22.450> down<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.659> systems<00:01:23.139> and<00:01:23.259> get

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
while to to bed down the systems and get

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.949 
while to to bed down the systems and get
everything<00:01:23.619> right<00:01:23.829> but<00:01:24.130> at<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.759> same<00:01:24.909> time<00:01:25.149> we

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
everything right but at the same time we

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:27.330 
everything right but at the same time we
would<00:01:26.109> be<00:01:26.200> hoping<00:01:26.469> that<00:01:26.619> we<00:01:26.709> get<00:01:26.859> a<00:01:26.920> good

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
would be hoping that we get a good

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.529 
would be hoping that we get a good
result<00:01:27.490> against<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.969> mall<00:01:28.119> on<00:01:28.149> Saturday

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
result against the mall on Saturday

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:29.879 
result against the mall on Saturday
which<00:01:28.719> I<00:01:28.869> think<00:01:29.049> would<00:01:29.170> be<00:01:29.289> very<00:01:29.319> good<00:01:29.590> for<00:01:29.649> the

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:29.889 
which I think would be very good for the

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.620 
which I think would be very good for the
conference<00:01:30.279> not<00:01:30.670> only<00:01:30.819> for<00:01:30.999> the<00:01:31.119> team<00:01:31.270> but<00:01:31.450> for

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
conference not only for the team but for

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.860 
conference not only for the team but for
the<00:01:31.719> coaching<00:01:32.020> group<00:01:32.079> as<00:01:32.289> well

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.650 
change a coach he's bringing in new
fresh<00:02:06.250> ideas<00:02:06.640> obviously<00:02:07.360> some<00:02:07.510> of<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
fresh ideas obviously some of the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.910 
fresh ideas obviously some of the
Leinster<00:02:07.990> guys<00:02:08.170> would<00:02:08.380> be<00:02:08.470> used<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.770> those

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
Leinster guys would be used to those

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.320 
Leinster guys would be used to those
ideas<00:02:09.280> but<00:02:09.580> it'll<00:02:09.700> be<00:02:09.730> different<00:02:09.940> for<00:02:10.180> other

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
ideas but it'll be different for other

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.560 
ideas but it'll be different for other
players<00:02:10.600> wanted<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.190> think<00:02:12.910> since<00:02:13.360> we

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
players wanted now I think since we

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.410 
players wanted now I think since we
started<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.080> there's<00:02:14.320> been<00:02:14.440> new<00:02:14.560> ideas<00:02:15.420> for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
started that there's been new ideas for

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.970 
started that there's been new ideas for
us<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.690> well<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:17.080> not<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.650> know<00:02:17.770> it's<00:02:17.800> very

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
us as well it's not you know it's very

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.030 
us as well it's not you know it's very
much<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.300> kind<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> new<00:02:20.740> start

what's your target for November as

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.199 
what's your target for November as

winning<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:15.629> matches<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.700> getting<00:03:17.700> back

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
winning with matches is it getting back

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.640 
winning with matches is it getting back
confidence<00:03:18.480> back<00:03:18.660> into<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.050> group<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.500> think

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
confidence back into this group I think

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.110 
confidence back into this group I think
the<00:03:19.890> coaches<00:03:20.069> would<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.670> see<00:03:20.790> obviously

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the coaches would like to see obviously

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.699 
the coaches would like to see obviously
what<00:03:21.360> they're<00:03:21.510> what<00:03:21.810> they're<00:03:21.959> doing<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
what they're what they're doing on the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.280 
what they're what they're doing on the
training<00:03:22.920> part<00:03:23.160> put<00:03:23.370> into<00:03:23.550> practice<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
training part put into practice on the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.570 
training part put into practice on the
unmatched<00:03:25.290> day<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.739> think<00:03:26.310> that's<00:03:26.400> one

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
unmatched day I think that's one

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.150 
unmatched day I think that's one
expectation<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.269> think<00:03:27.450> we'd<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.810> see<00:03:28.160> an

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
expectation I think we'd like to see an

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.280 
expectation I think we'd like to see an
incremental<00:03:29.550> improvement<00:03:30.209> we<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:30.870> tweak<00:03:31.080> I

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
incremental improvement we can tweak I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.150 
incremental improvement we can tweak I
mean<00:03:31.440> there<00:03:31.620> are<00:03:31.709> three<00:03:31.950> different

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
mean there are three different

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.729 
mean there are three different
challenges<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:33.230> more<00:03:34.230> were<00:03:34.290> kind<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.500> going<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
challenges as more were kind of going to

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
best team in the world by far I mean

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.150 
best team in the world by far I mean
they've<00:03:51.390> had<00:03:51.420> an<00:03:51.599> extraordinary<00:03:51.840> year<00:03:52.319> their

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
they've had an extraordinary year their

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160 
they've had an extraordinary year their
own<00:03:53.280> beat<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.700> think<00:03:53.970> if<00:03:54.269> if<00:03:54.870> they<00:03:55.019> go

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
own beat and I think if if they go

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.630 
own beat and I think if if they go
through<00:03:55.410> Europe<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:55.950> beating<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.310> think<00:03:56.519> it'll

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
through Europe on beating I think it'll

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.770 
through Europe on beating I think it'll
be<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.849> first<00:03:57.030> time<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.420> calendar<00:03:57.660> year

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
be the first time in a calendar year

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.479 
be the first time in a calendar year
that<00:03:58.530> they've<00:03:58.680> gone<00:03:58.829> through<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.069> whole<00:03:59.099> year

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
that they've gone through a whole year

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.800 
that they've gone through a whole year
winning<00:03:59.819> all<00:04:00.000> their<00:04:00.180> matches<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:00.630> that's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
winning all their matches so that's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.380 
winning all their matches so that's
obviously<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.290> big<00:04:01.319> incentive<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.980> them<00:04:02.390> big

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
obviously a big incentive for them big

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.050 
obviously a big incentive for them big
