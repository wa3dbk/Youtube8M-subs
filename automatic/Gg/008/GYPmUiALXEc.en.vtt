00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
of that performance yesterday fantastic

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.339 
of that performance yesterday fantastic
not<00:00:10.679> surprising<00:00:11.250> though<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.580> think<00:00:12.349> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
not surprising though I think the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
not surprising though I think the
writings<00:00:13.620> been<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> wall<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.370> plenty<00:00:15.240> of

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
writings been on the wall for plenty of

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.500 
writings been on the wall for plenty of
months<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:16.699> it's<00:00:17.699> fantastic<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.330> see

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
months and I think it's fantastic to see

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.330 
months and I think it's fantastic to see
it's<00:00:18.720> back<00:00:19.320> where<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.680> Irish<00:00:19.890> team<00:00:20.070> should<00:00:20.310> be

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
it's back where the Irish team should be

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's back where the Irish team should be
with<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:21.570> sense<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.220> think<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.609> very

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
with what sense I think it's very

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.740 
with what sense I think it's very
obvious<00:00:23.939> there's<00:00:24.359> an<00:00:24.420> air<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.570> confidence

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
obvious there's an air of confidence

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.390 
obvious there's an air of confidence
about<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> team<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.890> might<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.220> seen

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
about this team that we might have seen

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.210 
about this team that we might have seen
in<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> previous<00:00:27.210> campaigns<00:00:28.070> met<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
in the previous campaigns met the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
in the previous campaigns met the
players<00:00:29.429> probably<00:00:29.970> before<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.779> game

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
players probably before the first game

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.420 
players probably before the first game
they<00:00:31.289> looked<00:00:31.439> very<00:00:31.590> confident<00:00:32.070> before<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
they looked very confident before the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.760 
they looked very confident before the
Scottish<00:00:32.759> game<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.469> watching<00:00:34.469> them

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
Scottish game and watching them

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
Scottish game and watching them
yesterday<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.610> their<00:00:36.420> preparation

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
yesterday I think they their preparation

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569 
yesterday I think they their preparation
breeds<00:00:37.380> confidence<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.250> you're<00:00:38.399> fully

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
breeds confidence and when you're fully

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.639 
breeds confidence and when you're fully
prepared<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> professional<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.809> think<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
prepared as a professional I think it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.950 
prepared as a professional I think it
gives<00:00:40.890> them<00:00:41.129> every<00:00:42.090> chance<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.390> perform<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
gives them every chance to perform and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240 
gives them every chance to perform and
that's<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:43.379> doing<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.860> they're

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that's what they're doing like they're

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.470 
that's what they're doing like they're
competing<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.760> each<00:00:44.910> other<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.420> think

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
competing with each other and I think

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.459 
competing with each other and I think
that's<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.870> great<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.079> they're<00:00:46.350> not

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that's a great thing they're not

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200 
that's a great thing they're not
competing<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> opposition<00:00:47.579> you're

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
competing with the opposition you're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
competing with the opposition you're
spotted<00:00:48.629> something<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.739> they

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
spotted something about how they

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
spotted something about how they
targeted<00:00:50.460> Mike<00:00:50.670> Phillips<00:00:50.940> yesterday<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.719> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
targeted Mike Phillips yesterday I I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.400 
targeted Mike Phillips yesterday I I
think<00:00:53.149> probably<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.809> big<00:00:54.989> difference

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
think probably the big difference

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.000 
think probably the big difference
between<00:00:56.480> charges<00:00:57.480> time<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.260> time<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
between charges time and my time is the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
between charges time and my time is the
rock<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> rock<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
rock you look at the rock know what is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.729 
rock you look at the rock know what is
happening<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.910> rock<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> war<00:01:04.229> zone<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
happening the rock is a war zone and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
happening the rock is a war zone and
Ireland<00:01:05.070> they're<00:01:05.159> dominating<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.869> just

to<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.610> when<00:03:38.760> he<00:03:38.790> mentioned<00:03:39.239> Omani<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.900> in

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
to it when he mentioned Omani and in

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.759 
to it when he mentioned Omani and in
slip<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.430> these<00:03:42.120> players<00:03:42.570> assume<00:03:43.350> a

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
slip and so on is these players assume a

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.860 
slip and so on is these players assume a
extremely<00:03:44.610> powerful<00:03:45.180> positions<00:03:45.720> on

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
extremely powerful positions on

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.479 
extremely powerful positions on
shiftable<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.980> think<00:03:47.250> he<00:03:47.370> said<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.209> also<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:49.170> is

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
shiftable I think he said but also it is

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.640 
shiftable I think he said but also it is
incredibly<00:03:50.489> dangerous<00:03:50.790> because<00:03:51.420> their<00:03:52.200> turn

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
incredibly dangerous because their turn

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.979 
incredibly dangerous because their turn
their<00:03:53.070> heads<00:03:53.340> are<00:03:53.730> Lord<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.269> their<00:03:54.420> needs<00:03:54.690> now

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
their heads are Lord in their needs now

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.830 
their heads are Lord in their needs now
what<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:55.980> calls<00:03:56.549> for<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.660> is

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
what this calls for I think is

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.490 
what this calls for I think is
extraordinary<00:03:58.470> bravery<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.640> courage<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:01.110> in

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
extraordinary bravery and courage to in

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.370 
extraordinary bravery and courage to in
the<00:04:01.650> search<00:04:02.070> for<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.549> ball<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.570> take<00:04:04.140> that

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
the search for the ball to take that

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.920 
the search for the ball to take that
physical<00:04:04.920> risk<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.610> think<00:04:05.790> Ireland<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.810> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
physical risk and I think Ireland do it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.740 
physical risk and I think Ireland do it
better<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:08.010> season<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.790> you've<00:04:08.970> ever<00:04:09.480> seen

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
better this season and you've ever seen

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.660 
better this season and you've ever seen
you've<00:04:10.230> won<00:04:10.440> Triple<00:04:10.829> Crowns<00:04:11.040> are<00:04:11.280> trekking<00:04:11.610> up

you've won Triple Crowns are trekking up

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.759 
you've won Triple Crowns are trekking up
this<00:04:12.120> team<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.810> state<00:04:13.079> it's<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.709> the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
this team in the state it's in and the

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.860 
this team in the state it's in and the
mood<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.430> arriving<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.180> there<00:04:15.390> will<00:04:15.750> they

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
mood it's in arriving in there will they

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.530 
mood it's in arriving in there will they
find<00:04:16.109> anything<00:04:16.470> they<00:04:16.979> haven't<00:04:17.160> expected<00:04:17.669> are

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
find anything they haven't expected are

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.180 
find anything they haven't expected are
they<00:04:18.720> well<00:04:18.900> they<00:04:19.200> will<00:04:19.380> England<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.160> a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
they well they will England is a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.070 
they well they will England is a
different<00:04:20.580> kettle<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:21.000> fish<00:04:21.060> about<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.720> it's

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
different kettle of fish about that it's

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.190 
different kettle of fish about that it's
80,000<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.310> think<00:04:24.000> Lancaster<00:04:24.630> has<00:04:24.780> their<00:04:24.990> team

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
80,000 I think Lancaster has their team

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.850 
80,000 I think Lancaster has their team
home<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.560> as<00:04:25.620> well

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
home and as well

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.689 
home and as well
I<00:04:25.909> think<00:04:26.909> they<00:04:27.720> nearly<00:04:27.930> blew<00:04:28.169> France<00:04:28.500> away<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
I think they nearly blew France away the

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.369 
I think they nearly blew France away the
speed<00:04:29.939> which<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.270> play<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.629> game<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.169> think

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
speed which to play the game and I think

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:32.629 
speed which to play the game and I think
they've<00:04:31.530> really<00:04:31.560> bought<00:04:31.979> into<00:04:32.129> a<00:04:32.280> new<00:04:32.400> culture

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
they've really bought into a new culture

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.610 
they've really bought into a new culture
in<00:04:32.939> England<00:04:33.270> they're<00:04:33.569> you<00:04:34.289> know<00:04:34.349> they've<00:04:34.590> lost

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
in England they're you know they've lost

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.559 
in England they're you know they've lost
all<00:04:34.949> their<00:04:35.159> arrogance<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:35.879> they're<00:04:36.360> very

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
all their arrogance and they're very

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.779 
all their arrogance and they're very
very<00:04:36.780> decent<00:04:37.229> rugby<00:04:37.500> team<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:38.159> don't<00:04:38.639> think

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
very decent rugby team I don't think

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.339 
very decent rugby team I don't think
there's<00:04:38.939> talented<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:39.479> us<00:04:39.659> in<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.199> three

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
there's talented as us in the three

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.830 
there's talented as us in the three
quarters<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:40.919> I<00:04:40.949> think<00:04:41.250> big<00:04:41.789> upfront<00:04:41.969> lay

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
quarters but I think big upfront lay

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.719 
quarters but I think big upfront lay
back<00:04:43.020> exactly<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.009> as<00:04:44.189> we<00:04:44.280> know<00:04:44.400> that's<00:04:44.550> where

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
back exactly and as we know that's where

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.820 
back exactly and as we know that's where
Test<00:04:44.909> rugby<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.330> won<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:45.689> Fire<00:04:46.319> will<00:04:46.349> kick<00:04:46.680> his

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
Test rugby is won and Fire will kick his

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.790 
Test rugby is won and Fire will kick his
goals<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:48.090> you're<00:04:48.599> away<00:04:48.810> from<00:04:49.110> home<00:04:49.349> when<00:04:49.650> they

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
goals so you're away from home when they

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.619 
goals so you're away from home when they
get<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.069> crowd<00:04:50.280> involved<00:04:50.669> it's<00:04:51.090> difficult

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
get the crowd involved it's difficult

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.070 
get the crowd involved it's difficult
but<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:52.050> record<00:04:52.530> air<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:52.949> fantastic<00:04:53.550> so

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
but I record air is fantastic so

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.600 
but I record air is fantastic so
