talking with friends in a game I can

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.400 
talking with friends in a game I can
actually<00:02:35.430> record<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.750> commentary

on a different audio channel and then

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.690 
on a different audio channel and then
decide<00:02:40.560> later<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.040> want<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> put<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.550> into

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
decide later if I want to put it into

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.780 
decide later if I want to put it into
the<00:02:41.910> game<00:02:42.090> or<00:02:42.330> change<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.959> volume

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the game or change the volume

the game or change the volume
independently<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.120> really<00:02:45.510> great<00:02:45.750> for

independently this is really great for

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.890 
independently this is really great for

editing sometimes you'll be having a
awesome<00:02:48.900> gameplay<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.650> hate<00:02:49.860> the

gameplay well that's easy you just don't

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.520 
gameplay well that's easy you just don't

when<00:03:28.860> you're<00:03:28.980> ready<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.370> start<00:03:29.580> recording<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
when you're ready to start recording you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.370 
when you're ready to start recording you
just<00:03:30.150> hit<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.570> button<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:30.959> when<00:03:31.260> you're

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
just hit the button and when you're

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.570 
just hit the button and when you're
ready<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.709> stop<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.100> just<00:03:32.130> hit<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.549> button

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
ready to stop you just hit the button

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.509 
ready to stop you just hit the button
again<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.660> sort<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.170> pulses<00:03:35.070> when<00:03:35.370> you're

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
again it's sort of pulses when you're

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.039 
again it's sort of pulses when you're
recording<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:36.120> let<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.390> know<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
recording to let you know that the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.050 
recording to let you know that the
device<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.440> actually<00:03:37.980> recording<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.610> really

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
device is actually recording I really

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580 
device is actually recording I really
like<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.450> feature<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.930> it's<00:03:40.049> nice<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.410> have

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
like this feature and it's nice to have

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.620 
like this feature and it's nice to have
some<00:03:41.130> sort<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.370> tactile<00:03:41.850> button<00:03:42.269> there<00:03:42.420> rather

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
some sort of tactile button there rather

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.810 
some sort of tactile button there rather
than<00:03:42.989> something<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.100> have<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> map<00:03:44.640> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
than something that you have to map to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.910 
than something that you have to map to
your<00:03:44.940> keyboard<00:03:45.180> now<00:03:45.840> record<00:03:46.290> central<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.890> a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
your keyboard now record central is a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.130 
your keyboard now record central is a
nice<00:03:47.190> piece<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.640> software<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.239> has<00:03:48.840> really

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
nice piece of software that has really

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.020 
nice piece of software that has really
gone<00:03:49.320> through<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> lot<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:49.950> changes<00:03:50.580> for<00:03:50.610> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
gone through a lot of changes for the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
gone through a lot of changes for the
better<00:03:51.209> since<00:03:51.510> its<00:03:51.750> release<00:03:51.959> when<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.799> first

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
better since its release when it first

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.680 
better since its release when it first
came<00:03:53.160> out<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.610> definitely<00:03:54.120> rough<00:03:54.510> around

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
came out it was definitely rough around

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.690 
came out it was definitely rough around
the<00:03:54.959> edge<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.320> some<00:03:55.530> bugs<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.280> there<00:03:56.489> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
the edge of some bugs here and there the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.210 
the edge of some bugs here and there the
recording<00:03:57.540> format<00:03:58.350> wasn't<00:03:58.830> as<00:03:58.920> nice<00:03:59.160> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
recording format wasn't as nice the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.520 
recording format wasn't as nice the
clarity<00:03:59.850> wasn't<00:04:00.180> quite<00:04:00.420> as<00:04:00.600> nice<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.049> what

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
clarity wasn't quite as nice but what

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.900 
clarity wasn't quite as nice but what
avermedia<00:04:02.100> has<00:04:02.190> been<00:04:02.310> doing<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.700> they've<00:04:02.730> been

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
avermedia has been doing is they've been

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.550 
avermedia has been doing is they've been
making<00:04:03.209> all<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.600> their<00:04:03.840> capture<00:04:04.260> devices

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
making all of their capture devices

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560 
making all of their capture devices
function<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.430> record<00:04:05.850> central<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.450> they've

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
function on record central and they've

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.660 
function on record central and they've
been<00:04:06.720> putting<00:04:06.959> all<00:04:07.200> their<00:04:07.549> engineering<00:04:08.549> their

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
been putting all their engineering their

been putting all their engineering their
software<00:04:08.970> engineering<00:04:09.450> efforts<00:04:09.840> into<00:04:10.170> this

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
software engineering efforts into this

software engineering efforts into this
one<00:04:10.500> piece<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.920> software<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.549> now<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.299> one

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
one piece of software so now this one

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.330 
one piece of software so now this one
piece<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.930> software<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.530> use<00:04:13.829> all<00:04:14.100> their

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
piece of software can use all their

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
piece of software can use all their
different<00:04:14.670> pieces<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:15.000> hardware<00:04:15.390> they<00:04:16.260> can

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
different pieces of hardware they can

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.310 
different pieces of hardware they can
record<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.979> multiple<00:04:17.489> formats<00:04:18.030> now<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:19.169> you

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
record to multiple formats now and you

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.840 
record to multiple formats now and you
have<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.500> lot<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.829> cool<00:04:20.010> little<00:04:20.160> options<00:04:20.669> in

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
have a lot of cool little options in

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.120 
have a lot of cool little options in
there<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.239> audio<00:04:21.630> bitrate<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.229> stuff<00:04:22.680> there

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
there like audio bitrate and stuff there

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.320 
there like audio bitrate and stuff there
have<00:04:23.310> been<00:04:23.490> some<00:04:23.669> options<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.270> been

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
have been some options that have been

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.090 
have been some options that have been
added<00:04:24.630> in

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
added in

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.340 
added in
taken<00:04:25.610> away<00:04:25.880> like<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.450> ability<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.020> control

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
taken away like the ability to control

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.230 
taken away like the ability to control
the<00:04:27.500> brightness<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:28.130> your<00:04:28.160> accord<00:04:28.700> of<00:04:28.910> your

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
the brightness of your accord of your

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.510 
the brightness of your accord of your
recording<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.200> other<00:04:30.350> things<00:04:30.650> like<00:04:30.830> that

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
recording and other things like that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.430 
recording and other things like that
I<00:04:31.550> guess<00:04:31.970> some<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.660> settings<00:04:33.080> weren't

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
I guess some of the settings weren't

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.380 
I guess some of the settings weren't
quite<00:04:33.770> roughed<00:04:34.280> out<00:04:34.490> when<00:04:34.850> they<00:04:34.970> put<00:04:35.150> them<00:04:35.270> in

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
quite roughed out when they put them in

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.210 
quite roughed out when they put them in
so<00:04:35.540> they<00:04:35.630> took<00:04:35.810> some<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:36.110> them<00:04:36.380> out<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.890> look

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
so they took some of them out I look

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.070 
so they took some of them out I look
forward<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.580> see<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.850> continual<00:04:38.630> development

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
forward to see the continual development

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.650 
forward to see the continual development
of<00:04:39.680> record<00:04:40.070> central<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.700> think<00:04:41.090> it's<00:04:41.210> good<00:04:41.450> but

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
of record central I think it's good but

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.110 
of record central I think it's good but
it's<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:42.020> excellent<00:04:42.680> quite<00:04:42.980> yet<00:04:43.280> there<00:04:43.610> again

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
it's not excellent quite yet there again

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.930 
it's not excellent quite yet there again
like<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.480> mentioned<00:04:44.840> how<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.020> TS<00:04:45.620> video<00:04:46.520> format

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
like I mentioned how the TS video format

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.420 
like I mentioned how the TS video format
doesn't<00:04:47.330> seem<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.690> bring<00:04:47.960> audio<00:04:48.440> into<00:04:48.800> Vegas<00:04:49.250> I

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
doesn't seem to bring audio into Vegas I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.400 
doesn't seem to bring audio into Vegas I
think<00:04:49.460> there's<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.880> few<00:04:50.150> different<00:04:50.570> tweaks

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
think there's a few different tweaks

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.750 
think there's a few different tweaks
that<00:04:51.650> they<00:04:51.800> could<00:04:51.980> make<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.310> some<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.610> their

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
that they could make to some of their

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.000 
that they could make to some of their
encoding<00:04:53.360> software<00:04:53.870> now<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.440> one<00:04:54.680> gripe<00:04:54.980> that

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
encoding software now the one gripe that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.790 
encoding software now the one gripe that
people<00:04:55.940> have<00:04:56.150> with<00:04:56.420> capture<00:04:56.870> cards<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.440> the

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
people have with capture cards is the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.820 
people have with capture cards is the
inability<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.550> really<00:04:59.000> control<00:04:59.600> some<00:05:00.320> of<00:05:00.350> this

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
inability to really control some of this

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.190 
inability to really control some of this
frame<00:05:01.580> tearing<00:05:02.120> now<00:05:02.360> frame<00:05:02.690> tearing<00:05:03.080> is

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
frame tearing now frame tearing is

implement this and to capture cards I
don't<00:05:39.170> know<00:05:39.470> if<00:05:39.590> it's<00:05:39.710> possible<00:05:40.010> or<00:05:40.580> how<00:05:40.640> easy

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
it would be but if they could get rid of

it would be but if they could get rid of
