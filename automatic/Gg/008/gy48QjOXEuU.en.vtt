 flyers boys are very enlightening 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.700
 the film became 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.110

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.129
 per cent 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.719
 if you have 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.129
 major 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.709
 we come s can work ball on the pole there came a very different after rest 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.539
 the potty seems to be young from time to time 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.609
 all my money 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.919
 okay the state structure 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.969
 this is the mound 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.809
 about box 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.430
 Going well boys became everyone against fakking 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.469
 the worst premier league 10 but note the name and just be our team 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.259
 is very good 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.749
 everything goes in verweij 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:41.799
 beautiful is well defended well defended after is nice work and then off 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.879
 ididid 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.049
 and not yet 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.389
 And yes then you can be on the right 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.349
 office 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.079
 Rob and where did that ball go back and forth was bad but it is required 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.079
 this can not seem like this was just a huge cup of alps 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.629
 but that one is right after the last one with the dancer being the news anyway 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.369
 been 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.559
 and 6 to see we have three shots on and he has the two we have two 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.899
 shots bull an egg one and were put in the sixteen percent ball 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.419
 they are doing much better than him anyway 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.810
 looks like his character with this team 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.329
 definitely can throw it with pennetta and one 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.340
 agion it and and that was already the bar a penalty for nothing 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.580
 nice boy 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.170
 that goalkeeper who's really got a good picture that said that I now also have a profession 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.700
 and could train and play 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700
 okay now new it must be dangerous 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.969
 green boy 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.350
 this is a pity 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.300
 it's a shame well I looked at the demonic will wear out a bit 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.120
 lanners a header must come because yes that's just it goes nice one 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.400
 pair of shoes and petrova 6 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.109
 i'm gonna shoot you goal 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.909
 and this year another chance 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.440
 and that ballin did have it all or so do menzis love kino a lighter 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.309
 forward 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.199
 what that box 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.199
 Open 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.070
 orie big 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.600
 count but we can even have a room to step up an attack 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.339
 became 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.339
 I had expected if I was very honest there 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.090
 well you insure new of many factors 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.789
 how the shit certainly had one of those goalkeepers, but a young coach I could 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.899
 him a parade longer in that goalkeeper, he took a lot longer last night 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.999
 a compilation 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.620
 johan rebound 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.409
 and now we are wanted 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.409
 you have now we are 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 I had hacks here anyway 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.379
 yes I can do it once I can't do much about it I can do it alone 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.249
 We had a good week there at sea 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.389
 the team in particular also did well in this competition for years, and de vries them 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.009
 a cia i might have had a aaa 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.530
 too bad he is like that with everything he has to get used to but grows 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.689
 yes what can i say 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.909
 and so was the share the national press that is out of the corner anyway 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.220
 always countered 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.200
 and as a new trainer always a bit of a car with a resolute back then 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.890
 lost now I can said we have raised head from greenlo learned it 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.070
 box his head ma well we still give up even when we lost we have 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.860
 pretty well played there after my 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.319
 yes i think actually because year old player of only 10 charles premier league team and 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.590
 yes to our psv against few golden so again a few rarely and that does not matter 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.599
 so much out but anyway they did not show it better what do you want it can 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.509
 you the start of the game are so by my advantage 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.460
 not sure 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.339
 the watching 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.699
 which is very short with the young them 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.610
 and here at the time I have 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.819
 shot down 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.839
 we have a lot of shots on goal and I put more ball that led 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.309
 have so many shots on target then 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.269
 therein his study that this competition was lost this was it 

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.159
 strongest league 10 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.310
 and 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.570
 we are going to see how next time it will be the next nuclear energy well how can you 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.379
 call this 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.219
 I wanted to sing until next time this week at this unique and scuba diving 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.250
 it has more to offer and of course has it written out exactly 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.270
 that's that report 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.440
