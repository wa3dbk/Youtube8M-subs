00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
the hospital or was that actually just

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.620

the old man you know passing by I mean

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.670 
the old man you know passing by I mean
there's<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.870> lot<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.079> questions<00:04:11.440> right<00:04:11.650> there

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
there's a lot of questions right there

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.860 
there's a lot of questions right there
but<00:04:12.340> either<00:04:12.519> way<00:04:12.819> it's<00:04:13.120> still<00:04:13.359> funny<00:04:13.600> how<00:04:13.750> they

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
but either way it's still funny how they

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.420 
but either way it's still funny how they
added<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.319> little<00:04:14.500> section<00:04:14.859> into<00:04:15.340> this

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
added that little section into this

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.400 
added that little section into this
series<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:16.030> highly<00:04:16.510> doubt<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.169> scene

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
series I highly doubt that and scene

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.500 
series I highly doubt that and scene
will<00:04:17.590> play<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.769> vital<00:04:18.010> importance<00:04:18.790> later<00:04:18.970> on<00:04:19.180> I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
will play a vital importance later on I

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.610 
will play a vital importance later on I
think<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.810> was<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.019> meant<00:04:20.350> there

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
think that was just meant there

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.159 
think that was just meant there
for<00:04:20.799> comedy<00:04:21.190> gags<00:04:21.459> but<00:04:22.030> either<00:04:22.270> way<00:04:22.479> I<00:04:22.720> love<00:04:23.050> it

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
for comedy gags but either way I love it

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.659 
for comedy gags but either way I love it
a<00:04:23.260> lot<00:04:23.290> two<00:04:23.590> personality<00:04:24.130> characters<00:04:24.460> love

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669
