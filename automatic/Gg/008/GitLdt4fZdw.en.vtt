00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this green and we're gonna basically

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.520 
this green and we're gonna basically
stay<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.180> green<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> white

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
stay with green a little bit of white

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
stay with green a little bit of white
but<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.670> mentioned<00:01:47.729> before<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> did<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
but as I mentioned before what I did is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.480 
but as I mentioned before what I did is
I<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.759> really<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:51.470> base<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.740> lemon<00:01:53.340> leaves

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I put a really good base of lemon leaves

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.899 
I put a really good base of lemon leaves
here<00:01:54.439> ahead<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> time<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> save<00:01:56.399> us<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.700> little

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
here ahead of time to save us a little

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.690 
here ahead of time to save us a little
bit<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.299> time<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:58.619> may<00:01:59.009> want<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.340> take<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
bit of time you may want to take this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240 
bit of time you may want to take this
and<00:02:00.090> maybe<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.689> wooden<00:02:01.649> pick<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> back

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and maybe put a wooden pick on the back

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
and maybe put a wooden pick on the back
up<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> sits<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.270> picked<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.990> or

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
up so it sits really picked in there or

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.480 
up so it sits really picked in there or
you<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.500> kind<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.799> wedge<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.369> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you know kind of wedge it in so it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.910 
you know kind of wedge it in so it's
easy<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.030> driver<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.509> deliver<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
easy for your driver to deliver it you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.740 
easy for your driver to deliver it you
can<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.399> African<00:02:08.789> violets<00:02:09.239> structu

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
can do this with African violets structu

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
can do this with African violets structu
Karpis<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.800> know<00:02:10.890> any<00:02:11.069> indoor<00:02:11.489> plant<00:02:11.819> you

and then I'm gonna cross down in the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.220 
and then I'm gonna cross down in the
carnations<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> few<00:02:26.810> lemon<00:02:27.810> leaves<00:02:27.960> and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.620 
carnations with a few lemon leaves and
and<00:02:28.560> we'll<00:02:28.830> get<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.940> interesting<00:02:30.150> sort

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
and we'll get a really interesting sort

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
and we'll get a really interesting sort
of<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:31.100> pattern<00:02:32.100> here<00:02:33.020> again<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.050> really<00:02:34.440> can't

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
of a pattern here again I really can't

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
of a pattern here again I really can't
emphasize<00:02:34.740> enough<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:36.090> it's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
emphasize enough that I think it's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.450 
emphasize enough that I think it's
really<00:02:36.660> important<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.380> your<00:02:37.710> work<00:02:38.100> stand

of us think of these wreath forms as

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.900 
of us think of these wreath forms as
particularly<00:02:55.140> used<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:55.920> reason<00:02:56.400> there's<00:02:56.670> so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
particularly used on reason there's so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.210 
particularly used on reason there's so
many<00:02:57.030> other<00:02:57.270> uses<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.590> we<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:58.890> find

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
many other uses that that we can find

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.770 
many other uses that that we can find
for<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.550> they<00:02:59.790> don't<00:02:59.910> necessarily<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.660> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
for them they don't necessarily need to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.020 
for them they don't necessarily need to
be<00:03:00.900> upright<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.530> could<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.800> horizontal<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
be upright they could be horizontal you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.090 
be upright they could be horizontal you
could<00:03:03.180> make<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> really<00:03:03.750> nice<00:03:03.960> piece<00:03:04.710> for<00:03:04.950> an

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
could make a really nice piece for an

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.830 
could make a really nice piece for an
urn

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
urn

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.810
