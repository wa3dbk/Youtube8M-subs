your trucks so for starters this is all
the<00:01:03.939> colors<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.479> high-performance

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
the colors of the high-performance

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.649 
the colors of the high-performance
bushings<00:01:06.340> there's<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.970> little<00:01:07.180> bit<00:01:07.299> different

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
bushings there's a little bit different

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.999 
bushings there's a little bit different
things<00:01:07.840> there's<00:01:08.049> two<00:01:08.259> kinds<00:01:08.619> with<00:01:08.740> venom

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
things there's two kinds with venom

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.289 
things there's two kinds with venom
there's<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.340> high-performance<00:01:09.970> which<00:01:10.150> is

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
there's the high-performance which is

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:11.969 
there's the high-performance which is
these<00:01:10.450> below<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.020> they're<00:01:11.530> super<00:01:11.770> high

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
these below and they're super high

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.469 
these below and they're super high
rebound<00:01:12.369> which<00:01:12.520> has<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.729> different<00:01:13.090> color<00:01:13.270> in

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
rebound which has a different color in

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.330 
rebound which has a different color in
my<00:01:13.930> opinion<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.439> just<00:01:14.500> stick<00:01:14.979> with<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.220> high

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
my opinion I just stick with the high

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.920 
my opinion I just stick with the high
performance<00:01:15.880> they<00:01:16.240> seem<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.509> perform<00:01:16.659> a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
performance they seem to perform a

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.120 
performance they seem to perform a
little<00:01:17.079> bit<00:01:17.229> better<00:01:17.350> than<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.619> headset<00:01:17.920> jars

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
little bit better than the headset jars

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.550 
little bit better than the headset jars
and<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.670> SH<00:01:18.939> are<00:01:19.119> just<00:01:19.390> really<00:01:19.659> feel<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:20.200> little

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
and the SH are just really feel a little

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.380 
and the SH are just really feel a little
bit<00:01:20.680> harder<00:01:21.189> I<00:01:21.369> don't<00:01:21.880> really<00:01:22.000> think<00:01:22.090> there's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
bit harder I don't really think there's

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.359 
bit harder I don't really think there's
that<00:01:22.509> much<00:01:22.659> more<00:01:22.869> rebound<00:01:23.200> included<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.189> for

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
that much more rebound included so for

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.830 
that much more rebound included so for
starters<00:01:24.520> here's<00:01:24.939> all<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.270> durometer<00:01:25.630> 's<00:01:25.720> in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
starters here's all the durometer 's in

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.359 
starters here's all the durometer 's in
order<00:01:26.020> from<00:01:26.140> softest<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.740> hardest<00:01:27.040> we<00:01:27.250> have

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
order from softest to hardest we have

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.899 
order from softest to hardest we have
78a<00:01:28.360> which<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> dark<00:01:29.290> blue<00:01:29.470> we<00:01:30.159> have<00:01:30.249> 81a

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
78a which is a dark blue we have 81a

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.139 
78a which is a dark blue we have 81a
which<00:01:31.749> is<00:01:31.929> a<00:01:31.960> bright<00:01:32.289> orange<00:01:32.590> 85<00:01:33.549> eight<00:01:33.789> which

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
which is a bright orange 85 eight which

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.349 
which is a bright orange 85 eight which
is<00:01:34.179> like<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.689> fluorescent<00:01:35.049> yellow<00:01:35.969> 87a<00:01:36.969> which

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
is like a fluorescent yellow 87a which

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.169 
is like a fluorescent yellow 87a which
is<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.509> dark<00:01:37.780> purple<00:01:38.200> 90<00:01:39.039> a<00:01:39.069> which<00:01:39.819> is<00:01:39.999> like<00:01:40.149> a

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
is a dark purple 90 a which is like a

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.590 
is a dark purple 90 a which is like a
really<00:01:40.390> fluorescent<00:01:40.990> red<00:01:41.280> 93<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:42.939> green<00:01:43.359> and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
really fluorescent red 93 a is green and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.910 
really fluorescent red 93 a is green and
then<00:01:44.109> 97<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:45.189> pink<00:01:45.520> um<00:01:46.389> a<00:01:46.590> couple<00:01:47.590> things<00:01:47.710> I

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
then 97 a is pink um a couple things I

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.039 
then 97 a is pink um a couple things I
would<00:01:47.979> talk<00:01:48.189> about<00:01:48.219> with<00:01:48.639> bushings<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.270> these

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
would talk about with bushings is these

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.300 
would talk about with bushings is these
all<00:01:50.289> do<00:01:50.560> come<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.189> either<00:01:52.149> cone<00:01:53.069> barrel<00:01:54.069> or

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
all do come in either cone barrel or

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.279 
all do come in either cone barrel or
Eliminator<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.600> can<00:01:55.719> really<00:01:55.899> pick<00:01:56.079> and

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
Eliminator so you can really pick and

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.870 
Eliminator so you can really pick and
choose<00:01:56.469> there's<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.859> lot<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.249> different<00:01:57.579> setups

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
choose there's a lot of different setups

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.370 
choose there's a lot of different setups
you<00:01:57.969> could<00:01:58.149> have<00:01:58.299> if<00:01:58.719> you're<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.020> softer

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
you could have if you're on the softer

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.410 
you could have if you're on the softer
side<00:01:59.560> again<00:02:00.039> stick<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.490> softer<00:02:00.850> bushings<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
side again stick to softer bushings a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.749 
side again stick to softer bushings a
lot<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:01.990> people<00:02:02.229> think<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.829> harder<00:02:03.310> bushings

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
lot of people think that harder bushings

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.830 
lot of people think that harder bushings
are<00:02:03.850> going<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.030> make<00:02:04.179> you<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.299> lot<00:02:04.450> more<00:02:04.509> stable

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
are going to make you a lot more stable

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.020 
are going to make you a lot more stable
that's<00:02:05.499> not<00:02:05.679> necessarily<00:02:06.130> true<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.789> if<00:02:06.909> you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
that's not necessarily true and if you

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.160 
that's not necessarily true and if you
can't<00:02:07.240> compress<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.810> you're<00:02:07.929> going<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.080> be

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
can't compress it you're going to be

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.779 
can't compress it you're going to be
locked<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> center<00:02:08.950> point<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.399> that's<00:02:09.550> just

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
locked in a center point and that's just

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.100 
locked in a center point and that's just
going<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.970> give<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.240> kind<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.690> bad<00:02:10.810> speed

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
going to give you kind of bad speed

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.380 
going to give you kind of bad speed
wobbles<00:02:11.470> what<00:02:12.340> I'd<00:02:12.430> recommend<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.970> really

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
wobbles what I'd recommend is really

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.699 
wobbles what I'd recommend is really
just<00:02:13.660> trying<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.990> find<00:02:14.200> something<00:02:14.500> that's

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
just trying to find something that's

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.980 
front you have a little bit more turn in
the<00:02:54.550> front<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.450> going<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.630> be<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> good

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
the front this is going to be a good

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.290 
the front this is going to be a good
downhill<00:02:56.470> as<00:02:56.650> well<00:02:56.830> as<00:02:56.950> freeride<00:02:57.340> setup<00:02:57.670> so

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
downhill as well as freeride setup so

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.400 
downhill as well as freeride setup so
don't<00:02:58.480> worry<00:02:58.570> if<00:02:58.780> you're<00:02:58.930> worried<00:02:59.380> about

being<00:03:01.510> too<00:03:01.720> tight<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.440> won't<00:03:02.680> really<00:03:02.860> affect

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
being too tight that won't really affect

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.040 
being too tight that won't really affect
you<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.370> much<00:03:03.520> it's<00:03:04.330> more<00:03:04.600> for<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> whole

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
you that much it's more for the whole

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.980 
you that much it's more for the whole
stability<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.560> aspect<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.070> things<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.990> when

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
stability of aspect of things so when

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.030 
stability of aspect of things so when
you're<00:03:08.140> going<00:03:08.260> downhill

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
you're going downhill

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.740 
you're going downhill
you<00:03:09.760> want<00:03:09.940> most<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.300> your<00:03:10.420> weight<00:03:10.570> on<00:03:10.720> your

you want most of your weight on your

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.449 
you want most of your weight on your
front<00:03:10.990> bushings<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.860> allows<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.220> turn

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
front bushings so it allows you to turn

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.920 
front bushings so it allows you to turn
and<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.880> want<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.180> back<00:03:13.360> end<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.810> not

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and then you want the back end and not

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.780 
and then you want the back end and not
necessarily<00:03:14.350> feel<00:03:14.620> dead<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.490> want<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.700> to

I would do is lightly take some

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.770 
I would do is lightly take some
sandpaper<00:03:54.400> or<00:03:54.760> grip<00:03:54.940> tape<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.150> scratch<00:03:55.600> off

sandpaper or grip tape and scratch off

sandpaper or grip tape and scratch off
the<00:03:55.900> mold<00:03:56.080> release<00:03:56.350> because<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.910> kind

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the mold release because that can kind

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.150 
the mold release because that can kind
of<00:03:58.180> warp<00:03:58.630> inside<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.170> your<00:03:59.290> bushing<00:03:59.650> seat<00:03:59.890> when

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
of warp inside of your bushing seat when

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.009 
of warp inside of your bushing seat when
you<00:04:00.250> first<00:04:00.489> start<00:04:00.730> riding<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.660> can<00:04:01.870> lead

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
you first start riding and that can lead

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.290 
you first start riding and that can lead
to<00:04:02.050> not<00:04:02.320> fun<00:04:02.650> times<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.640> again<00:04:03.880> let's<00:04:04.090> go<00:04:04.209> ahead

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
to not fun times so again let's go ahead

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.420 
to not fun times so again let's go ahead
and<00:04:04.540> do<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.650> everything<00:04:06.220> should<00:04:06.370> work
