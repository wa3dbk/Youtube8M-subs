where<00:00:28.320> everything<00:00:28.830> goes<00:00:29.010> now<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.910> have

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
where everything goes now I do have

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.240 
where everything goes now I do have
videos<00:00:30.599> showing<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.140> linkage<00:00:31.439> configuration

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
videos showing the linkage configuration

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.979 
videos showing the linkage configuration
on<00:00:32.369> two<00:00:32.520> cups<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> engines<00:00:33.390> where<00:00:33.630> those<00:00:33.809> are

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
on two cups of engines where those are

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
on two cups of engines where those are
mostly<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.500> snow<00:00:34.800> blower<00:00:35.070> engines<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
mostly for snow blower engines so if you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000 
mostly for snow blower engines so if you
have<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> generator<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> setup<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.649> quite

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
have a generator the setup will be quite

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.920 
have a generator the setup will be quite
different<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> start<00:00:39.809> by

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
different so I'm going to start by

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.299 
different so I'm going to start by
showing<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> throttle<00:00:40.950> linkage

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
showing you the throttle linkage

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
showing you the throttle linkage
configuration<00:00:41.690> here's<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> throttle

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
configuration here's the throttle

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
configuration here's the throttle
butterfly<00:00:43.770> mechanism<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.059> linkage<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
butterfly mechanism and the linkage is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.299 
butterfly mechanism and the linkage is
connected<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.070> little

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
connected right into it with a little

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
connected right into it with a little
plastic<00:00:47.910> sleeve<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
plastic sleeve and from here that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
plastic sleeve and from here that
linkage<00:00:50.039> goes<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> governor<00:00:51.000> arm<00:00:51.210> right

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
linkage goes to the governor arm right

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.630 
linkage goes to the governor arm right
here<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
here and that's all there is the the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
here and that's all there is the the
throttle<00:00:54.090> linkage<00:00:54.449> configuration<00:00:55.250> now<00:00:56.250> if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
throttle linkage configuration now if

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.069 
throttle linkage configuration now if
you<00:00:56.489> did<00:00:56.699> need<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> adjust<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.449> engine<00:00:57.629> speed

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
you did need to adjust the engine speed

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.420 
you did need to adjust the engine speed
on<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> engine<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.039> start<00:00:59.309> by

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
on this engine you can start by

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.340 
on this engine you can start by
adjusting<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.329> torque<00:01:00.629> screw<00:01:00.989> over

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
adjusting the little torque screw over

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
adjusting the little torque screw over
here<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.059> need<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
here and to do that you will need a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.410 
here and to do that you will need a
number<00:01:03.420> t10<00:01:04.019> Torx<00:01:04.290> screw<00:01:04.650> driver<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
number t10 Torx screw driver and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
number t10 Torx screw driver and
sometimes<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.900> always<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> turn<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sometimes not always if you turn the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
sometimes not always if you turn the
screw<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> engine<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
screw and it will make the engine go a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
screw and it will make the engine go a
bit<00:01:10.020> faster<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> turn<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.490> will

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
bit faster if you turn it out it will

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
bit faster if you turn it out it will
make<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> bit<00:01:12.360> slower<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.619> don't

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
make it go a bit slower now I don't

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
make it go a bit slower now I don't
always<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.400> good<00:01:14.549> success<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:15.180> using<00:01:15.420> only

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
always have good success by using only

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.140 
always have good success by using only
this<00:01:16.080> screw<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.009> main<00:01:17.250> way<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> adjust<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this screw the main way to adjust the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
this screw the main way to adjust the
engine<00:01:18.509> speed<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.140> engine<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.890> by

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
engine speed on this engine is by

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
engine speed on this engine is by
adjusting<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> nut<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.080> holds

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
adjusting the nut right here that holds

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.399 
adjusting the nut right here that holds
the<00:01:22.619> arm<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.460> holds<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> spring<00:01:24.409> basically

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the arm that holds the spring basically

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
the arm that holds the spring basically
all<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> use<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> quarter<00:01:26.909> inch

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
all I use for this is a quarter inch

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.410 
all I use for this is a quarter inch
extension<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> 3/8<00:01:28.650> socket<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.210> use

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
extension with a 3/8 socket you can use

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
extension with a 3/8 socket you can use
a<00:01:30.450> ratchet<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.079> turn<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:31.950> but

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
a ratchet to turn it in or out but

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.920 
a ratchet to turn it in or out but
usually<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> nut<00:01:32.939> isn't<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.450> tight<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
usually the nut isn't that tight that I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.260 
usually the nut isn't that tight that I
can<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> by<00:01:34.530> hand<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:36.119> your

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can do it by hand if you want your

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
can do it by hand if you want your
engine<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> rev<00:01:36.900> faster<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> need<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> do

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
engine to rev faster what you need to do

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
engine to rev faster what you need to do
is<00:01:38.460> turn<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> will<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> put

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
is turn it in what that will do is put

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
is turn it in what that will do is put
extra<00:01:41.250> pressure<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.090> spring<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> extra

your engine Rev faster and it's just the
opposite<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> want<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.409> engine<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.070> read

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
do the opposite of tightening it it's
just<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> release<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> tension<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.579> the

that's<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.560> I've<00:02:07.710> adjusted<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.429> engine

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's how I've adjusted the engine

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.820 
that's how I've adjusted the engine

3,600<00:02:14.560> now<00:02:15.070> when<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.340> adjust<00:02:15.640> your<00:02:15.730> engines

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
3,600 now when you adjust your engines

3,600 now when you adjust your engines
being<00:02:16.390> make<00:02:16.630> sure<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:16.930> carburetor<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.530> clean

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
being make sure your carburetor is clean

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.710 
being make sure your carburetor is clean
because<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.460> not<00:02:18.730> your<00:02:19.000> engine<00:02:19.300> may<00:02:19.420> tend

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
because if it's not your engine may tend

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.200 
because if it's not your engine may tend
to<00:02:19.780> surge<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.560> down<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.610> very<00:02:21.940> hard

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
to surge up and down and it's very hard

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.480 
to surge up and down and it's very hard
to<00:02:22.300> set<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.900> RPMs<00:02:23.350> properly<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.220> case

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
to set the RPMs properly in that case

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.700 
to set the RPMs properly in that case
what<00:02:25.330> I'll<00:02:25.480> do<00:02:25.600> now<00:02:25.750> start<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> generator

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
what I'll do now start up the generator

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:47.970 
what I'll do now start up the generator
and<00:02:26.920> show<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.190> where<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.670> RPMs<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.270> set<00:02:28.510> up
