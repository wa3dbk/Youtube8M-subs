00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.760 

okay<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.430> anyway<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.000> card<00:01:12.299> has<00:01:12.479> been<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.930> for

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
okay so anyway this card has been in for

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
okay so anyway this card has been in for
a<00:01:13.799> total<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.100> twenty<00:01:14.490> minutes<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:15.320> on<00:01:17.299> 200

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
a total of twenty minutes now on 200

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.039 
a total of twenty minutes now on 200
Fahrenheit<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:21.060> thought<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> bit

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
Fahrenheit and I thought it was a bit

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.690 
Fahrenheit and I thought it was a bit
low<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.560> ran<00:01:22.829> upstairs<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.369> check<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
low so I ran upstairs and check the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.910 
low so I ran upstairs and check the
internet<00:01:26.700> video<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.450> yes<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.590> supposed<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
internet video and yes it's supposed to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
internet video and yes it's supposed to
be<00:01:29.039> at<00:01:29.130> 200<00:01:29.549> Celsius<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.899> popped<00:01:31.289> it<00:01:31.470> in

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
be at 200 Celsius so I popped it in

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.789 
be at 200 Celsius so I popped it in
again<00:01:32.119> at<00:01:33.119> four<00:01:33.539> hundred<00:01:33.720> Fahrenheit<00:01:34.350> which

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
again at four hundred Fahrenheit which

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.380 
again at four hundred Fahrenheit which
is<00:01:35.009> 200<00:01:35.460> Celsius<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:38.159> I'm<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.789> wait

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
is 200 Celsius so I'm just going to wait

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.190 
is 200 Celsius so I'm just going to wait
for<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.630> bad<00:01:39.840> boy<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> cool<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:42.200> we're
