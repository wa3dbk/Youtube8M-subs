you will replace either the whole
assembly<00:06:50.830> or<00:06:51.010> if<00:06:51.700> your<00:06:51.910> light<00:06:52.660> balls<00:06:52.930> are<00:06:53.050> out

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
assembly or if your light balls are out

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.190 
assembly or if your light balls are out
this<00:06:53.950> would<00:06:54.100> be<00:06:54.190> a<00:06:54.220> good<00:06:54.400> time<00:06:54.580> to<00:06:55.050> this<00:06:56.050> is<00:06:56.110> a

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
this would be a good time to this is a

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.280 
this would be a good time to this is a
driver<00:06:56.500> side<00:06:56.740> right<00:06:56.920> there<00:06:57.900> okay<00:06:58.900> now<00:06:59.020> we<00:06:59.080> get

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
driver side right there okay now we get

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.780 
driver side right there okay now we get
to<00:06:59.470> the<00:06:59.560> actual<00:06:59.830> actuator<00:07:00.990> actual<00:07:02.020> actuator
