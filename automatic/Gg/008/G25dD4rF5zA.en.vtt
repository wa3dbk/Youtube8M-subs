good afternoon all welcome to another

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.640 
good afternoon all welcome to another
video<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> scout<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.560> not

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
video on the scout you know it's not

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
video on the scout you know it's not
flying<00:00:16.949> video<00:00:17.220> today<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:18.300> another<00:00:20.869> sort<00:00:21.869> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
flying video today it's another sort of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.310 
flying video today it's another sort of
a<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> how-to<00:00:23.180> video<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:25.199> off

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
a bit of a how-to video and it going off

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.710 
a bit of a how-to video and it going off
the<00:00:25.470> back<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.220> recent<00:00:26.730> video<00:00:26.880> which<00:00:27.539> I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the back of a recent video which I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.600 
the back of a recent video which I
posted<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.439> battery<00:00:29.449> in<00:00:30.449> accuracy<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.270 

in<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.989> short<00:00:37.290> terms<00:00:37.590> I'll<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.190> as

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
in in in short terms I'll make it as

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.180 
in in in short terms I'll make it as
brief<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.000> possible<00:00:39.920> there<00:00:40.920> appears<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
brief as possible there appears to be a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
brief as possible there appears to be a
slight<00:00:44.190> issue<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.620> voltage<00:00:46.620> reading

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
slight issue with the voltage reading

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
slight issue with the voltage reading
from<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> scout<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.390> think<00:00:48.629> I've<00:00:48.780> cured

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
from the scout and I think I've cured

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.139 
from the scout and I think I've cured
what<00:00:50.219> potentially<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> problem<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:53.149> if

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
what potentially is the problem so if

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.459 
what potentially is the problem so if
you<00:00:54.239> follow<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.719> instructions<00:00:55.610> hopefully

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
you follow these instructions hopefully

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.959 
you follow these instructions hopefully
you'll<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.500> able<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.100> potentially<00:00:59.609> fix<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you'll be able to potentially fix the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
you'll be able to potentially fix the
problem<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.379> did<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.920> was

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
problem and not do what I did which was

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.690 
problem and not do what I did which was
basically<00:01:02.969> fly<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.290> scout<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> much<00:01:05.369> lower

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
basically fly the scout to a much lower

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390 
basically fly the scout to a much lower
voltage<00:01:06.290> I've<00:01:07.290> pretty<00:01:07.530> much<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.920> got<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.220> back

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
voltage I've pretty much now got it back

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.539 
voltage I've pretty much now got it back
to<00:01:08.640> showing<00:01:08.880> 25<00:01:09.810> volts<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> start<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
to showing 25 volts at the start of the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.039 
to showing 25 volts at the start of the
flight<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.630> yeah<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.750> you're<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.990> to

you how to do it so first things first
we<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.380> load<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.399> mission<00:01:53.729> planner<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
we need to load a mission planner and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
we need to load a mission planner and
there's<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.710> link<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> description<00:01:56.579> below

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
there's a link in the description below

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.990 
there's a link in the description below
on<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> download<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.460> how<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> download

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
it so if we load up permission planner

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.730 
it so if we load up permission planner
really<00:02:06.750> mind<00:02:06.930> you've<00:02:07.200> already<00:02:07.350> thought<00:02:07.590> your

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
really mind you've already thought your

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.919 
really mind you've already thought your
scalp<00:02:09.110> connected

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
scalp connected

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.580 
scalp connected
and<00:02:12.090> we're<00:02:13.090> pretty<00:02:13.420> much<00:02:13.660> ready<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.290> go

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and we're pretty much ready to go

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.020 
and we're pretty much ready to go
and<00:02:15.209> hopefully<00:02:16.209> you'll<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.870> bit<00:02:17.260> up<00:02:17.440> on

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
and hopefully you'll be a bit up on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.880 
and hopefully you'll be a bit up on
connecting<00:02:19.030> your<00:02:19.239> scalp<00:02:19.750> via<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.440> USB<00:02:20.709> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
connecting your scalp via the USB and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.420 
connecting your scalp via the USB and
everything<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.400> that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
everything like that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.759 
everything like that
okay<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.170> loads<00:02:26.549> your<00:02:27.549> gate<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:29.560> at

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
okay so as this loads your gate up at

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.320 
okay so as this loads your gate up at
the<00:02:29.830> top<00:02:30.040> right<00:02:30.220> hand<00:02:30.400> corner<00:02:30.519> here<00:02:30.970> we<00:02:31.180> need

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
the top right hand corner here we need

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.030 
the top right hand corner here we need
to<00:02:31.390> connect<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.580> scalp<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:35.110> software

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.449 

so<00:02:39.040> that's<00:02:39.129> downloading<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
so that's downloading all the

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.729 
so that's downloading all the
information<00:02:42.459> from<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.420> scalp<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
information from the scalp all the

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.309 
information from the scalp all the
settings<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:45.579> got<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.450> there<00:02:47.019> at<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
settings that it's got on there at the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:55.830 
settings that it's got on there at the
moment<00:02:52.799> okay<00:02:53.799> which<00:02:54.010> it's<00:02:54.220> done<00:02:54.370> now<00:02:55.299> if<00:02:55.569> we<00:02:55.690> go

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
moment okay which it's done now if we go

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.780 
moment okay which it's done now if we go
into<00:02:56.430> configuration<00:02:58.290> full<00:02:59.290> parameter<00:03:00.010> list

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
is the figure that you need five point

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.660 
is the figure that you need five point
two<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.319> three<00:03:21.310> five<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:22.209> seven<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:24.430> it's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
two to three five to seven if it's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.129 
two to three five to seven if it's
showing<00:03:24.880> anything<00:03:25.450> else<00:03:25.690> other<00:03:25.840> than<00:03:25.959> that

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
showing anything else other than that

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.440 
showing anything else other than that
you<00:03:26.590> pretend<00:03:27.220> might<00:03:27.639> have<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:27.880> slight<00:03:28.239> issue

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
you pretend might have a slight issue

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.050 
you pretend might have a slight issue
with<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.930> reading<00:03:29.769> lock<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.220> was<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:33.730> will

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
with the reading lock I was so you will

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.210 
with the reading lock I was so you will
double<00:03:34.510> click<00:03:34.540> into<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.500> can

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
double click into that and you can

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.349 
double click into that and you can
literally<00:03:36.579> type<00:03:36.819> what<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.269> want<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:38.680> there<00:03:39.359> or

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
in this case you shouldn't 5.2 two three

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.870 
in this case you shouldn't 5.2 two three
five<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:44.200> seven<00:03:45.599> click<00:03:46.599> write<00:03:47.430> parameters<00:03:48.430> and

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
five to seven click write parameters and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.870 
five to seven click write parameters and
that<00:03:49.120> will<00:03:49.239> write<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.870> parameter<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:51.099> this

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
that will write the parameter to this

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.809 
that will write the parameter to this
count<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.769> then<00:03:53.889> all<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.130> do<00:03:54.280> is<00:03:54.489> just

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
count and then all you do is just

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.220 
count and then all you do is just
disconnect<00:03:55.359> it<00:03:55.569> that's<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.669> now<00:03:57.669> hopefully<00:03:58.230> if

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
disconnect it that's it now hopefully if

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.349 
disconnect it that's it now hopefully if
it's<00:03:59.560> like<00:03:59.769> mine<00:04:00.040> that<00:04:01.000> would<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.329> changed

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
it's like mine that would have changed

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.789 
it's like mine that would have changed
it<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:04.329> now<00:04:04.660> I'm<00:04:04.780> getting<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.169> full<00:04:05.410> twenty

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
it and now I'm getting a full twenty

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.059 
it and now I'm getting a full twenty
five<00:04:06.010> volts<00:04:06.549> at<00:04:07.389> the<00:04:07.630> start<00:04:07.989> other<00:04:08.889> that's

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
five volts at the start other that's

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.089 
five volts at the start other that's
displayed<00:04:09.489> on<00:04:09.639> my<00:04:09.760> transmitter<00:04:10.889> so<00:04:11.889> that's

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
displayed on my transmitter so that's

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.009 
displayed on my transmitter so that's
what<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.340> need<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.609> look<00:04:12.760> for<00:04:14.250> that's<00:04:15.250> the
