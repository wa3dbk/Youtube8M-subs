00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
iPod does not have a passcode on it and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.140 
iPod does not have a passcode on it and
then<00:01:12.650> you're<00:01:13.160> just<00:01:13.250> going<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.820> click<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
then you're just going to click the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.390 
then you're just going to click the
jailbreak<00:01:14.570> button<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.170> let<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.070> sit<00:01:16.370> for

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
jailbreak button and let it sit for

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.130 
jailbreak button and let it sit for
about<00:01:16.640> 10<00:01:17.000> minutes<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.900> probably

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
about 10 minutes and this is probably

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.350 
about 10 minutes and this is probably
the<00:01:18.290> longest<00:01:18.500> part<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.360> jailbreak

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
the longest part of the jailbreak

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.660 
the longest part of the jailbreak
process<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:21.350> once<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.890> done<00:01:21.920> it's<00:01:22.250> very

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
process but once this is done it's very

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.380 
process but once this is done it's very
it's<00:01:22.850> fairly<00:01:23.240> easy<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.960> quick

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.649 

so<00:01:27.229> now<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.740> see<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.520> asking<00:01:28.880> us<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.390> go

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
so now you see that it's asking us to go

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.330 
so now you see that it's asking us to go
on<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.960> our<00:01:30.050> device<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.650> click<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.860> jailbreak

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.340 
on to our device and click the jailbreak
icon<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.690> make<00:01:32.960> sure<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.170> only

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350

icon so do this and make sure you only
click<00:01:33.620> it<00:01:33.830> once<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:34.820> otherwise<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.390> won't

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
click it once now otherwise it won't

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.230 
click it once now otherwise it won't
work

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
work

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.990 
work
then<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.439> are<00:01:38.530> going<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.740> see<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.700> on<00:01:39.880> the
