to<00:06:41.690> spend<00:06:42.080> that<00:06:42.200> much<00:06:42.380> when<00:06:42.860> you<00:06:42.980> can<00:06:43.160> make<00:06:43.370> it

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
to spend that much when you can make it

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.290 
to spend that much when you can make it
yourself<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:45.080> what<00:06:45.230> I<00:06:45.260> did<00:06:45.590> was<00:06:45.920> basically

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
yourself and what I did was basically

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.650 
yourself and what I did was basically
get<00:06:47.300> an<00:06:47.480> old<00:06:47.780> bra<00:06:48.170> snip<00:06:49.130> off<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.850> size<00:06:50.330> this

back and then keep the straps on

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.130 
back and then keep the straps on
basically<00:06:58.520> you<00:06:58.910> just<00:06:59.090> sew<00:06:59.300> it<00:06:59.330> right<00:06:59.480> onto<00:06:59.960> the
