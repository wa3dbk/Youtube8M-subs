00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.580
 hello classmates good this little video 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.200
 fast let's do tethered jailbreak 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.619
 or an iphone 4 in the 601 version 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:23.320
 For this we will use networks no 09 15 20 3 and 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.970
 the signature 60 of the iphone 460 if for 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.400
 cheat return since this recent 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.900
 recession by not supporting a 601 version 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.970
 that we have installed on the iphone 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.290
 Then the first thing is to cheat him 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.270
 we'll go to extras select ipsw and here 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.750
 we will load the firmware 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.940
 we have 60 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.210
 we do not load correctly identify it 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.230
 and we continue good we will open towards 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.710
 back we will use jailbreak we hope that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.350
 the bar is loaded 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 the options will appear we let be 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.199
 so diaz has marked one click next 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 now he asks us to turn off the iphone 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.070
 we turn off 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 we go down and we'll have to do the df 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.870
 We press nest and prepare ourselves with the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.630
 buttons 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.390
 we use the two buttons and when the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.830
 central counter reaches zero drop the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.220
 turn on button and we will continue alone 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.220
 with home 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.590
 now we let go and continue 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.789
 with background 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.350
 once the bar appears 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:40.470
 progress we can release together 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.470
 let go with and stop continuing 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.040
 now the process will start on the own 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.600
 iphone this will take a couple of minutes and 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.909
 once this is over we will have to 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.439
 do the second part is the george 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.329
 bot is the message that appears here 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.149
 up now in recess 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.679
 in which indicates that this jailbreak is 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.450
 tethered so we'll have to do 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.569
 a jackpot for everything to work 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.569
 correctly 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.800
 actually before the iphone will boot 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.800
 normal 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.980
 and when when we are going to make the dialogue 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:26.090
 which is when will start already granted 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.090
 operative of 55 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.120
 always remember that before you do 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.040
 because we have done great jailbreak or 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.920
 before doing jazz bots always always 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.579
 always charge at 60 in selective extras 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.939
 about what we just did before and 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.939
 before them 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.890
 to the face 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.790
 while we start we can go 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:22.530
 preparing the jazz board we can go 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:28.100
 back we can go back select and psv 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.100
 we reload 60 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.830
 we charge it we recognize it and already 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.830
 we can do jazz bots once 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.500
 we are a little bit is a beginning 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.620
 to work 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.050
 we enter we see that everything remains the same 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.060
 laziness or nothing then now 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.200
 we do the rightful remember that we have already 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.700
 charged 60 again 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.700
 He asks us to end up again 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.370
 we pay 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.860
 the button was activated we pressed it 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:15.919
 we prepare for the df 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.919
 the buttons are numbered central 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.450
 that's it 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.630
 one we let go we continue with 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.630
 home 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.960
 let go were also 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.960
 and now the pineapple will appear 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.090
 pineapple 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.100
 We will not get there 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.620
 ok I do not know anymore 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.620
 take charge if now we enter 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:27.930
 already appears 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:33.080
 Silvia 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.750
 and if we press in the silence 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.550
 Well that's all ok and remember very 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.069
 important every time I make the 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:45.229
 wall of the whole run out of battery or 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:47.000
 was or restart load on networks now it's 60 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.550
 and you make a jazz voice that is to say the other 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.479
 part that we have done come a greeting and 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.479
