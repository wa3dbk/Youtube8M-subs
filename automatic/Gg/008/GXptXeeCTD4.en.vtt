00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
things that I like to think of when I'm

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.040 
things that I like to think of when I'm
skiing<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.580> bumps<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.000> not<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:32.870> much<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
skiing the bumps is not so much the

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.229 
skiing the bumps is not so much the
technical<00:00:33.590> side<00:00:33.950> of<00:00:34.010> skiing<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.670> little<00:00:35.120> bit

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
technical side of skiing a little bit

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.420 
technical side of skiing a little bit
more<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.540> tactical<00:00:36.200> side<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.620> skiing<00:00:36.980> then

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
more the tactical side of skiing then

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.200 
more the tactical side of skiing then
I'm<00:00:37.489> going<00:00:37.610> to<00:00:37.640> show<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:37.970> few<00:00:38.120> little

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
I'm going to show you a few little

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.210 
I'm going to show you a few little
pointers<00:00:38.480> here<00:00:38.840> today<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:39.710> might<00:00:39.890> help<00:00:40.040> you

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
pointers here today that might help you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.040 
pointers here today that might help you
improve<00:00:40.520> your<00:00:40.580> bump<00:00:40.879> skiing<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:41.629> come<00:00:41.750> on<00:00:41.870> with

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
improve your bump skiing so come on with

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
improve your bump skiing so come on with
me<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.230> we'll<00:00:42.410> give<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.680> shot<00:00:42.710> here<00:00:43.100> we<00:00:43.190> go

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
me and we'll give it a shot here we go

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.920 
me and we'll give it a shot here we go
so<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.100> think<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.520> tactical<00:00:47.090> elements<00:00:47.540> of<00:00:47.660> bump

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
so I think the tactical elements of bump

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.400 
so I think the tactical elements of bump
skiing<00:00:48.320> well<00:00:49.010> their<00:00:49.190> speed<00:00:49.580> for<00:00:50.120> sure<00:00:50.410> you

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
skiing well their speed for sure you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.990 
skiing well their speed for sure you
want<00:00:51.560> to<00:00:51.590> be<00:00:51.710> able<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:51.920> control<00:00:52.310> that<00:00:52.610> then

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
want to be able to control that then

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.930 
want to be able to control that then
there's<00:00:53.239> turn<00:00:53.570> shape<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.399> then<00:00:55.399> there's<00:00:55.610> line

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
there's turn shape and then there's line

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.260 
there's turn shape and then there's line
those<00:00:56.540> are<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.750> three<00:00:56.960> tactics<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.680> think<00:00:58.239> so<00:00:59.239> I

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
those are the three tactics I think so I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.060 
those are the three tactics I think so I
want<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.510> get<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> good<00:00:59.870> handle<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.500> those<00:01:00.680> three

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
want to get a good handle on those three

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.340 
want to get a good handle on those three
tactics<00:01:01.660> otherwise<00:01:02.660> things<00:01:02.989> can<00:01:03.140> get<00:01:03.290> a

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
tactics otherwise things can get a

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.040 
tactics otherwise things can get a
little<00:01:03.559> bit<00:01:03.680> hectic<00:01:03.890> here<00:01:04.369> in<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.640> bumps<00:01:05.050> you

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
little bit hectic here in the bumps you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.870 
little bit hectic here in the bumps you
know<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.170> lot<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.410> times<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.950> terrain<00:01:07.280> can<00:01:07.310> toss

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
know a lot of times the terrain can toss

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.420 
know a lot of times the terrain can toss
you<00:01:08.149> around<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.800> terrain<00:01:10.009> sort<00:01:10.340> of

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
you around and the terrain sort of

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.240 
you around and the terrain sort of
dictates<00:01:10.910> where<00:01:11.540> you<00:01:11.750> end<00:01:11.930> up<00:01:12.170> if<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.100> can

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
dictates where you end up if you can

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.030 
dictates where you end up if you can
manage<00:01:13.460> line<00:01:13.940> speed<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.170> turn<00:01:15.380> shape<00:01:15.710> you're

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
manage line speed and turn shape you're

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.560 
manage line speed and turn shape you're
all<00:01:16.160> good<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.440> manage<00:01:18.770> my<00:01:19.009> line<00:01:19.570> well

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
all good so if I can manage my line well

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.359 
all good so if I can manage my line well
that's<00:01:20.750> gonna<00:01:20.899> help<00:01:21.110> me<00:01:21.289> control<00:01:21.649> my<00:01:21.770> speed

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
that's gonna help me control my speed

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.780 
that's gonna help me control my speed
and<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.479> control<00:01:23.840> both<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.170> those<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.950> need<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
and to control both of those I need to

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.410 
and to control both of those I need to
think<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.180> my<00:01:26.360> turn<00:01:26.720> shape<00:01:27.320> itself<00:01:28.420> so

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
think of my turn shape itself so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.359 
think of my turn shape itself so
basically<00:01:29.780> what<00:01:30.049> I<00:01:30.080> mean<00:01:30.320> by<00:01:30.470> turn<00:01:30.710> shape<00:01:31.100> is

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
basically what I mean by turn shape is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.060 
basically what I mean by turn shape is
how<00:01:31.580> round<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.930> your<00:01:33.380> turn<00:01:33.619> that's<00:01:33.890> what's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
gonna help dictate your speed it's also

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.289 
gonna help dictate your speed it's also
gonna<00:01:36.380> help<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:36.770> choose<00:01:37.010> your<00:01:37.280> line<00:01:37.490> come<00:01:38.210> on

mean so check this out take the
opportunity<00:01:42.470> these<00:01:42.560> flats<00:01:43.040> before<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.700> get

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
opportunity these flats before I get

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.440 
opportunity these flats before I get
into<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.360> bumps<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.409> set<00:01:45.710> my<00:01:45.950> turn<00:01:46.280> shape<00:01:46.670> my

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
into the bumps to set my turn shape my

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870 
into the bumps to set my turn shape my
speed<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.290> my<00:01:48.350> line<00:01:49.189> I'm<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:49.700> going<00:01:49.820> to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
speed and my line I'm just going to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.300 
speed and my line I'm just going to
carry<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.479> all<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:50.990> way<00:01:51.409> into<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.710> boxes<00:01:52.159> if

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
carry that all the way into the boxes if

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.350 
carry that all the way into the boxes if
they're<00:01:52.490> not<00:01:52.610> even<00:01:52.939> here

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.710 

so<00:01:55.930> keep<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.200> round<00:01:56.710> turn<00:01:57.160> shape<00:01:57.490> going<00:01:57.790> that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
so keep that round turn shape going that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.660
