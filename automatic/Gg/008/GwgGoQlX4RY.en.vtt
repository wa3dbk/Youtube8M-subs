 I thought that I'm not going to paradise 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.430

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.370
 I force myself 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 it's the casting 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.080
 i 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.140
 It looks awesome 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.800
 hey I did the casting and they approved me immediately but you know that I 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.920
 I started on first impact 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.740
 It's me 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.380
 It was the first ipad where I started 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.670
 percent for a client or almost a good year in a year going to some in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.140
 a first impact and that's when 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 percent 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.640
 what I miss a division 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.760
 they realize that my style is 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.550
 adapts more to span they wanted to steal 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.370
 for first impact then 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.690
 he asks me for a test for the news 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.820

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.450
 and he immediately suggested a series of history that I could 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.370
 make him 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.370

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.909
 isabel calero the ship 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.969
 it's a question that you always ask one but you know what in the 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.349
 that was spent a lot in this country was so much money the money ran out 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.140
 and above all of a lot of commitment that has family that must up to here that 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.109
 be relevant 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.179
 try to walk 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.329
 as your own society demands it because a society that demands a lot from you 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.509
 because it does not give you the same amount 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.069
 it's not that you earn well but you know what 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.419
 one has to see also that it is possible to do something else and not everything 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.729
 prospered but to be able to make up for what neither did he pay all the money from 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.219
 world and I had wind 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.119
 because rock dollar there was no color sk tapatía inc 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.569

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.969
 I owe a lot to the one who is also the hotel manager 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.969
 He gave me much of my career today by Emilio Herasme Peña 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:35.139
 that great journalist who was the one who brought me the news 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.149
 at that time, then to all those people who had the newspaper 'la la 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.169
 riot at that time that I was a little boy practically an apprentice 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.599
 that I was running errands, you see, you understand 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.669
 to be able to fall in grace and that I know and help me 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.709
 Well I appreciate it very much not only that I appreciate 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.339
 clear because they were practically what those who mediated Asia acea perhaps 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.729
 percent the place that I am now that has not arrived yet I'm not in the 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:59.799
 path 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.409
 clear that although 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.159
 I have married 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.979

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.449
 in no meat and oil 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.319
 I have a vehicle or veto for me to be able to 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.919
 but not walking I would walk through the villages because I'm from the capital 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.409
 Obviously I, of course, you become so much I bought it and 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.279
 good of normality but there is oil 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.099
 but I work 14 15 hours 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.159
 and 13 hours every day 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.159
 It is assumed that people who work so much have to be comfortable 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.999
 laredo for you already in is 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.190

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.560

 from this country your conscience 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.069
 see here the republic oblige many good journalists a very question 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.800
 wide and they fine me that they dared well because every journalist in my country a 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.069
 my friend all

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.620
 excellent reporter carlos julio féliz 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.700
 percent for me is another television reporter one of the best 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.409
 Napoleon of the Cross 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.139

 it seems to me that we are better television reporter right now who know 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.520
 control and something else 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.729

 very good journalists in the Dominican Republic 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.499
 different from other countries 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.309
 there are many channels but there is not so much good journalist because here 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.870
 the journalist worried about learning 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.719
 he feels comfortable that in commission 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:45.879
 wonderfully 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.879
 Wonderfully, give me that I got color vision in the government

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.529
 I have managed to keep quiet here 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:58.490
 percent 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.659
 I'm not leaving here until they vote for me 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.330

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.039
 efe 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.180

 first you have to be a good journalist 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.520
 and he wins well that he sinned in series because he has the war of the ballots and if 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.770
 you are a journalist who works well then two channels bogged down on you 

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:27.059
 that you have to read a lot of literature many books 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.630

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:38.369
 the vote to stage fright and it is always the public arena to handle it 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:39.139
 Wolves
