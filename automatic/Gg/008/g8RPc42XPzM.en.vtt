00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.650
 I want you in this short film 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.850
 show how to make a hole in the jeans 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.590
 mostly at knee level like that 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.740
 can repair without the teams 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.320
 further damaged we have one 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.660
 mending jeans we have 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.450
 in the dark color in the bright color 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.509
 in this pants we choose the bright 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.770
 colour 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.300
 the practical thing about this patch is 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.270
 that you have a camp at the bottom 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.720
 have adhesive situation that is that this 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 look at the trousers being ironed on 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.610
 can 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.410
 where is actually to recommend around 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.700
 They still continue to fix there 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.880
 Otherwise, at the laundry 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.230
 after several washes, let go of what 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.180
 we can do this too 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.460
 Stains from the inside on the trousers 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.920
 Fix it so that the hole still 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.520
 but the pants are not visible 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.320
 break further can turn for it 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.189
 I have the pants around then I have this here 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.719
 hole on knees 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.880
 I'll take the mend and then I'll put it 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:21.939
 with the adhesive side on the pants then 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.679
 he still sticks to the fabric and fixes 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.759
 So also the fabric so that is 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.149
 It also can not continue 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.149
 tear 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.579
 add the but without steam 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.979
 otherwise you will not stick and then 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.270
 I'll do it later with the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.270
 Attach the sewing machine 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.390
 I put the patch now first 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:56.560
 stuck what do I do with transverse 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.420
 needles when I sit that mass 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.829
 then I can talk about it too 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.829
 over it take away 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.810
 I pinned that I could 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.750
 pin as a landmark 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.730
 if I fix the mend 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.910
 near you best take that too 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.440
 the right side fixed as a sting of 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.020
 the sewing machine from the right actually 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.720
 always looks better than the left 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.620
 So from the bottom around that clearly 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.500
 close 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.840
 I'm using a thread around it now 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.240
 arrest 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.390
 with big stitches and then I can do that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.950
 to use as an orientation where I then 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.950
 wants to take with the sewing machine 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.820
 Now I'm stuck in euros around 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:03.470
 stapled then I can not do it now 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.470
 also remove the pins again 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.590
 and then I turn the pants and then 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.100
 neighborhood 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:19.860
 the pants from the other side around that 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.720
 Push the leg of the leg over the sewing machine 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.760
 you definitely need to be able to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:31.080
 here for a machine with a free one 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.090
 poor then i see that about it only is it 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.430
 not possible now at once 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.230
 a patch all around 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.200
 to arrest that means I show that 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.710
 a two phases 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.890
 I start on one side of the 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.890
 sew 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.200
 Do not forget the distance is close 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.200
 one side 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.450
 here i take a round corner you too 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:13.579
 can make is square through the corner 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:13.579
 Who then as far turn they come 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.750
 if you make sure that's clear 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:30.050
 piece of raisin smooth and sewing machine 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:38.629
 I'm not so far so far come 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:41.259
 I shall then that in phases of 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.259
 them 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.909
 then we have the first one 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.029
 half of the separately they mend 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:59.879
 pleasantly sewn the sewing machine to the 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.400
 rose under the sewing machine I got out 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.469
 now sewn from below from the sound 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.659
 I then had the pants over the 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.789
 I pushed the sewing machine now 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:12.439
 that from the top that means I can do so 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.439
 to take the other direction because 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.240
 I start back where I am right now 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:32.100
 I stopped just before sewing 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:34.320
 the thread again and take now until 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.750
 Beginning 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.380
 I have the peace now fixed on the 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.630
 trousers 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.830
 the hole is still visible that 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.770
 also is not wrong because it is in 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.370
 moment but a fashionable item is 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.630
 the pants will not tear further 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:54.210
 fabric is fixed and even through 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:56.460
 The glue from the patch supplies that 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.100
 the fabric is not so fast anymore 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:05.910
 can break 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:07.900
 even though I'm threading it out and stuff 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.730
 is my jeans 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.900
 so can not fix it again 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.900
 carry a lot of fun
