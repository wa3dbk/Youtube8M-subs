00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
why you didn't like the frames with

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600 
why you didn't like the frames with
Kailen<00:00:40.050> them<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.160> frames<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.520> really

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
Kailen them the the frames are really

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.470 
Kailen them the the frames are really
good<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.180> more<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> an<00:00:42.660> anti<00:00:42.930> rocker<00:00:43.140> frame

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480

good it's more of an anti rocker frame
MIT<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.500> works<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:46.860> people

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
yeah but I'm gonna rock a little smaller

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.130 
yeah but I'm gonna rock a little smaller
frame<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.760> write<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.030> flat<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.600> should

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
frame and then write it flat so should

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.610 
frame and then write it flat so should
be<00:00:52.170> fine

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
be fine

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.660

like which frame you're gonna put on um

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
like which frame you're gonna put on um
probably<00:00:56.670> create<00:00:59.000> create<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> Celtic<00:01:00.750> yeah

and what the sudden like that
what<00:01:04.199> goes<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.619> mind<00:01:04.739> when<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
what goes through your mind when you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
what goes through your mind when you
make<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> decision<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.619> what<00:01:07.619> frame<00:01:07.890> goes

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
make up the decision of what frame goes

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
make up the decision of what frame goes
on<00:01:08.310> those<00:01:08.460> skates<00:01:08.760> oh<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.750> gotta<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.080> good

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

with the skate you know so I'm thinking
with<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.210> guy<00:01:12.360> probably<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> dark<00:01:13.170> grey

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
a lot of carbon skates out there the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
a lot of carbon skates out there the
liner<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> built-in<00:01:39.780> except<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.619> really

padding I can actually lean forward on

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.310 
padding I can actually lean forward on
gaps<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.829> cool<00:01:47.840> why<00:01:48.840> cuz<00:01:49.170> they

gaps now so that's cool why cuz they
don't

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
don't

getting<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.630> those<00:02:15.870> um<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.740> got<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> nine<00:02:17.280> us<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
getting in those um I got a nine us and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.040 
getting in those um I got a nine us and
II<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.450> probably<00:02:18.600> fit<00:02:18.900> an

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
II so I can probably fit an

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.380 
II so I can probably fit an
eight-and-a-half<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.150> give

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
eight-and-a-half but I'm just gonna give

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.970 
eight-and-a-half but I'm just gonna give
my<00:02:21.540> feet<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.500> break

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
my feet a little break

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
my feet a little break
mm-hm<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.090> toes<00:02:24.300> are<00:02:24.540> kind<00:02:24.720> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
mm-hm because my toes are kind of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.270 
mm-hm because my toes are kind of
beat-up<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> my<00:02:25.440> heels<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.100> little

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
can pull them nice and tight nice

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.240 
can pull them nice and tight nice
control<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.080> nice<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
control this is really nice here it's a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.100 
control this is really nice here it's a
nice<00:02:47.400> wide<00:02:47.610> strap<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.540> buckle<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.930> cool

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
nice wide strap and the buckle is cool

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.780 
nice wide strap and the buckle is cool
because<00:02:49.320> then<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:50.010> never<00:02:50.220> comes<00:02:50.490> out<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
because then this never comes out and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.500 
because then this never comes out and
your<00:02:51.210> buckle<00:02:51.480> won't<00:02:51.630> crack<00:02:51.780> off<00:02:53.150> yeah<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.360> this

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
your buckle won't crack off yeah so this

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.050 
your buckle won't crack off yeah so this
area<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.020> skate<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.350> probably<00:02:55.620> what<00:02:55.770> I'm<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
area the skate is probably what I'm the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.700 
area the skate is probably what I'm the
most<00:02:57.090> stoked<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.690> anything<00:02:58.530> that<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:01.200> don't

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
most stoked on anything that you don't

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.200 
most stoked on anything that you don't
like<00:03:01.860> about<00:03:02.100> them<00:03:02.430> where<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.700> prefer<00:03:03.090> in

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
like about them where you prefer in

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.490 
like about them where you prefer in
other<00:03:03.420> skates<00:03:03.840> uh<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.140> could<00:03:07.320> use<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
other skates uh I think this could use a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.780 
other skates uh I think this could use a
little<00:03:07.650> bit<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.920> protection<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.460> they<00:03:08.610> kind

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
little bit of protection but they kind

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.740 
little bit of protection but they kind
of<00:03:08.820> figure<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.210> out<00:03:09.330> with<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.540> other

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of figure that out with the other

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.030 
of figure that out with the other
misse-x<00:03:10.200> skates<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.680> had<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:10.980> a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
misse-x skates they had of like a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.010 
misse-x skates they had of like a
plastic<00:03:11.430> guard<00:03:11.670> here<00:03:11.910> mm-hmm<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.600> do<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.840> lot<00:03:12.990> of

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
plastic guard here mm-hmm I do a lot of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.100 
plastic guard here mm-hmm I do a lot of
stuff<00:03:13.230> slide<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.630> feel<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:15.870> this

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
stuff slide so I just feel like this

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.420 
stuff slide so I just feel like this
could<00:03:16.290> use<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> bit<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.710> protection<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.250> other

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
could use a bit of protection but other

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.220 
could use a bit of protection but other
than<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.640> they<00:03:18.480> nailed<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.020> soleplate

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
than that they nailed it the soleplate

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.190 
than that they nailed it the soleplate
