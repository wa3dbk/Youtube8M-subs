the<00:04:32.889> timeouts<00:04:33.370> on<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.639> outside<00:04:34.290> he<00:04:35.290> added<00:04:35.560> an

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
the timeouts on the outside he added an

extra little loop on the inside so that

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.640 
extra little loop on the inside so that
I<00:04:38.410> could<00:04:38.560> hang<00:04:38.770> stuff<00:04:42.870> as<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:44.380> I

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
wet enough to have stretched steel nylon

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.779 
wet enough to have stretched steel nylon
dough<00:05:25.450> stretch<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.910> actually<00:05:27.910> I<00:05:29.789> retighten

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
dough stretch so I actually I retighten

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.940 
dough stretch so I actually I retighten
my<00:05:30.910> cords<00:05:31.210> for<00:05:31.419> I<00:05:31.479> got<00:05:31.660> in<00:05:31.840> also<00:05:32.770> another

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
my cords for I got in also another

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.180 
my cords for I got in also another
little<00:05:33.099> thing<00:05:33.220> is<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:35.289> self<00:05:35.650> tensioner<00:05:36.160> is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
little thing is the self tensioner is

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.360 
little thing is the self tensioner is
just<00:05:36.400> kind<00:05:36.580> of

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
just kind of

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.640 
just kind of
it<00:05:39.240> kind<00:05:39.419> of<00:05:39.479> hard<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.780> see<00:05:39.960> right<00:05:39.990> here<00:05:40.470> but

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
it kind of hard to see right here but

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.100 
it kind of hard to see right here but
basically<00:05:41.250> these<00:05:41.850> are<00:05:42.030> self<00:05:42.840> tensioning

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
basically these are self tensioning

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.360 
basically these are self tensioning
lines<00:05:46.430> I've<00:05:47.430> got<00:05:48.680> it's<00:05:49.680> kind<00:05:49.889> of<00:05:49.949> hard<00:05:50.130> for<00:05:50.190> me

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
lines I've got it's kind of hard for me

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.110 
lines I've got it's kind of hard for me
to<00:05:50.490> explain<00:05:50.760> but<00:05:52.280> these<00:05:53.280> lines<00:05:53.460> here<00:05:53.820> just

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
to explain but these lines here just

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.370 
to explain but these lines here just
tied<00:05:54.360> to<00:05:55.280> line<00:05:56.280> in<00:05:56.639> a<00:05:56.760> place<00:05:57.030> now<00:05:57.630> basically

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
tied to line in a place now basically

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.530 
tied to line in a place now basically
what<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.650> does<00:05:58.680> is<00:05:59.040> if<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.340> stretch<00:05:59.610> if<00:05:59.940> the

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
what it does is if the stretch if the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.890 
what it does is if the stretch if the
tart<00:06:00.810> starts<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.590> Sag<00:06:02.720> what's<00:06:03.720> going<00:06:03.870> to

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
tart starts to Sag what's going to

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.080 
tart starts to Sag what's going to
happen<00:06:04.290> is<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.860> main<00:06:05.100> line<00:06:05.460> is<00:06:05.760> going<00:06:06.030> to

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
happen is the main line is going to

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.120 
happen is the main line is going to
loosen<00:06:06.510> but<00:06:07.290> these<00:06:07.830> little<00:06:08.370> pieces<00:06:08.580> of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
loosen but these little pieces of

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.070 
loosen but these little pieces of
stretchy<00:06:11.130> cord<00:06:11.430> here<00:06:11.820> they're<00:06:12.690> going<00:06:12.900> to

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
stretchy cord here they're going to

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.200 
stretchy cord here they're going to
actually<00:06:13.229> kind<00:06:13.740> of<00:06:13.800> help<00:06:14.039> to<00:06:14.370> retain<00:06:14.520> a<00:06:14.940> little

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
actually kind of help to retain a little

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.909 
actually kind of help to retain a little
bit<00:06:15.330> of<00:06:15.479> tension<00:06:15.720> on<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.110> tarp<00:06:16.350> so<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:16.650> doesn't

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
bit of tension on the tarp so it doesn't

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.490 
bit of tension on the tarp so it doesn't
completely<00:06:17.190> sank<00:06:17.760> on<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.060> inside<00:06:18.449> and<00:06:19.229> as<00:06:19.350> you

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
completely sank on the inside and as you

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.350 
completely sank on the inside and as you
can<00:06:19.620> see<00:06:19.680> they're<00:06:20.100> they're<00:06:20.490> still<00:06:20.729> tight<00:06:21.120> this

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.129

I'm pulling both of these to a point
rather<00:06:42.210> than<00:06:42.450> pulling<00:06:42.840> them<00:06:42.990> out<00:06:43.229> if<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:44.310> was<00:06:44.430> to

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
rather than pulling them out if I was to

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.070 
rather than pulling them out if I was to
kind<00:06:44.729> of<00:06:44.789> pull<00:06:45.000> them<00:06:45.150> out<00:06:45.360> a<00:06:45.720> little<00:06:45.960> bit

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
kind of pull them out a little bit

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.500 
kind of pull them out a little bit
straight<00:06:46.650> either<00:06:46.860> straight<00:06:47.310> or<00:06:47.520> maybe<00:06:48.150> even<00:06:48.270> a

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
straight either straight or maybe even a

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.210 
straight either straight or maybe even a
little<00:06:48.630> bit<00:06:48.840> back<00:06:49.380> towards<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:49.830> front<00:06:49.860> and

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
little bit back towards the front and

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.060 
little bit back towards the front and
back<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:51.270> would<00:06:51.510> kind<00:06:51.720> of<00:06:51.750> go<00:06:51.930> away<00:06:52.070> but

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
back that would kind of go away but

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.100 
back that would kind of go away but
right<00:06:53.910> here<00:06:54.090> I<00:06:54.180> don't<00:06:54.300> really<00:06:54.510> have<00:06:54.870> anything

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
right here I don't really have anything

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.589 
right here I don't really have anything
to<00:06:55.530> tie<00:06:56.280> those<00:06:56.520> up<00:06:56.729> to<00:06:56.910> and<00:06:57.090> you<00:06:57.120> make<00:06:57.300> do<00:06:57.450> with

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
to tie those up to and you make do with

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.980 
to tie those up to and you make do with
what<00:06:57.780> you<00:06:57.870> got<00:06:58.610> but<00:06:59.610> it<00:06:59.729> worked<00:06:59.910> well<00:07:00.060> but

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
what you got but it worked well but

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.070 
what you got but it worked well but
anyway<00:07:01.220> so<00:07:02.220> this<00:07:02.370> is<00:07:02.430> the<00:07:02.669> OES<00:07:03.240> eight-by-ten

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
anyway so this is the OES eight-by-ten

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.100 
anyway so this is the OES eight-by-ten
seal<00:07:04.410> nylon<00:07:04.830> tarp<00:07:06.320> it<00:07:07.320> weighs<00:07:07.590> I<00:07:09.020> don't<00:07:10.020> know
