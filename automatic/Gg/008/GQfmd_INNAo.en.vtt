dry so I did blow job on me to cap and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
dry so I did blow job on me to cap and
everything<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.790> did<00:01:24.030> try<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> let<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.560> hair

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
everything but I did try to let the hair

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.090

air<00:01:26.250> dry<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.329> as<00:01:27.479> possible<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.649> what<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
air dry as much as possible so what you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.850 
air dry as much as possible so what you
see<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.270> natural<00:01:31.759> way<00:01:32.759> pattern

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
see right now is the natural way pattern

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.469 
see right now is the natural way pattern
so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> did<00:01:35.159> loosen<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.210> bit

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so I did loosen up a little bit

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
so I did loosen up a little bit
throughout<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.469> time<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.950> fleek<00:01:38.159> rolling<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
throughout the time on fleek rolling it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.840 
throughout the time on fleek rolling it
but<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.090> still<00:01:39.329> has<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.990> nice<00:01:40.229> pretty

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
but it still has a really nice pretty

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
but it still has a really nice pretty
natural<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.899> pretty<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
natural way and really pretty so it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.090
