00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.620

 fast because I have to not get there 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.340
 to my destination but I'm so far away that I do not 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.840
 with each site 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.310
 and life is leaving us fast because 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:33.220
 I have to not go to my destination 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.549
 but I'm so far away that I can not look 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.830

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.110
