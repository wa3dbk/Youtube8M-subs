so I plan on again a ps4 later down the

because honestly well I'll make a

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.450 
because honestly well I'll make a
impression<00:01:14.630> video<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:15.590> my<00:01:15.890> thoughts<00:01:16.190> on<00:01:16.370> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
impression video of my thoughts on the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.660 
impression video of my thoughts on the
ps4<00:01:16.730> as<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.420> right<00:01:17.570> now<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:18.340> first<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.549> all

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
ps4 as of right now but first of all

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.170 
ps4 as of right now but first of all
will<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.659> ps4<00:01:21.159> DualShock<00:01:22.159> 4<00:01:22.369> controller<00:01:22.400> work

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
will the ps4 DualShock 4 controller work

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.969 
will the ps4 DualShock 4 controller work
on<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.869> ps3<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:26.140> first<00:01:27.140> things<00:01:27.409> first<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.860> I

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
on the ps3 so first things first is I

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.730 
on the ps3 so first things first is I
need<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.220> cable<00:01:28.640> because<00:01:29.479> apparently<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.320> have

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
need a cable because apparently I have

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.370 
need a cable because apparently I have
thousands<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.610> thousands<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.329> mini<00:01:33.170> USB

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
thousands and thousands of mini USB

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.679 
thousands and thousands of mini USB
cables<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.659> can't<00:01:35.990> find<00:01:36.259> worth<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.619> damn<00:01:36.829> of

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
cables but I can't find worth a damn of

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.190 
cables but I can't find worth a damn of
micro<00:01:38.689> USB<00:01:39.200> cables<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.810> managed<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.899> find

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
micro USB cables so I managed to find

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.100 
micro USB cables so I managed to find
one<00:01:42.290> let's<00:01:43.250> see<00:01:43.460> if<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:43.700> works<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.210> usually

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
one let's see if this works so usually

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.959 
one let's see if this works so usually
when<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.500> want<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.009> connect<00:01:46.579> another

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
when you want to connect another

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.240 
when you want to connect another
controller<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.560> ps3<00:01:49.930> I'm<00:01:50.930> assuming<00:01:51.590> ps4

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
controller to the ps3 I'm assuming ps4

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.389 
controller to the ps3 I'm assuming ps4
is<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.729> just<00:01:52.909> take<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.210> controller

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
is that you just take the controller

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.359 
is that you just take the controller
plug<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.549> in

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:09.830 

and<00:02:03.539> turn<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.689> on

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.520 

and<00:02:09.929> look<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:11.340> actually<00:02:11.459> does<00:02:12.030> work<00:02:18.530> now

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and look it actually does work now

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.820 
and look it actually does work now
there's<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.099> caveat<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.780> cable<00:02:25.380> has

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
there's a caveat with this the cable has

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.460 
there's a caveat with this the cable has
to<00:02:26.099> be<00:02:26.250> connected<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.569> won't<00:02:27.930> work

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
to be connected it won't work

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.559 
to be connected it won't work
wirelessly<00:02:30.470> but<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.739> does<00:02:31.920> work<00:02:32.330> when<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
wirelessly but it does work when is

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.839 
wirelessly but it does work when is
actually<00:02:33.959> connected<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.920> which<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.489> kind

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
actually connected on here which is kind

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.490 
actually connected on here which is kind
of<00:02:35.910> odd<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.480> ask<00:02:36.690> me<00:02:36.959> because<00:02:37.110> they're

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
of odd if you ask me because they're

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.850 
of odd if you ask me because they're
both<00:02:37.620> Bluetooth<00:02:38.160> remotes<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.470> fact<00:02:40.709> that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
both Bluetooth remotes and the fact that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.960 
both Bluetooth remotes and the fact that
on<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> ps3

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
on the ps3

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.270 
on the ps3
now<00:02:42.630> obviously<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.290> touchpad<00:02:43.560> isn't<00:02:44.160> going

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
now obviously the touchpad isn't going

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:55.250 
now obviously the touchpad isn't going
to<00:02:44.370> work

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.830 

to<00:02:55.799> share<00:02:56.129> an<00:02:56.370> option<00:02:56.819> button<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.659> button

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
to share an option button and the button

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.740 
to share an option button and the button
for<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> touchpad<00:02:58.700> doesn't<00:02:59.700> work<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.390> guess

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
for the touchpad doesn't work so I guess

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.569 
for the touchpad doesn't work so I guess
what<00:03:04.079> we'll<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:07.099> pull<00:03:08.099> up<00:03:08.189> a<00:03:08.310> game<00:03:08.549> I

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
what we'll do is a pull up a game I

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.610 
what we'll do is a pull up a game I
guess

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.480 

sure

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.970 

but<00:03:19.030> yeah<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.210> think<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.990> way<00:03:20.140> it's<00:03:20.530> set<00:03:20.860> up

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
but yeah I think the way it's set up

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.560 
but yeah I think the way it's set up
that<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.690> need<00:03:22.870> use<00:03:23.050> control<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.740> ps3

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
that if you need use control for the ps3

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.320 
that if you need use control for the ps3
just<00:03:25.570> connected<00:03:26.290> through<00:03:26.500> wired<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.330> you're

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
just connected through wired and you're

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:38.339 
just connected through wired and you're
set<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.830> yeah<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.070> does<00:03:33.220> work

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.449 

PlayStation<00:03:39.250> button<00:03:39.459> is<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.090> doing<00:03:40.690> anything

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.630 

okay<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.120> option<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.750> start<00:03:47.640> afterburner

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
okay so the option is start afterburner

00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:00.780 
okay so the option is start afterburner
climax<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:58.000> like<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.450> said<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:59.790> PlayStation

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
climax and like I said the PlayStation

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.809 
climax and like I said the PlayStation
button<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.390> not<00:04:01.569> working<00:04:02.489> sure<00:04:03.489> button

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
button is not working sure button

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.900 
button is not working sure button
doesn't<00:04:03.970> do<00:04:04.150> anything

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.250 

so<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.930> guess<00:04:11.230> if<00:04:11.650> you're<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.460> fence<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:13.260> if

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
so I guess if you're on the fence of if

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.170 
so I guess if you're on the fence of if
you're<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.560> ps3<00:04:14.920> owner<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:15.790> want<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.090> get

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
you're a ps3 owner and you want to get

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.850 
you're a ps3 owner and you want to get
DualShock<00:04:16.600> 4<00:04:16.840> controller<00:04:16.870> as<00:04:17.380> your<00:04:17.530> primary

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
DualShock 4 controller as your primary

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.580 
DualShock 4 controller as your primary
um<00:04:21.330> not<00:04:22.330> everything<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.170> work<00:04:23.230> on

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
um not everything is going to work on

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.790 
um not everything is going to work on
here<00:04:23.890> we're<00:04:24.400> just<00:04:24.580> kind<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.970> odd

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:52.829

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:52.839 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.909
