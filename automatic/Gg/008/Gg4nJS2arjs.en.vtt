00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
how good you guys can see them but

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
how good you guys can see them but
they're<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.200> full<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.879> what's<00:00:38.879> called

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
they're just full of what's called

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
they're just full of what's called
pyrite<00:00:39.899> or<00:00:40.140> fool's<00:00:40.200> gold<00:00:42.860> see<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.219> get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
pyrite or fool's gold see if I can get

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.750 
pyrite or fool's gold see if I can get
it<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> different<00:00:44.789> angle<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.610> got

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it on a different angle there and we got

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.189 
it on a different angle there and we got
some<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> purple<00:00:50.190> colored<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
some more of the purple colored I

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.790 
some more of the purple colored I
believe<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.699> quartz<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.590> got

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
believe it's a quartz and then we got

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
believe it's a quartz and then we got
this<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.610> guy<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.300> he's<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.809> loaded

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this little guy here he's just loaded

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.369 
this little guy here he's just loaded
would<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> look<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> bunch<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.309> crystals<00:00:59.609> I

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
would it look like a bunch of crystals I

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
would it look like a bunch of crystals I
don't<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.440> how<00:01:01.649> good<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.980> guys<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.399> see

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
don't know how good you guys can see

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
don't know how good you guys can see
that<00:01:06.140> again<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.500> believe<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:09.740> pyrite

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that again I believe it is just pyrite

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.210 
that again I believe it is just pyrite
and<00:01:11.780> all<00:01:12.780> kinds<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> crystal<00:01:13.590> form<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.040> guess

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and all kinds of crystal form I guess

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.789 
and all kinds of crystal form I guess
because<00:01:14.689> all<00:01:15.689> through<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> Rockets<00:01:16.650> all

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
because all through the Rockets all

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
because all through the Rockets all
pyrite<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.900> quartz<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
pyrite as well and quartz so that's just

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.719 
pyrite as well and quartz so that's just
a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> collection<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.430> bring

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
a little bit of the collection I bring

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
a little bit of the collection I bring
the<00:01:23.880> rocks<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> I'll<00:01:25.020> break<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.470> in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the rocks on here and I'll break them in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.210 
the rocks on here and I'll break them in
half<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.400> what's<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.380> over

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
half just to see what's in them and over

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.929 
half just to see what's in them and over
here<00:01:30.560> after<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.829> break<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.280> half<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
here after I break them in half I do a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.020 
here after I break them in half I do a
little<00:01:33.150> bit<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> panning<00:01:34.549> it's<00:01:35.549> more<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:35.909> less

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
little bit of panning it's more or less

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.719 
little bit of panning it's more or less
a<00:01:36.060> half<00:01:36.420> left<00:01:36.720> anything<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
a half left anything right now as you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.420 
a half left anything right now as you
can<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.600> getting<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.049> pyrite<00:01:41.009> or

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
can see all I'm getting is pyrite or

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.929 
can see all I'm getting is pyrite or
fool's<00:01:41.460> gold<00:01:42.890> nice<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:44.280> rock<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
fool's gold nice little rock of it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.929 
fool's gold nice little rock of it
they're<00:01:45.149> pretty<00:01:45.899> much<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.729> pyrite<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:47.909> fool's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
they're pretty much all pyrite or fool's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380 
they're pretty much all pyrite or fool's
gold

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.870 

lonna<00:01:54.880> dust<00:01:55.880> flakes<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.990> a<00:02:00.460> lot<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.610> powder

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
lonna dust flakes and a lot of powder

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.420 
lonna dust flakes and a lot of powder
little<00:02:02.330> pickers<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.230> stuff<00:02:03.470> like<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.220> I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
little pickers and stuff like that but I

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.650 
little pickers and stuff like that but I
tried<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:06.250> tried<00:02:07.250> pretty<00:02:07.760> much<00:02:07.850> testing<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.450> all

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
tried I tried pretty much testing it all

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.230 
tried I tried pretty much testing it all
and<00:02:09.050> hit<00:02:09.470> all<00:02:09.590> it's<00:02:10.310> all<00:02:10.490> pretty<00:02:10.700> much<00:02:10.790> fool's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
and hit all it's all pretty much fool's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.240 
and hit all it's all pretty much fool's
gold<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.720> didn't<00:02:11.930> didn't<00:02:12.350> find<00:02:12.500> any<00:02:12.740> real<00:02:12.950> gold

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
gold I didn't didn't find any real gold

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.710 
gold I didn't didn't find any real gold
so<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.920> too<00:02:16.070> yellow<00:02:16.310> right<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:17.120> guess<00:02:17.540> it's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
so it's too yellow right I guess it's

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.310 
so it's too yellow right I guess it's
too<00:02:17.930> yellow

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
too yellow

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.630 
too yellow
but<00:02:18.640> thanks<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:19.670> thanks<00:02:20.150> for<00:02:20.270> watching
