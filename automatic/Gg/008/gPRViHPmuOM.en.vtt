seen anything that really shows exactly
but<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:23.880> take<00:00:23.910> quite<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.420> while<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
but it would take quite a while to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.269 
but it would take quite a while to
figure<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.230> exactly<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.830> they're<00:00:25.980> doing

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
can do it the way i just showed then the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.430 
can do it the way i just showed then the
chords<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.660> some<00:02:37.660> people<00:02:38.020> I've<00:02:38.140> watched

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
chords like some people I've watched

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.590 
chords like some people I've watched
some<00:02:38.590> covers<00:02:38.920> people<00:02:39.310> doing<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.760> they

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
some covers people doing it and they

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.180 
some covers people doing it and they
definitely<00:02:40.750> don't<00:02:41.140> change<00:02:41.500> chords<00:02:41.920> as<00:02:42.010> much

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
definitely don't change chords as much

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.580 
definitely don't change chords as much
as<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.490> was<00:02:42.640> hearing<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:44.020> then<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.230> found<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
as I was hearing and then I found a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.470 
as I was hearing and then I found a
chord<00:02:44.830> chart<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.340> seems<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.760> get<00:02:45.910> out<00:02:46.120> most

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
chord chart that seems to get out most

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000 
chord chart that seems to get out most
of<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.690> chord<00:02:46.959> changes<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.680> make<00:02:47.830> sure<00:02:47.860> you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
of the chord changes so make sure you

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.360 
of the chord changes so make sure you
pull<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.340> up<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.560> I'll<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.069> play<00:02:51.250> along

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
pull this up and I'll just play along

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.260 
pull this up and I'll just play along
the<00:02:51.670> first<00:02:51.880> two<00:02:52.450> parts<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.319> see<00:02:53.530> it

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
the first two parts so you can see it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.550 
the first two parts so you can see it
and<00:02:55.270> one<00:02:55.390> thing<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.840> I'm<00:02:56.110> going<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.319> go<00:02:56.470> to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and one thing like I'm going to go to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.430 
and one thing like I'm going to go to
full<00:02:56.860> d7<00:02:57.420> really<00:02:58.420> i<00:02:58.450> only<00:02:58.720> spent<00:02:58.930> up<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.110> here

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
full d7 really i only spent up to here

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.740 
full d7 really i only spent up to here
usually<00:02:59.620> for<00:02:59.950> d7<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:02.230> then<00:03:02.440> when<00:03:02.620> he<00:03:02.650> says

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
usually for d7 and then when he says

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.270 
usually for d7 and then when he says
when<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.870> goes<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.260> iphone<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.860> burn<00:03:06.070> like

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
when it goes to the iphone to burn like

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.690 
when it goes to the iphone to burn like
a<00:03:06.310> fire<00:03:06.610> i<00:03:06.640> play<00:03:07.030> normal<00:03:07.390> d<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.950> d7<00:03:09.489> still

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
a fire i play normal d the d7 still

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.390 
a fire i play normal d the d7 still
works<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.410> think<00:03:11.410> regular<00:03:11.590> d<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.100> sounds

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
works I think regular d just sounds

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.840 
works I think regular d just sounds
better<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:13.480> playing<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.840> by<00:03:13.989> yourself<00:03:14.850> so

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
better for playing this by yourself so

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:35.890 
better for playing this by yourself so
here<00:03:16.300> we<00:03:16.330> go<00:03:30.569> starts<00:03:31.569> on<00:03:31.690> g<00:03:31.959> g<00:03:33.600> c/g

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
here we go starts on g g c/g

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:46.250 
here we go starts on g g c/g
see<00:03:36.829> what<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.129> see<00:03:37.400> there

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.420 

you

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.059 

the<00:03:54.909> regular<00:03:55.239> g

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:14.140 

you

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.729 

so<00:04:16.220> trick<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:18.840> gotta<00:04:18.989> switch<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.470> c

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
so trick is like you gotta switch to c

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.300 
so trick is like you gotta switch to c
and<00:04:19.769> d<00:04:20.010> like<00:04:20.489> real<00:04:20.699> quick<00:04:21.710> and<00:04:22.710> also<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.130> sounds

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
and d like real quick and also it sounds

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.189 
and d like real quick and also it sounds
cool<00:04:23.610> if<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:23.970> like<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:26.900> kind<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.930> like<00:04:28.139> a

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
cool if you go like you kind of like a

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.290 
cool if you go like you kind of like a
little<00:04:28.350> palm<00:04:28.830> mute<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.910> i'll<00:04:30.060> say<00:04:30.240> you

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
little palm mute and i'll say you

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.480 
little palm mute and i'll say you
alternate<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> base<00:04:31.130> that's<00:04:32.130> what<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.310> mean

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
alternate the base that's what I mean

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
alternate the base that's what I mean
like<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.760> would<00:04:32.850> take<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> lot<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.240> thing<00:04:33.419> I

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
like it would take a lot of thing I

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.790 
like it would take a lot of thing I
exactly<00:04:33.990> what<00:04:34.080> they're<00:04:34.199> doing<00:04:34.500> with<00:04:34.620> this

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
exactly what they're doing with this

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.140 
exactly what they're doing with this
because<00:04:35.250> sometimes<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.669> hear<00:04:35.790> like<00:04:35.850> little

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
because sometimes you hear like little

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.860 
because sometimes you hear like little
descending<00:04:36.660> things<00:04:36.900> or<00:04:37.199> ascending<00:04:37.680> things

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
descending things or ascending things

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.360 
descending things or ascending things
but<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:40.199> tend<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.410> just<00:04:40.650> like<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:40.919> G<00:04:41.130> chord

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
but I just tend to just like on G chord

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.640 
but I just tend to just like on G chord
i'll<00:04:41.490> just<00:04:41.669> do<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:45.150> g<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.930> base<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.440> d

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
i'll just do like g the base to d

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.740 
i'll just do like g the base to d
because<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.580> do<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:47.970> lot<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.419> sometimes<00:04:48.539> I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
because I do that a lot and sometimes I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.839 
because I do that a lot and sometimes I
hear

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.010 

no<00:04:53.809> you<00:04:53.959> can<00:04:54.080> go<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.229> be<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:56.479> then<00:04:56.659> when<00:04:56.809> you<00:04:56.899> go

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
no you can go to be and then when you go

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.389 
no you can go to be and then when you go
to<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.169> C<00:04:57.439> chord<00:04:57.679> make<00:04:57.889> sure<00:04:58.039> you<00:04:58.129> really<00:04:58.339> hit

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:59.619 
to a C chord make sure you really hit

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
the base they don't really want to strum

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:04.299 
the base they don't really want to strum
like<00:05:01.839> you<00:05:02.839> could<00:05:03.050> do<00:05:03.199> that<00:05:03.349> but<00:05:03.679> to<00:05:04.039> get<00:05:04.129> more

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.360 
little tricky to figure out to mix the
chords<00:06:35.080> but<00:06:35.229> you<00:06:35.349> could<00:06:35.530> just<00:06:35.680> play<00:06:36.009> the<00:06:36.189> notes

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
chords but you could just play the notes

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.119
