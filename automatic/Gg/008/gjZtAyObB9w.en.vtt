and you're going to cruise speed oliver

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.180 
and you're going to cruise speed oliver
64<00:04:22.100> my<00:04:22.310> its<00:04:22.460> power<00:04:25.180> ok<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.240> now<00:04:26.770> your<00:04:27.770> ally<00:04:28.040> has

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
64 my its power ok so now your ally has

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.450 
64 my its power ok so now your ally has
ranks<00:04:28.669> so<00:04:29.300> if<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:30.260> want<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.680> certain<00:04:31.100> rank<00:04:31.280> to

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
be able to be the only rank the flattest

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.220 
be able to be the only rank the flattest
for<00:04:33.740> example<00:04:34.220> for<00:04:34.730> my<00:04:34.850> airline<00:04:35.210> only<00:04:35.690> second<00:04:36.169> I

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
for example for my airline only second I

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.500 
for example for my airline only second I
mean<00:04:36.470> first<00:04:36.650> officers<00:04:37.160> can<00:04:37.370> fly<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.610> crj700

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
mean first officers can fly the crj700

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.570 
mean first officers can fly the crj700
you<00:04:39.230> can<00:04:39.350> do<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> same<00:04:39.560> thing<00:04:39.919> for<00:04:40.040> here<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.520> if

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
you can do the same thing for here so if

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.740

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
and this is basically but your virtual

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.530 
and this is basically but your virtual
realized<00:07:48.700> operations<00:07:49.210> are<00:07:49.270> going<00:07:49.420> to<00:07:49.480> be

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:49.540 
realized operations are going to be

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.860 
realized operations are going to be
based<00:07:49.720> off<00:07:49.900> of<00:07:49.960> the<00:07:50.590> airline<00:07:50.800> operations<00:07:51.220> tab

based on fleet airports and airlines and

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.070 
based on fleet airports and airlines and
schedule<00:07:55.680> so<00:07:56.680> right<00:07:57.010> now<00:07:57.040> I<00:07:57.510> think<00:07:58.510> that<00:07:58.930> to<00:07:59.050> be

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 
schedule so right now I think that to be

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.410 
schedule so right now I think that to be
the<00:07:59.320> end<00:07:59.470> of<00:07:59.530> the<00:07:59.620> tutorial<00:08:00.210> the<00:08:01.210> next

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:01.420
