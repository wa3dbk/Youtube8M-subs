00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
I can do it cleaner with the second

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.710 
I can do it cleaner with the second
finger<00:01:08.830> but<00:01:09.100> if<00:01:09.400> first<00:01:09.970> works<00:01:10.300> for<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:10.570> that's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
finger but if first works for you that's

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.870 
finger but if first works for you that's
cool<00:01:10.990> too<00:01:11.200> what<00:01:12.130> I'm<00:01:12.220> trying<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.490> do<00:01:12.550> is<00:01:12.670> when<00:01:12.820> I

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
cool too what I'm trying to do is when I

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.450 
cool too what I'm trying to do is when I
do<00:01:12.940> my<00:01:13.119> pull<00:01:13.390> off<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.720> pull<00:01:13.960> down<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.400> I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
do my pull off I pull down so that I

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:25.170 
do my pull off I pull down so that I
kind<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.760> rest<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.450> next<00:01:16.630> string

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.330

many<00:01:34.060> strings<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.700> good<00:01:36.970> thing<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
many strings that's a good thing to

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.880 
many strings that's a good thing to
practice<00:01:37.570> hammer<00:01:38.020> ons<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.320> pull<00:01:38.409> off<00:01:38.680> with

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890

basically the same thing it's all using
the<00:03:45.090> D<00:03:45.300> minor<00:03:45.510> pentatonic<00:03:45.900> scale<00:03:47.030> except<00:03:48.030> for
