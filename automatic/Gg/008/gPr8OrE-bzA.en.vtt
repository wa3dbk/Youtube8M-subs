 Kuwait City CCB g 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.429
 I would like to introduce you something that does not exist in Germany at all 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 in each probably the tiresome topic 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.089
 The fair fishing will continue 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.989
 already is 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.310
 Heinemann Ingram 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 Hannemann on the normal lake Altenbeken 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.850
 modern bands sang the youth determined to simply print situation 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 not every time 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.150
 the whole club athletic 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.640
 again the English 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 Germany's farmers 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.400
 Spark Tristesse fits in my pocket 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.700
 My pocket 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.050
 measurable 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.530
 I hate it 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.120
 we will print and scream 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.520
 it was raining 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.150
 it's really only two 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.690
 that the card is off 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.250
 inform once 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.210
 the short piece 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.580
 be accompanied 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.350
 that developed long in the message 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.850
 more distance 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.850
 to the actual Banks Accidentally later 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.450
 Although the public worked so well at least four Banks 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.400
 Dix 2 2 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.930
 now slow with anyway 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 these two small items too 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.530
 a full-fledged red-red warning 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 Coach Jens Martens 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.090
 always you are not you with Waser Pope 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 it's just the front piece 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.339
 here come the second weakest dax worth 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 a page 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.409
 I can counter with Tec Index DAX 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.189
 Become braafheid 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.189
 that's exactly what you can do the compensation 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.089
 long time 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.579
 Caldwell minus 14 degrees 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.249
 you can push everything there 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.249
 the two are not 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.919
 that means for everyone 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.739
 when you paint 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 the principle 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.909
 Walkman 14 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.009
 HP too thick too 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.770

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.849
 majority 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.849
 muffled 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.689
 that is and remains the praise of praise 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 Differences just have to go through the village 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 and trends 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.020
 d 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.509
 only with five DAX DAX 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.020
 before you probably train here anyway 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.870
 the Banque CIC Suisse 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.020
 to imagine everything 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.020
 the DAX DAX ETR 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 just open up 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.150
 Brankovic

 Stegmann dry 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.400
 just as scared 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.089
 it is like at approx 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.139

 everything imaginable Rüdiger Max fresh 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.699
 you stay even more wit 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.979
 everything is possible 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.979
 the small package 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.270
 Now I'll show them for a moment 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.270
 how fast you can then build Russia again 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.219
 It was the Beck's Pils 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.430
 Tickets are off 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.819
 unscrew a lot 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.520
 very practical 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.419
 to stay a Swede 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.419
 that's made of stainless steel it's right 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.059
 good material very very robust 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.569
 I think it's clapping 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.860
 the little one up 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.800

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.460

 Glover with the good course moped 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:16.059
 At the moment it costs limited 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.080
 Present must be present 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:33.689
 you have quasi 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:35.430
 fully connected 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.860

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.559
 not a Lex Pechstein » 

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:03.689

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:04.489
