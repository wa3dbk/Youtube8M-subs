00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
with that the only thing I'm concerned

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.120

with is losing too much weight ok and
I'll<00:03:08.030> figure<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.480> out<00:03:08.510> when<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> comes<00:03:09.230> or<00:03:09.500> if

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
I'll figure that out when it comes or if

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.610 
I'll figure that out when it comes or if
it<00:03:09.769> happens<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.549> feels<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:10.910> I'm<00:03:11.120> um

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it happens if it feels like I'm um

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.840 
it happens if it feels like I'm um
dwindling<00:03:12.620> then<00:03:12.920> I'll<00:03:13.070> figure<00:03:13.280> something<00:03:13.700> out

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
dwindling then I'll figure something out

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.150 
dwindling then I'll figure something out
other<00:03:14.720> than<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.170> don't<00:03:15.380> think<00:03:15.769> it'll<00:03:16.040> be

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
other than that I don't think it'll be

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.370 
other than that I don't think it'll be
too<00:03:16.280> much<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.120> know<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.570> probably<00:03:17.959> be

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
too much you know I just probably be

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.000 
too much you know I just probably be
