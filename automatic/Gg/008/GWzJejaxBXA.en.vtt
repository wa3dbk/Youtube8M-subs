00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.250
 from many sites in the world we can only marvel at 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 as the ancient people cut and moved stones that weighed up 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.350
 100 tons of the unctad some archaeologists have been very 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.460
 surprised by ancient delicacies that have come to light in the last 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.679
 decades 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.679
 one of the most disconcerting could rewrite history 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.279
 that everyone thinks thomas edison invented the bulb 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.220
 Inside an ancient Egyptian temple some strange reliefs speak 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.010
 of a mysterious symbolism 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.660
 most Egyptologists believe that it represents the birth of a god 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.630
 but others say it's hieroglyphic speaking of an old electric bulb 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.540
 with filament and electric cable in this presumably spectacular life and 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.520
 look at electricity because it was not invented and our civilization to the saud 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.700
 al-faisal 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.730
 from 1 100 years existing 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 his style was forgotten a shared knowledge 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.180
 it is difficult to assimilate but there are those who have raised it in another way 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.150
 like the ancient Egyptians honest workshop hieroglyphs and drawings inside 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.460
 of a dark pyramid 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.960
 they discard oil lamps and torches because they have found little 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 traces of soot inside the pyramids 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.400
 then they may have used good piles very far from egypt in the years 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.730
 30 some archeologists found an extraordinary contraption that proved 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.360
 that the people who lived there two thousand years ago had not made a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.920
 electric battery 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 it is now known as the Baghdad pile 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.680
 Damaris affects many of these things like the Iranian elections 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.450
 borja oubiña mg be a step to a few the winter what would 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.610
 necessary to make the pile of Baghdad is quite simple I go out 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.140
 dignity to strike this cost 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.390
 she alone 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.320
 nobody knew where it was and evidently on platforms by the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.440
 vessel would be full of dinars is tremendous 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.170
 together the vinegar acid causes an electrical reaction 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.239
 the original landscape and I do not have them with a rollover was forced to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 approximately Ricardo Mello schools 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.160
 Half a volt is not much electricity 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.600
 and it's still a mystery because they made electric batteries two thousand years ago 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.870
 years it could have been the stack of baghdad left something similar what it did 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.440
 possible the Egyptian light bulb we may be able to find the answer to this 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.389
 question inside 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.739
 writer felix romeo has recently built a theme park that 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.360
 revolves around the theory of ancient astronauts 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.510
 and has an incredible exhibition about the bulb of ancient Egypt 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.760
 for publicist carolina snyder the light bulb is an extraordinary idea 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.599
 may they say 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.510
 therefore they must have a way of understanding it within the pyramids 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.019
 centers this is a possibility I do not know if it will be true or not but the simple idea 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.019
 that they could invent it is quite surprising 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.989
 in the theme park of the fonamih that in the light bulb works with replicas of 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.989
 the vaccinated pile 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.469
 but they wanted to represent a light bulb with that image 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
 that would be just an idea of ​​someone's wild imagination 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.209
 was the emotion to the thousands of condoms that was not the same as I ask my 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.419
 brothers fit for the event here I can guarantee is that if you do that in the 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.730
 what about a light bulb 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.959
 and it would be something like a Jewish aubergine 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.009
 difficult is the hand you think is a last bulb 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.459
 Cuba thinks it's spoken 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.479
 we know that one thing does not attack the red metal against the crystal and 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.169
 data center management are the source of energy aie for the 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.269
 second and llallagua era and that would be the physical proof
