black senses we've got the licenses for
high<00:04:24.110> technica<00:04:24.560> tech<00:04:25.370> composites<00:04:26.260> that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
high technica tech composites that

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.719 
high technica tech composites that
taught<00:04:27.440> its<00:04:27.590> manufacturing<00:04:28.190> for<00:04:28.430> us<00:04:28.520> and

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
taught its manufacturing for us and

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.610 
taught its manufacturing for us and
they're<00:04:29.300> under<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.540> pilot<00:04:29.960> program<00:04:30.110> now<00:04:30.410> we're

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
they're under a pilot program now we're

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.170 
they're under a pilot program now we're
developing<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.100> processes<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.880> quality

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
developing the processes of the quality

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.030 
developing the processes of the quality
control<00:04:32.510> systems<00:04:32.870> locally<00:04:33.229> so<00:04:33.740> we're<00:04:34.010> very

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
control systems locally so we're very

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.860 
control systems locally so we're very
convinced<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.940> capability<00:04:35.539> exists

convinced that the capability exists

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.129 
convinced that the capability exists
here<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.320> we<00:04:36.590> bring<00:04:36.830> our<00:04:37.300> process<00:04:38.300> know<00:04:38.510> how

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
here and we bring our process know how

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.020 
here and we bring our process know how
will<00:04:39.289> equip<00:04:39.590> India<00:04:39.919> industry<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.550> expand

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
will equip India industry to expand
