00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 good friends here we are in a new 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.179
 video feed our 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.429
 canaries today it's the turn of the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.200
 screen so let's talk a little 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.020
 about her 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.220
 ok let's start talking a little bit about 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.500
 the Apple 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.490
 first of all I will talk about the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.529
 benefits and how it should be used so 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 I recommend it and I use it to my 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.010
 personal experience I use it in summer 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.310
 very hot day 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.340
 I use it a lot because it moisturizes a lot 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.190
 eat fast is easy to digest and is 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.190
 very soft then it is tremendously 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.050
 well moisturizes a lot and canaries do not 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.020
 they arise they do not suffer so much heat and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.360
 dehydration and it's very good so 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.260
 remember for the hot days in 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.900
 apple summer okay now let's talk 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.570
 from the other side of the coin 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.570
 for what the apple should not be used 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.790
 excluded at least to my experience 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.000
 of 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.370
 raise with apples that I want to say then 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.070
 while parents are fine when 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.920
 the babies are born and the parents are 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.550
 feeding the forgetting of the apple 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.040
 bring any milk is more expensive because it will 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.620
 give more problems than benefits and 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.930
 you know for breeding broccoli is very good 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.550
 very nutritious evans tremendous environment 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.870
 wind 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.170
 and well you know if the child forget you 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.330
 you already know broccoli breeding is fundamental 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.600
 and a good breeding paste that you 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.950
 I'll leave for a corner of the video to 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.659
 see so you know how it's done and like 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.829
 that I forgot and not least 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.189
 say a couple of days just the apple 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:00.159
 a week enough do not charge them of 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.189
 apple because it produces diarrhea 23 days 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.570
 enough per week is enough and now we're going 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.110
 to 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.000
 to lie one of the I'll take the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.000
 you raise the young 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.340
 they separated from the shorter parents 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.340
 in 44 pieces of sack this the seed 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.220
 it has been made long sides of the metro 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.280
 and it's going very well you already know for breeding 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.110
 forgotten but once it looks like 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.110
 young is a good food 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.060
 and if I do not like the pups very well 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.060
 they like it a lot 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.319
 and well you know we just take this away 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:06.260
 now let's throw the canaries 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.769
 to see how they eat it 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.129
 the oscars the hillsides to see how it is 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.129
 I eat them 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.800
 if we leave it there in the ball and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.970
 they put them all 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.970
 here maybe 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.260
 let's leave them 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.849
 they are very scary because I just 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.750
 separate and well you know that the 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.460
 young birds we are 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.970
 they are very scary yes 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.000
 and good will be made to my presence is like 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.920
 always so let's see how the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.190
 eat 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.520
