00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.910
 Then we want to make sandblasting masking sheet using loco film 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.650
 I'm sorry 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.550
 Necessary impact is here . 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.230
 It is a box containing 50 pro blues and can be opened later 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.870
 Yes this is a sheet that makes reflections Daiichi pc and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.840
 fine 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.270
 Not black 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.290
 It is such a sheet 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.950
 You will need at Yes it and Scotch tape club 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:45.520
 So here is alcohol for fuel 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:50.370
 Please prepare it with a blowout planted number and then prepare for a cutter knife or morning stem love 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.370
 Its Once I would like to 6 large little explanation 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.120
 My name is Record Key d 500. 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.300
 a 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.300
 It is only data when it is what kind of thing 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.789
 It is such a thing 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.969
 I entered one uv light this little put switch and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.510
 It is the state called 4th floor stern Ghan 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 In a 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.740
 Click here to open this Tsutsuno You ne bonding method 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.250
 In short but such state waiting for that has become this kind of transparency I will Let's do a transparent tube of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.680
 The remains addicted to not be in another it is why there will be accounting, Inc. 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.270
 That's nice ultraviolet rays Oh 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 UV rays 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.510
 Fachky 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.790
 In-like against the ultraviolet rays it is not the where the six that burned the document on film 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.010
 It is a refrain 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.390
 I am 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.260
 And to this I it is is Here 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.950
 Nobility 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.189
 It is rubber 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:09.080
 Here it's a little has become felt-like fabric even though 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:16.570
 The point is that the film and the original are stacked and wound in close contact with each other. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.570
 Reflect to you There is a kind of opportunity and exposure 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.490
 Then I will do the current way of making or print out 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.870
 a 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:36.960
 Anything is fine in image editing software Illustrator on the PC 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.030
 Make a manuscript like this This is used in the trial set of Eroko Building 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.319
 It becomes a manuscript 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.860
 It is a little up in terms of letters, but it is from 10 points to 12 points 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.410
 This live also has become a fine of about 5 points line 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.950
 This is it 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.950
 Nanami 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.650
 I will enter a bit if you say that print 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:04.720
 mp fine u black a here is the point 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:10.480
 Improve the forest on ohp sheets 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:16.090
 It is a sheet coated with a drug, so I understand that it has a slippery noodle and a shiny life 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.210
 If you have a hard time touching it and your finger stops printing it here 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.320
 But is the printer 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.120
 8 home recommend you doing here Epson Corporation 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.950
 Did did in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.390
 pmg 4500 this is good 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:38.120
 So I think I want to do printing method 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.950
 The screen of the printer settings for printing is displayed a bit, so please take a look 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.740
 a 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.980
 Can you up 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.100
 I usually think that it is plain paper here 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.110
 In this 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.340
 The most beautiful escort horse in this setting is called the photo sticker. 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.920
 To 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.860
 And gray scale 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:03.230
 Please put out in absolute black and white, as it may become lighter if used in color, so gray 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.800
 Set to scale black and white mode 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.910
 I will go into a little more detailed settings 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.680
 Advanced Setting 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.299
 5 sounds good 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:19.579
 Let's start clearly, so let's try a little bit more 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.600
 koko made you Yes in the It's brightness This -25 usually about this cartoonist 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.870
 Is it zero? 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:29.550
 This is also write Well the brightness that I think has become 1 or zero 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:37.520
 I think a good set that eats mark so that the black is the best 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.520
 The setting is almost like this, so I will print on 5 Black here. 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:47.060
 Printing came out 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:50.030
 As you see, you can see that it's quite black and you're out with macros 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:57.170
 Well then I will use fluorescent light 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:05:01.430
 You can see that the trend and the dark part in the middle of this are no longer visible 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:07.130
 It is not in the state which is not attached It does not pass ultraviolet rays by this anymore 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.760
 It's about this that you ca n't fail to put out at this level of concentration. 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.050
 Then 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.449
 Essential than you count on from so now the difference 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:19.909
 Yeah like is the fact that can not be developed or to be not solved the film because of the individual 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.909
 It becomes the point that close is called firmly 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:32.480
 Well then I'm going to develop from the other side but this is also a window 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:36.820
 Since this is also UV bang, it must be a curtain 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.820
 This must be awfully associated 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:49.740
 Naturally , the film will be difficult to develop when exposed to ultraviolet light, as it is exposed to that ultraviolet light 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:54.500
 Be sure to use a curtain on the window and work on fluorescent lights. 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.500
 I think it's all right with this brightness 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:03.139
 There still we will promote ultra Puroguru 10 sheets box 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:09.199
 I'm in a box like this I can open a little 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:13.110
 This about the size of the sheet is has entered ten say this looks like this feeling 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:17.380
 The script I printed out earlier 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.660
 We cut only one piece this alternative 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.040
 A little larger size 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.610
 Cut 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.069
 Maybe this is a little bigger 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.069
 Here, please slightly larger cut aware without fogging undue importance 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:35.790
 Even if this is about the inside of the frame 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.790
 Problem 2 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.850
 This is about a picker and the size of the manuscript is about this 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.139
 I think N and this is the best 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.320
 so 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.440
 Yeah yeah 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.530
 8 High film used is as it is 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:57.510
 How close the curtain with a fluorescent light car and fluorescent shirt 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:02.040
 Even under the sun, UV rays come out, so if you leave this as it is, you will go on sightseeing more and more 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:06.630
 So be sure to put it in the box 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:09.690
 It's a nine-bag bag, so I'm already a professional of one king 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.760
 So please be sure to keep it in 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.620
 To an environment which is not provided anymore 4 times students 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.560
 Because 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.160
 Please do 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.160
 I will not 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.930
 Ranne- 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:30.930
 Please de dash place had been home actually use only a minute in this state 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:40.340
 Then it is a storage place of the exposure helm, but it is good inside of such a graph mouth 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.830
 Well, I can not enter that refrigerator or something 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:47.000
 Please and please a good save Never put even dress word in reverse 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:53.000
 Is there in him 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:00.250
 It feels like this-if you do n't take it in direct sunlight or humidity 1 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.250
 Please be stored at such location in the is completely okay one and a half years from the year
