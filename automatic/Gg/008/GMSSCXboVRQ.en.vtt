00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.639

 including asking for the car you'd like to see 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.329
 on the track with marcelo and that's where we go now pest as behaves 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.489
 the audi a6 the full style and with a powerful v6 engine under the hood beauty 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 they 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.800
 not only 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.130
 W 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.930
 model for the three executives but also for those who require a little 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.370
 plus the case of all this we find the audi a6 sportsmanship and also a 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.900
 beautiful set for those who like to accelerate 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.770

 she and now I invite you to the botafogo and commercial of these three points to the port 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 such as 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.160
 this is the renewed version of the brothel arrived in Brazil at the end of the first 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.430
 half of this year are almost being opened but when you 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.899
 the steering wheel also perceives this size all because it is a car thank you very much 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.780
 in this new generation are changes in the design that made it more modern and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.630
 more sporty 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.799
 the sobriety I'm leaving thanks to the monocle magazine set of headlights 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.910
 bi-xenon 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.740
 integrated light stroke for 100 years 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.090
 and mainly 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.030
 the lower suspension and the rim wheels 18 fitted with low profile tires 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.559
 v 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.419
 bush 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.299
 geek 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.930
 I gave the deputy yesterday the space and what is expected of a luxury sedan 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.429
 from your party 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.750
 ass next is the flawed multimedia system 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.590
 that centralize the command of the main equipment as I am conditioned 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.180
 board computer 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.269
 phone, among others 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.839
 the 7-inch panel display 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.639
 showed that the system is important the audi parking system plus which gives a 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.639
 good help at the time of parking maneuvers 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.609
 but the equipment list is long 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.360
 to 6 010 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.150
 brakes with abs system speed control the interesting system that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.430
 allows you to determine distance if you want to keep the car at your 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.219
 front 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.850
 it's very easy to operate 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.850
 by means of a lever behind the steering wheel 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.300
 I'm back more pain than being hot. 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.930
 very well accompanied by an enviable mechanic under the hood the a6 behind another 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.310
 three points 0 v6 of 290 horses which has 42 points 9 kilograms per branch of 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.790
 vote and which is already available from the 2800 data 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:36.859
 also features a refined quattro all-wheel drive set 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.029
 audi which causes the car to remain crowded on the floor 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.870
 to facilitate the work of v6 the transmission is of six 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.760
 speeds 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.230
 with possibility of change in the fins behind the steering wheel but is option mode 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.930
 sport 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.930
 which further fuels the responses of the car 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:06.699
 As I am a faulty server with 6 2º accelerating the process creeps there are 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:07.930

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.909

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.270
 It's a car made executive It's clear that executives who like to have baby 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.349
