00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
harvested on this side and I'm letting

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.020 
harvested on this side and I'm letting
them<00:01:57.479> regrow<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.560> after<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.490> germinate<00:01:59.850> your

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
them regrow so after you germinate your

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520 
them regrow so after you germinate your
cilantro<00:02:00.479> seeds<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.350> ahead

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
cilantro seeds you're going to go ahead

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300 
cilantro seeds you're going to go ahead
and<00:02:01.679> put<00:02:01.829> them<00:02:01.920> right<00:02:02.310> inside<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.619> hydrogen

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and put them right inside the hydrogen

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.990 
and put them right inside the hydrogen
media<00:02:07.489> that<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:10.619> say

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
media that this is about I would say

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.670

let's<00:02:12.000> say<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.269> about<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> month<00:02:12.810> old<00:02:13.230> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
let's say it's about a month old and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.880 
let's say it's about a month old and
I've<00:02:14.550> already<00:02:14.730> harvested<00:02:15.330> these<00:02:15.480> once<00:02:15.890> but

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
I've already harvested these once but

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.680 
I've already harvested these once but

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
things that people don't know sometimes

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.259 
things that people don't know sometimes
people<00:02:20.310> will<00:02:20.519> pull<00:02:20.730> them<00:02:20.819> all<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> way<00:02:21.239> out

people will pull them all the way out

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.070 
people will pull them all the way out
and<00:02:21.860> kill<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.340> root<00:02:23.489> system<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.120> what's<00:02:25.019> very

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and kill the root system but what's very

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.949 
and kill the root system but what's very
important<00:02:25.769> as<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.330> one<00:02:27.569> here

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
important as you see in this one here

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.750 
important as you see in this one here
you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.650> go<00:02:28.799> through<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.220> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.489> trim

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
you can just go through and kind of trim

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.180 
you can just go through and kind of trim
it<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:30.030> grass<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.500> get<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:31.950> these

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
it like grass and then you get all these

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.710 
it like grass and then you get all these
new<00:02:32.580> sprouts<00:02:33.000> down<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.959> will<00:02:34.049> come<00:02:34.290> up

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
new sprouts down here that will come up

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.479 
new sprouts down here that will come up
doing<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:37.019> this<00:02:37.260> I've<00:02:37.739> done<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.340> to

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
doing it like this I've done it up to

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.610 
doing it like this I've done it up to
six<00:02:38.730> times<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.480> noticed<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.019> once<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.380> start

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
six times I noticed that once you start

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.130 
six times I noticed that once you start
trimming<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.130> whole<00:02:41.280> lot<00:02:41.489> sometimes<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.989> can

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
trimming it a whole lot sometimes it can

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.009 
trimming it a whole lot sometimes it can
not<00:02:46.140> come<00:02:47.130> back<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:47.579> easily<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.630> seems<00:02:48.840> like

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
not come back as easily it seems like

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.900 
not come back as easily it seems like
they<00:02:49.140> lose<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.349> little<00:02:49.709> bit<00:02:49.859> of<00:02:49.980> their<00:02:50.130> their

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
they lose a little bit of their their

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.640 
they lose a little bit of their their
strength<00:02:51.420> every<00:02:51.780> time<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.200> cut<00:02:52.350> them<00:02:52.470> down

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
strength every time you cut them down

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
strength every time you cut them down
but<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> most<00:02:53.609> part<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:54.030> sure<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.420> can

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
but for the most part I'm sure you can

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.840 
but for the most part I'm sure you can
keep<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:54.870> year<00:02:55.650> around<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.609> I'll<00:02:56.700> just

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850

show you real quick on one plant how to

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.129 
show you real quick on one plant how to

whole lot of cilantro if you did a large

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.480 
whole lot of cilantro if you did a large

system that's 2.5 by 2.5 foot like I'm

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.820 
system that's 2.5 by 2.5 foot like I'm
running<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:49.390> could<00:04:49.540> easily<00:04:49.810> get<00:04:50.290> this<00:04:50.560> much

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
running you could easily get this much

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.090 
running you could easily get this much
every<00:04:51.490> week<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.320> they<00:04:53.320> don't<00:04:53.350> require<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.860> lot

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
every week and they don't require a lot

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.010 
every week and they don't require a lot
of<00:04:54.190> light<00:04:54.370> down<00:04:54.910> Lee<00:04:55.060> require<00:04:55.390> about<00:04:55.630> three

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
of light down Lee require about three

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.530 
of light down Lee require about three
hours<00:04:56.200> of<00:04:56.380> sunlight<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:58.210> means<00:04:58.360> you

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
hours of sunlight and so that means you

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.320 
hours of sunlight and so that means you
can<00:04:58.750> use<00:04:58.900> just<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.500> CFL<00:05:00.280> bulb<00:05:00.660> from<00:05:01.660> Home<00:05:02.590> Depot

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
to be doing another video on basil so we

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.760 
to be doing another video on basil so we
won't<00:06:53.060> talk<00:06:53.120> much<00:06:53.569> about<00:06:53.719> this<00:06:54.050> but<00:06:54.499> I'll<00:06:54.620> show

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
won't talk much about this but I'll show

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.350 
won't talk much about this but I'll show

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
to do a hydroponic basil but anyways 250

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.070 
to do a hydroponic basil but anyways 250
to<00:07:00.469> start<00:07:00.740> when<00:07:00.949> they're<00:07:01.069> seedlings<00:07:01.599> okay<00:07:02.599> and

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
to start when they're seedlings okay and

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.839 
to start when they're seedlings okay and
I<00:07:03.169> mean<00:07:03.409> they<00:07:04.069> need<00:07:04.219> to<00:07:04.279> be<00:07:04.370> a<00:07:04.399> couple<00:07:04.580> inches

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
I mean they need to be a couple inches

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.920 
I mean they need to be a couple inches
about<00:07:05.240> two<00:07:05.750> inches<00:07:06.110> and<00:07:07.210> then<00:07:08.210> after<00:07:08.539> that<00:07:08.689> you

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
about two inches and then after that you

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.050 
about two inches and then after that you
can<00:07:08.960> raise<00:07:09.229> them<00:07:09.409> up<00:07:09.439> to<00:07:09.589> 500<00:07:10.159> ppm<00:07:10.580> running

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
can raise them up to 500 ppm running

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.490 
can raise them up to 500 ppm running
equal<00:07:11.509> parts<00:07:11.930> of<00:07:12.250> flora<00:07:13.250> grow<00:07:13.819> and<00:07:14.240> micro<00:07:14.599> okay

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
equal parts of flora grow and micro okay

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.670 
equal parts of flora grow and micro okay
