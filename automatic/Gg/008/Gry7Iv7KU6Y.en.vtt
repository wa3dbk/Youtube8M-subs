into consideration I don't think that'll

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.600 
into consideration I don't think that'll
be<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.840> bigger<00:06:14.530> problem<00:06:14.800> cuz<00:06:15.009> I<00:06:15.099> think<00:06:15.250> the

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
what would have been the best results

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.939 
what would have been the best results
from<00:06:39.969> England's<00:06:40.360> point<00:06:40.630> of<00:06:40.750> view<00:06:40.900> I<00:06:41.110> don't<00:06:41.590> see

from England's point of view I don't see

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.200 
from England's point of view I don't see
like<00:06:41.979> to<00:06:42.280> worry<00:06:42.460> about<00:06:42.729> it<00:06:42.880> I<00:06:42.940> think<00:06:43.090> they've

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
like to worry about it I think they've

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.550 
like to worry about it I think they've
got<00:06:43.330> to<00:06:43.419> concentrate<00:06:43.750> on<00:06:44.110> winning<00:06:44.229> their<00:06:44.530> game

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560

got to concentrate on winning their game
you<00:06:45.310> know<00:06:45.460> whatever

you know whatever

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.000 
you know whatever
in<00:06:46.790> the<00:06:46.910> other<00:06:47.030> where<00:06:47.390> any<00:06:48.260> other<00:06:48.290> matches<00:06:48.860> is

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
in the other where any other matches is

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.090 
in the other where any other matches is
irrelevant<00:06:49.310> really<00:06:50.350> you've<00:06:51.350> got<00:06:51.410> a<00:06:51.560> focus<00:06:51.950> on

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
irrelevant really you've got a focus on

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.260

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
winning your matches and there nothing

else<00:06:53.510> matters<00:06:54.020> and<00:06:54.350> I<00:06:54.410> think<00:06:54.620> as<00:06:54.710> a<00:06:54.740> player<00:06:55.070> is

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
else matters and I think as a player is

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.040 
else matters and I think as a player is
quite<00:06:55.520> important<00:06:56.030> for<00:06:56.150> England<00:06:56.660> the<00:06:56.840> fact

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
quite important for England the fact

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.630 
quite important for England the fact
that<00:06:57.140> if<00:06:57.560> they<00:06:57.770> don't<00:06:57.890> know<00:06:58.100> the<00:06:58.220> result<00:06:58.550> of

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
that if they don't know the result of

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.040 
that if they don't know the result of
this<00:06:58.730> game<00:06:58.970> so<00:06:59.210> they<00:06:59.540> will<00:06:59.690> not<00:06:59.840> have<00:07:00.020> any

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
this game so they will not have any

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.720 
this game so they will not have any
options<00:07:00.560> they<00:07:00.980> just<00:07:01.190> want<00:07:01.340> to<00:07:01.370> go<00:07:01.490> to<00:07:01.550> the

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
options they just want to go to the

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.010 
options they just want to go to the
pitch<00:07:01.910> and<00:07:02.120> try<00:07:02.210> to<00:07:02.300> win<00:07:02.540> the<00:07:02.660> game<00:07:02.690> and<00:07:02.960> I

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
pitch and try to win the game and I

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.330 
pitch and try to win the game and I
think<00:07:03.200> that<00:07:03.290> can<00:07:03.440> be<00:07:03.620> a<00:07:03.650> good<00:07:03.800> site<00:07:04.010> for<00:07:04.190> them

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
think that can be a good site for them

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.670 
think that can be a good site for them
yeah<00:07:04.790> and<00:07:05.120> for<00:07:05.390> you<00:07:05.540> crying<00:07:05.870> we'll<00:07:06.470> have<00:07:06.650> a

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
yeah and for you crying we'll have a

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.730 
yeah and for you crying we'll have a
days<00:07:06.920> less<00:07:07.160> preparation<00:07:07.520> I<00:07:08.470> can<00:07:09.470> end<00:07:09.650> up

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
days less preparation I can end up

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.490 
days less preparation I can end up
blaming<00:07:09.890> the<00:07:10.160> wrong<00:07:10.250> weather<00:07:10.520> camera<00:07:10.820> if<00:07:11.500> it

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
blaming the wrong weather camera if it

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.930 
blaming the wrong weather camera if it
didn't<00:07:12.710> go<00:07:12.800> well<00:07:12.830> for<00:07:13.190> him<00:07:13.280> against<00:07:13.640> England

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
didn't go well for him against England

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:21.310 
didn't go well for him against England
no<00:07:14.660> I<00:07:15.410> think<00:07:15.800> they've<00:07:19.060> been<00:07:20.060> very<00:07:20.450> unlikely

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
no I think they've been very unlikely

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.050 
no I think they've been very unlikely
all<00:07:21.560> of<00:07:21.740> the<00:07:21.800> supporters<00:07:22.370> perhaps<00:07:22.670> can<00:07:22.880> get

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
all of the supporters perhaps can get

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.020 
all of the supporters perhaps can get
there<00:07:23.270> in<00:07:23.480> tomorrow<00:07:23.840> but<00:07:24.110> that<00:07:24.790> that's<00:07:25.790> what

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.030 
there in tomorrow but that that's what

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.160 
there in tomorrow but that that's what
they'd<00:07:26.150> have<00:07:26.330> to<00:07:26.480> do<00:07:26.630> you<00:07:26.810> know<00:07:26.930> they'd<00:07:27.080> have

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
they'd have to do you know they'd have

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.260 
they'd have to do you know they'd have

to put it back with 24 hours so I can't

to put it back with 24 hours so I can't
remember<00:07:29.950> somebody<00:07:30.950> might<00:07:31.130> know<00:07:31.340> in<00:07:31.490> there

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670
