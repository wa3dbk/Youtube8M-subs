00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.339
 We're back with the passing of time. 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.329
 when he talks about the possibility of life on other planets 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.550
 in this blog you accompanied the walk of science the pursuit of life 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.930
 extraterrestrial we are closer 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.179
 answer the question 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.989
 we do for thousands of years 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.230
 see the report 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.610
 when we look at the sky 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.659
 we have an untold amount of stars 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.019
 many of them North American thousands of light-years from here 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.070
 but do we have the real notion in the immensity of the universe 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.080
 universe do you think there are how many planets in the universe point 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.710
 in the text of this 9-10 session intimate 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.810
 the recipe guides 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.320
 of the 800 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.770
 6 billion 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.180
 billion 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.020
 commercial property 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.620
 in fact only about 200 planets were identified 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.530
 outside the solar system all of them in the last decade however the number of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.240
 planets that exist in the universe is something really impossible to measure 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.540
 With so many worlds still to be discovered, we ask, will it be 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.070
 there is life on other planets but we have not found it yet 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.410
 I think there should be life life possibility of your fans 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.940
 he has to believe 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.270
 I think it's possible, yes. 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.760
 same way that happened in check because of the environment that we have 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.500
 on here 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 I believe not only that she begged to be avoided 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.000
 comment here only yesterday 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.490
 I think so 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.340
 I'll say yes that he has talent is a disease in which the person comes and from these 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.790
 places came people told me to give 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.230
 noted that one of the scientists who believe it is possible to find life 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.090
 intelligent 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.040
 on other planets 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.830
 the American scientist author of color hands the best-selling scientific book 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.750
 of all time even elaborated an equation to justify the point of 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.620
 view from him 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.120
 he considers for the calculations the fraction of the stars that he possesses 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.090
 planets 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.310
 of the storms in which there was indeed going to arise and even the duration 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.419
 of this possible civilization 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:17.089
 Most fishermen nowadays think that life can exist outside the land. 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.339
 when you have 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.979
 is a small chance 'of some event to happen 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.229
 but it only occurs many many times 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.509
 In the plot he posed himself. 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.699
 it may occur 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.870
 we find time on the wing it says action our intelligent activity 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.189
 already occurred once 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.159
 twice the whole group 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.659
 it's not an absurd amount 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 can be 10 with 21 tries without 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.459
 then closer and closer to finding stele 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.309
 by the planet as well as the system 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.709
 will be the decision of the four deaths on a planet pandora of a star 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.529
 neighbor 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.529
 it would be possible to see the land that our civilization 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.890
 if there was a civilization like ours with a telescope 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.880
 is start caps-ad we who next stars in terms of art them 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.440
 they were able to observe is only we have been so jupiter nowadays with 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.699
 the techniques we have 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.099
 and perhaps beyond the kinship shift 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.969
 because this issue is sensitive in this respect yet it is 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.269
 these as the earth 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.600
 with this answer 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.990
 we realize that perhaps the ground attacks here are paralyzed with 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.200
 the movie ter may not be mere fiction and who knows are on an equal planet 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.839
 the land 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:39.629
 closer than we imagine
