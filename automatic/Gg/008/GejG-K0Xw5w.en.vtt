00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
camcorder on to the pistol grip and as

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260 
camcorder on to the pistol grip and as
you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.770> film<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you can see I can just film with the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.840 
you can see I can just film with the
pistol<00:01:54.540> grip<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> without<00:01:56.340> actually

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pistol grip on and without actually

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.359 
pistol grip on and without actually
having<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.240> hold<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> camera<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
having to hold the camera in the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.639 
having to hold the camera in the
traditional<00:01:59.939> position<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.780> holding<00:02:01.229> cameras

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
traditional position of holding cameras

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.399 
traditional position of holding cameras
so<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.610> pistol<00:02:02.939> grip<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.659> nice<00:02:03.840> for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so the pistol grip is really nice for

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
so the pistol grip is really nice for
just<00:02:04.439> filming<00:02:05.130> videos<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> getting<00:02:05.969> steady

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
just filming videos and getting steady

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
just filming videos and getting steady
video<00:02:06.780> shots<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
video shots so as you can see it is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.420 
video shots so as you can see it is
tightly<00:02:09.149> mounted<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.379> tripod<00:02:10.979> mount<00:02:11.220> on

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
tightly mounted to the tripod mount on

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.500 
tightly mounted to the tripod mount on
the<00:02:11.550> top<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.150> came'<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:12.989> fall

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the top so you came' will not fall

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.190 
the top so you came' will not fall
out<00:02:13.599> when<00:02:14.049> filming<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:16.510> bottom<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:17.019> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
out when filming on the bottom of the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.289 
out when filming on the bottom of the
pistol<00:02:17.560> grip<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.920> has<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.400> ring<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> can

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
pistol grip it has a ring so you can

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.140 
pistol grip it has a ring so you can
attach<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.840> your<00:02:20.140> bag<00:02:20.739> when<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> unloosen

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
attach it to your bag when I unloosen

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.500 
attach it to your bag when I unloosen
the<00:02:22.329> ring<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.870> has<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.939> tripod<00:02:24.939> mount<00:02:25.180> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
the ring it has this tripod mount so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.660 
the ring it has this tripod mount so
what<00:02:25.689> this<00:02:25.810> allows<00:02:25.870> me<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.470> do<00:02:26.769> is<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.310> can

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
what this allows me to do is that I can

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.809 
what this allows me to do is that I can
attach<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.329> friction<00:02:29.260> arm<00:02:29.500> onto<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.190> pistol

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
attach my friction arm onto the pistol

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.240 
attach my friction arm onto the pistol
grip<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.569> adjustable<00:02:32.200> friction<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.829> came

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
grip so the adjustable friction on came

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.180 
grip so the adjustable friction on came
with<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.760> Pico<00:02:34.180> dolly<00:02:34.420> few<00:02:35.140> weeks<00:02:35.319> ago<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.159> I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
with the Pico dolly few weeks ago so I

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.220 
with the Pico dolly few weeks ago so I
can<00:02:36.459> attach<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.480> pistol<00:02:37.840> grip<00:02:37.870> and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
can attach it to the pistol grip and

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.369 
can attach it to the pistol grip and
basically<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.430> attach<00:02:39.909> my<00:02:40.180> camera<00:02:40.659> another

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
basically I can attach my camera another

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.399 
basically I can attach my camera another
camera<00:02:41.799> onto<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.609> arm<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.689> can<00:02:43.840> also<00:02:43.989> attach

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
camera onto the arm you can also attach

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.280 
camera onto the arm you can also attach
a<00:02:44.709> light<00:02:44.950> or<00:02:45.159> a<00:02:45.250> microphone<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.959> arm

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
a light or a microphone on to the arm

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.680 
a light or a microphone on to the arm
but<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.099> don't<00:02:48.400> have<00:02:48.549> a<00:02:48.579> microphone<00:02:48.909> or<00:02:49.359> light

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
but I don't have a microphone or light

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.259 
but I don't have a microphone or light
so<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.560> use<00:02:50.799> my<00:02:50.829> other<00:02:51.190> camcorder<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
so I just use my other camcorder to

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.080 
so I just use my other camcorder to
demonstrate<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.579> I'm<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:54.849> sure

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
demonstrate this to you so I'm not sure

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.330 
demonstrate this to you so I'm not sure
how<00:02:55.299> this<00:02:55.569> might<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:56.049> useful<00:02:56.409> for<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.159> if

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
how this might be useful for you but if

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.910 
how this might be useful for you but if
you<00:02:57.459> want<00:02:57.639> to<00:02:57.819> film<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.359> to<00:02:59.139> footage<00:02:59.530> video

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
you want to film like to footage video

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.039 
you want to film like to footage video
footage<00:03:00.280> at<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.700> same<00:03:00.940> time<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.810> might

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
footage at the same time this might

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.289 
footage at the same time this might
become<00:03:02.290> useful<00:03:02.739> for<00:03:03.129> you<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:04.030> is

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
become useful for you so this is

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.750 
become useful for you so this is
basically<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:05.139> review<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.340> pistol<00:03:06.730> grip

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
basically my review of the pistol grip

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.119 
basically my review of the pistol grip
it<00:03:07.389> basically<00:03:07.569> allows<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.500> film<00:03:08.769> steady

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
it basically allows you to film steady

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.580 
it basically allows you to film steady
video<00:03:09.489> footage<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.780> entire<00:03:10.930> out<00:03:11.379> to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
video footage and this entire out to

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.809 
video footage and this entire out to
your<00:03:11.739> hand<00:03:11.980> after<00:03:12.459> filming<00:03:12.849> for<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.120> long<00:03:13.299> time

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
your hand after filming for a long time

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.770 
your hand after filming for a long time
so<00:03:15.819> I'm<00:03:15.909> going<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.120> show<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.450> comparison

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
so I'm going to show you a comparison

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.150 
so I'm going to show you a comparison
video<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:18.030> filming<00:03:19.030> with<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.690> pistol<00:03:19.900> grip

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
video of filming with the pistol grip

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.009 
video of filming with the pistol grip
versus<00:03:21.160> without<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.819> pistol<00:03:22.209> grip<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.840> it's

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
versus without the pistol grip so it's

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.599 
versus without the pistol grip so it's
not<00:03:23.079> a<00:03:23.199> really<00:03:23.500> big<00:03:23.799> difference<00:03:23.949> you're<00:03:24.430> not

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
not a really big difference you're not

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.759 
not a really big difference you're not
going<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.849> notice<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.359> huge<00:03:25.840> difference<00:03:25.959> you're

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
going to notice a huge difference you're

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.559 
going to notice a huge difference you're
not<00:03:26.919> only<00:03:27.129> going<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.489> achieve<00:03:27.609> steady<00:03:28.239> video

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
not only going to achieve steady video

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.599 
not only going to achieve steady video
footage<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:29.079> you're<00:03:29.470> also<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.859> going<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.400> have

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
footage is you're also not going to have

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.659 
footage is you're also not going to have
