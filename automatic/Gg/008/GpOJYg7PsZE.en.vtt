00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.740 
it distributes evenly
and<00:04:17.160> what<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.310> want<00:04:18.520> on<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.420> want<00:04:19.570> it

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
and what you want on on it you want it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.030 
and what you want on on it you want it
to<00:04:20.050> look<00:04:20.709> like<00:04:20.770> it's<00:04:21.340> snowed<00:04:21.700> on<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:26.010> with<00:04:27.010> a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
to look like it's snowed on it with a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.890 
to look like it's snowed on it with a
salt<00:04:29.490> then<00:04:30.490> what<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.670> do<00:04:30.790> is<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.270> take<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.510> pepper

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
salt then what I do is I take the pepper

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.390 
salt then what I do is I take the pepper
and<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:33.460> do<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.850> same<00:04:34.090> way<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:38.400> sprinkle

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
and I do it the same way and sprinkle

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:48.390 
and I do it the same way and sprinkle
the<00:04:39.490> pepper<00:04:39.730> on<00:04:40.030> it

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.790 

I<00:04:48.460> forgot<00:04:49.240> something<00:04:49.600> else<00:04:49.660> real<00:04:50.440> important

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
I forgot something else real important

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.760 
I forgot something else real important
step<00:04:51.040> one<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.490> what<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.699> forgot<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.060> tell<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.449> is

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
step one of what I forgot to tell you is

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.159 
step one of what I forgot to tell you is
when<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.800> first<00:04:54.430> get<00:04:54.580> these<00:04:54.790> steaks<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.509> always

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
when I first get these steaks I always

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.779 
when I first get these steaks I always
rinse<00:04:56.380> them<00:04:56.590> off<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:58.860> get<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.979> bone<00:05:00.190> fragments

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
rinse them off to get the bone fragments

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.249 
rinse them off to get the bone fragments
whatever<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.389> from<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.750> blade<00:05:02.020> off

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
whatever it is from the blade off

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.960 
whatever it is from the blade off
because<00:05:02.919> you<00:05:03.070> don't<00:05:03.250> want<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:03.460> bite<00:05:03.610> into<00:05:03.820> a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
because you don't want to bite into a

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.390 
because you don't want to bite into a
little<00:05:04.240> bone<00:05:04.509> fragment<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:05.320> have<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.919> sticky

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
little bone fragment and have it sticky

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.219 
little bone fragment and have it sticky
because<00:05:06.910> I've<00:05:07.030> had<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.389> happen<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.960> me<00:05:08.110> and

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
because I've had that happen to me and

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.360 
because I've had that happen to me and
it's<00:05:08.350> not<00:05:08.470> very<00:05:08.710> pleasant

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
it's not very pleasant

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.450 
it's not very pleasant
so<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:10.210> always<00:05:10.870> watch<00:05:11.229> them<00:05:11.410> wash<00:05:12.130> them<00:05:12.340> off

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
so I always watch them wash them off

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.820 
so I always watch them wash them off
first<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.090> then<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:13.960> Pat<00:05:14.229> them<00:05:14.410> dry<00:05:14.560> with<00:05:14.650> a

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
first and then I Pat them dry with a

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.790 
first and then I Pat them dry with a
paper<00:05:14.889> towel<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:16.110> you<00:05:17.110> don't<00:05:17.289> have<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.650> do

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
paper towel and you don't have to do

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.189 
paper towel and you don't have to do
that<00:05:17.979> but<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:18.370> do<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.759> because<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.900> don't<00:05:20.080> know

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
that but I do it because you don't know

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.550 
that but I do it because you don't know
what<00:05:20.410> your<00:05:20.560> butchers<00:05:20.949> done<00:05:22.199> with<00:05:23.199> it<00:05:23.380> or

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
what your butchers done with it or

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.920 
what your butchers done with it or
anything<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.910> this<00:05:25.180> way<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.419> get<00:05:25.660> all<00:05:25.690> the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
anything and this way you get all the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.870 
anything and this way you get all the
bone<00:05:26.169> fragments<00:05:26.800> out<00:05:26.979> unless<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.639> only

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
bone fragments out unless the only

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.460 
bone fragments out unless the only
reason<00:05:28.120> why<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.300> do<00:05:28.389> it<00:05:28.630> is<00:05:28.720> just<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.199> get<00:05:29.320> the

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
reason why I do it is just to get the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.460 
reason why I do it is just to get the
bone<00:05:29.620> fragments<00:05:33.720> okay<00:05:34.720> got<00:05:34.930> these<00:05:35.110> taller

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
bone fragments okay got these taller

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.350 
bone fragments okay got these taller
than<00:05:35.710> one<00:05:35.919> side<00:05:36.220> what<00:05:36.850> I'm<00:05:36.940> going<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.120> do<00:05:37.240> it

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
than one side what I'm going to do it

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.279 
than one side what I'm going to do it
just<00:05:37.389> turn<00:05:37.780> them<00:05:37.900> over<00:05:39.510> I'm<00:05:40.510> gonna<00:05:40.870> salt<00:05:41.169> up

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
just turn them over I'm gonna salt up

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:54.340 
just turn them over I'm gonna salt up
the<00:05:41.500> other<00:05:41.830> side<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.190> pepper<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.760> up

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.760 

I<00:05:54.440> found<00:05:55.190> that<00:05:55.310> kosher<00:05:55.700> salt<00:05:56.300> works<00:05:56.630> real<00:05:57.530> good

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
I found that kosher salt works real good

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:10.060

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
second part this this probably being

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.020
