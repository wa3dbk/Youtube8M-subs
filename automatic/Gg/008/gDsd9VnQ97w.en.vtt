00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
that the work is a lot easier once the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.350 
that the work is a lot easier once the
race<00:01:14.320> oblique<00:01:14.620> aynd<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.920> wears<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.400> it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
race oblique aynd of wears out it

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.230 
race oblique aynd of wears out it
becomes<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:17.140> lot<00:01:17.500> trickier<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:19.000> we're<00:01:19.210> just

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
becomes a lot trickier but we're just

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.350 
becomes a lot trickier but we're just
rotating<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.350> hard<00:01:20.770> post<00:01:20.979> out<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.490> taking

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
once you've got those four ridges it's

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.950 
once you've got those four ridges it's
already<00:01:30.220> starting<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.670> get<00:01:30.790> round<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.720> just

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
gradual radiation there and we build a

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.310 
gradual radiation there and we build a
nice<00:01:52.150> pile<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.930> shavings<00:01:54.900> as<00:01:55.900> we<00:01:56.170> do<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:58.320> so
