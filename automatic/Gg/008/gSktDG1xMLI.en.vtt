my<00:01:54.570> culinary<00:01:54.810> school<00:01:55.399> blackstrap<00:01:56.399> molasses

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
my culinary school blackstrap molasses

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
my culinary school blackstrap molasses
is<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.500> when

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
is actually what they take off when

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.139 
is actually what they take off when
they're<00:01:58.799> processing<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.460> sugar<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.909> kind

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
they're processing the sugar it's kind

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.550 
they're processing the sugar it's kind
of<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> byproducts<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.350> usually

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of like the byproducts and they usually

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
of like the byproducts and they usually
get<00:02:01.829> rid<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.789> it's<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.119> where<00:02:03.329> all

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
get rid of it but it's really where all

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.779 
get rid of it but it's really where all
the<00:02:03.600> nutrients<00:02:04.049> lie<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.310> best<00:02:05.579> source

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
the nutrients lie it's the best source

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.060 
the nutrients lie it's the best source
of<00:02:05.909> iron<00:02:06.090> even<00:02:06.600> better<00:02:06.750> than<00:02:06.960> red<00:02:07.200> meat<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
of iron even better than red meat but it

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.090 
of iron even better than red meat but it
is<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> non-heme<00:02:08.789> iron<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.930> need<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.619> vitamin

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
is a non-heme iron so you need a vitamin

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.860 
is a non-heme iron so you need a vitamin
C<00:02:11.280> source<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> help<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:11.970> absorption<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
C source to help with the absorption and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.090 
C source to help with the absorption and
that's<00:02:13.230> where<00:02:13.470> my<00:02:13.590> next<00:02:13.650> ingredient<00:02:14.310> comes<00:02:14.490> in

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
that's where my next ingredient comes in

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.220 
that's where my next ingredient comes in
i'm<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.580> use<00:02:15.700> chocolate<00:02:16.300> mint<00:02:16.690> leaves<00:02:16.900> i

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
i'm going to use chocolate mint leaves i

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.140 
i'm going to use chocolate mint leaves i
think<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.070> make<00:02:18.280> these<00:02:18.460> by<00:02:18.670> actually

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
think they make these by actually

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.410 
think they make these by actually
planting<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.930> mint<00:02:20.340> seed<00:02:21.340> with<00:02:21.700> chocolate

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
planting the mint seed with chocolate

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.530 
planting the mint seed with chocolate
yeah<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.830> actually<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.580> don't<00:02:24.850> know<00:02:24.970> but

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
yeah that's it actually I don't know but

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.300 
yeah that's it actually I don't know but
they<00:02:25.720> do<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.350> little<00:02:26.680> bit<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:27.010> chocolate

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
they do have a little bit of a chocolate

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.070 
they do have a little bit of a chocolate
fragrance<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.150> what<00:02:28.330> they<00:02:28.480> really<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:28.900> they

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
fragrance but what they really do they

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.260 
fragrance but what they really do they
there<00:02:29.590> are<00:02:29.650> more<00:02:29.800> minty<00:02:30.280> flavor<00:02:30.460> I<00:02:30.940> think<00:02:31.150> they

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
there are more minty flavor I think they

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.940 
there are more minty flavor I think they
were<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.750> much<00:02:31.870> better<00:02:31.930> than<00:02:32.320> regular<00:02:32.560> mint

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
were so much better than regular mint

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.890 
were so much better than regular mint
leaves<00:02:33.100> if<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.940> find<00:02:34.120> them<00:02:34.360> please<00:02:34.690> use

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
leaves if you can find them please use

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.270 
leaves if you can find them please use
them<00:02:35.080> they're<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.410> bit<00:02:35.620> thinner<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.250> i

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
them they're a little bit thinner so i

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.950 
them they're a little bit thinner so i
don't<00:02:36.490> have<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.610> cut<00:02:36.880> them<00:02:37.060> up<00:02:37.210> but<00:02:37.780> if<00:02:37.870> you're

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
don't have to cut them up but if you're

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.230 
don't have to cut them up but if you're
using<00:02:38.170> regular<00:02:38.740> mint<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.970> little<00:02:40.090> bit

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
using regular mint and it's a little bit

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.150 
using regular mint and it's a little bit
thicker<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.930> want<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.200> take<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.830> easy<00:02:42.040> on

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
thicker and you want to take it easy on

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.620 
thicker and you want to take it easy on
your<00:02:42.340> blender<00:02:42.670> then<00:02:42.790> take<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.300> mint<00:02:43.480> leaves

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
your blender then take the mint leaves

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.510 
your blender then take the mint leaves
and<00:02:43.720> stack<00:02:44.080> them<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:45.130> what's<00:02:45.250> called<00:02:45.400> a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
and stack them and do what's called a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.250 
and stack them and do what's called a
shipping<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:46.030> where<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:46.330> chop<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.900> mint<00:02:47.110> into

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
shipping on where you chop the mint into

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.620 
shipping on where you chop the mint into
small<00:02:47.710> ribbons<00:02:48.100> pieces<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.450> learning

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
small ribbons pieces and just learning

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.090 
small ribbons pieces and just learning
that<00:02:49.810> technique<00:02:50.170> means<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.710> can<00:02:50.890> use

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
that technique means that you can use

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.310 
that technique means that you can use
mint<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:51.760> many<00:02:51.910> ways<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.690> wonderful<00:02:53.020> on

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
mint in so many ways it's wonderful on

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.800 
mint in so many ways it's wonderful on
fruit<00:02:53.560> salads<00:02:54.040> or<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.310> grain<00:02:54.580> dishes<00:02:55.120> or<00:02:55.360> in

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
fruit salads or in grain dishes or in

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.990 
fruit salads or in grain dishes or in
regular<00:02:56.230> salad<00:02:56.500> as<00:02:56.800> such<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> great<00:02:57.430> flavor<00:02:57.640> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
regular salad as such a great flavor and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.850 
regular salad as such a great flavor and
then<00:02:58.660> we're<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.960> add<00:02:59.020> some<00:02:59.290> cinnamon<00:02:59.530> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
then we're going to add some cinnamon a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.440 
then we're going to add some cinnamon a
lot<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.310> health<00:03:00.490> benefits<00:03:00.910> with<00:03:01.060> cinnamon

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
lot of health benefits with cinnamon

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.270 
lot of health benefits with cinnamon
even<00:03:01.840> adding<00:03:02.260> some<00:03:02.500> fiber<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.160> some

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
even adding some fiber and some

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.880 
even adding some fiber and some
antioxidants<00:03:04.290> antacids<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.410> actually<00:03:05.740> come

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
antioxidants antacids are actually come

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.840 
antioxidants antacids are actually come
in<00:03:05.980> almost<00:03:06.160> all<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.610> our<00:03:06.700> ingredients

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
in almost all of our ingredients

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.000 
in almost all of our ingredients
especially<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.930> next<00:03:08.200> one<00:03:08.350> which<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.530> cocoa

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
especially the next one which is cocoa

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.130 
especially the next one which is cocoa
powder<00:03:09.280> we're<00:03:09.880> using<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.180> tablespoon<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.840> dark

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
antioxidant called a cata chin it's like

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.500 
antioxidant called a cata chin it's like
what<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.270> find<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.750> tea<00:03:17.050> red<00:03:17.470> wine<00:03:17.550> apples<00:03:18.550> and

what you find in tea red wine apples and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.940 
what you find in tea red wine apples and
catatan<00:03:20.020> it's<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.350> another<00:03:20.590> class<00:03:20.920> of

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
catatan it's just another class of

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.040 
catatan it's just another class of
antioxidants<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:21.880> they<00:03:22.090> all<00:03:22.300> basically<00:03:22.570> work

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
antioxidants but they all basically work

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.380 
antioxidants but they all basically work
to<00:03:23.200> fight<00:03:23.440> disease<00:03:23.620> by<00:03:24.430> sculpting<00:03:25.000> out<00:03:25.120> free

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
to fight disease by sculpting out free

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.180 
to fight disease by sculpting out free
radicals<00:03:25.840> they<00:03:26.020> kind<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.350> like<00:03:26.500> sacrifice

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
radicals they kind of like sacrifice

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.130
