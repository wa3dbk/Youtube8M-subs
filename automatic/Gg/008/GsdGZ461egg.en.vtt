00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.730
 good gentlemen how are you doing and this is a 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.200
 tutorial 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.180
 get and place the different one is not 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.030
 good 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.120
 as you know I am playing a new 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.410
 server that I found more or less 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.330
 three weeks two weeks 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.090
 It's called very cute to see your way out 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.539
 private 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.419
 or fruit 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 an intellect that they handle what they want 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.559
 wake up what server I played 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.570
 is that it is the ass, that is, we are not going to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.960
 find rare assemblers and so take 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.850
 edited weapons 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 they are only official weapons 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 but only with only some 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.620
 facilities that servers have 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 that are not too many 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.000
 so let's go back to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.340
 for him 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 to explain 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.400
 good good although we are going to visit for 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.920
 get 51 751 as you see 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.920
 we just need small fish 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.110
 looking for a good drink 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.670
 or river sea of ​​the game 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.500
 we can buy the canes in the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.400
 legs that are usually close to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.140
 the sides of the fish 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.140
 together with him 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 he 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 good a turn once we already have 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.409
 the little one we're headed 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.409
 the first village of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.240
 his kingdom 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.060
 the Blues 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:58.040
 we just leave 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.460
 this would be the case with epic weapons 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 the epic interests 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.080
 so we need 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.360
 the true millions 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 and a little better 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.300
 happens and step by step we go again 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.160
 I give you a good example 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.840
 Wow 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.310
 Fortunately 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.930
 can fail as the whole does not place 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.569
 stone 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.230
 like that of the 7 also 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.140
 good we need 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.489
 you can compare some things and you 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.379
 can buy in stores of the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.920
 garages we have four winds 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:44.069
 trade winds of 800 gives us 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.129
 three hours we already have about 250 that we 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.390
 Give half an hour and place cheek 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.319
 half hour thief gloves like 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.319
 free value 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.200
 It gives me the luck it gives us 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.200
 plus 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.350
 to project 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.140
 32 charm modification that is for 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.020
 eat the face text of emotions with 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.280
 hamas 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.280
 the verbose beloki 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.880
 so we 're just going to need 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.850
 smaller smaller fish 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.850
 and we place them on 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.910
 East of Asia 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.910
 and simply 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:38.410
 we just have to have 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.410
 we place 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.510
 we just put it measurements 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.010
 we discard his life here we see that I have 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.010
 one of 4 we are going to try 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.840
 good with success and we believe that I have 52 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.840
 ensuring that the change strip 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.970
 my guild with a potato are all 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.970
 Welcome 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:18.670
 unite we join with a line 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:23.010
 as long as there are good friends the 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.010
 guests liked 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:32.150
 if you like to comment, think 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.150
 like with I like it a lot 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.540
 two 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.280
 my advice 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.280
 but they can not find
