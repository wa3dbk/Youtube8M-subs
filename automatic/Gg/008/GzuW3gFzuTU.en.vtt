00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.169
 r 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.169
 I am the creator of an opinion 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.999
 to start his business 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.789
 it seems to me 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.669
 it means that 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.880
 that person for a week 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.710
 to let flow in her the fountain of light of this divine presence 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 indoor 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 but that should not make that person useless - productive 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.070
 life this thrilling dictation and creativity 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.800
 whoever the only will of god 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.060
 if he exercised in him and serene buried 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060
 but also bubbling with ideas at the service of all 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.880
 in the human thought 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.900
 the light of God finally arrives at his child 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.140
 it results for the latter 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 a field of possibilities a movie 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
 imagination is a divine attribute 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.370
 which overflows when we discover the little voice of his heart 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.250
 whether it's writing 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.480
 the painting 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.760
 the sculpture 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.530
 and many other artistic activities 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.270
 the possibility of expressing God by his energy he estimates in this 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.150
 on the other hand when we understand that we are creators of our lives 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.300
 we can create our living conditions in both directions 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.660
 this balance 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.100
 Discord 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770
 where the harmony 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.050
 for example 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 we can complain about our living conditions 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.170
 for just the opposite to understand that we are putting it to each 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.030
 moment of this life 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.509
 and so placed in our precious existence 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.389
 all the positivity necessary for its harmonious transformation 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.280
 this point of understanding it is vital 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.440
 people imagine how often very often by their attitude 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.290
 sometimes negative 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
 they are constantly learning this energy in everything around them 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.990
 the result is tension 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.990
 a quirk that serve them 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.680
 make the choice of the heart and blessings a little cool move away 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.009
 in that case 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:18.719
 we all have in us 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.189
 the remarkable power of transforming any form of damage that hiv tea 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.219
 in positive explains 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.819
 god is involved 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.919
 all you need is an approach that is strong enough to change everything 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:32.909
 for example 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.569
 a person can say 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.709
 I do not have this or that 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.269
 on the contrary 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.269
 I already have one now everything I want to take 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.830
 this law of life 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 it's extremely simple and everyone can put it into practice every moment 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.199
 the decision to return to the seams 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.840
 understand that the life energy that drives us but not in the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.789
 unscrupulous 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.299
 if we wish the opulence of all things in our existence 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.049
 and although richie hall the incident 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:12.459
 so simple to implement simply just keep control of our 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.259
 emotions at every moment 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.259
 of cards and harmony in a feeling 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.489
 if we become discordant 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.489
 we immediately encounter the influx of positive energy 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.680
 for all that, all the good that life is temporary 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:33.569
 absolute understanding of these points of resistance and the open door to 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.569
 inner and outer happiness 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.139
 it's for example Thursday 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.009
 I am sick or worse 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.009
 as well as this situation 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.419
 I deprive myself of all the benefits of the energy of the city that flows in 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.079
 less 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.139
 remember that I was able to accelerate healing 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.979
 or improve the situation 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.279
 it would be better to say 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.040
 I am my perfect health now and forever 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.519
 or 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.789
 I am the presence of god in action who is j and who sums up this situation 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.349
 never believe 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.999
 like anything negative and power over this 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:18.010
 god is more powerful than any form of discordant energy and 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.289
 as vivien is in each of us what I imagined the energy that is to 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.439
 our arrangement 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.309
 the more we will manifest harmony in our life without 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.529
 interruption 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.389
 the more we will not accumulate the positive energy needed 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.930
 the transformation of our inner sound 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.930
 and our living conditions beautifully 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.749
 do you see everyone can prove himself to himself at every moment 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.029
 that he looks very long in his life 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.249
 there is only j will always follow his creator in both directions 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 so let us prefer the one who brings us joy and happiness 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.199
 christian klar 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.869
 for living words to do it
