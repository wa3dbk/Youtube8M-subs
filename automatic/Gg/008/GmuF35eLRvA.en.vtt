Smashbox photo-finish color correcting

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.960 
Smashbox photo-finish color correcting
and<00:00:12.929> I'll<00:00:13.019> click<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:15.350> this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.830> base<00:00:17.430> that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and I'll click this this is a base that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.900 
and I'll click this this is a base that
you<00:00:18.090> put<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.590> underneath<00:00:19.590> your<00:00:19.740> foundations<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you put on underneath your foundations a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310 
you put on underneath your foundations a
primer<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.539> put<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.779> underneath<00:00:22.109> your

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
primer that you put on underneath your

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.519 
primer that you put on underneath your
foundation<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.990> usually<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> wouldn't<00:00:25.260> buy

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
foundation so usually I wouldn't buy

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.320 
foundation so usually I wouldn't buy
something<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.119> actually

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
something like this and I was actually

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.929 
something like this and I was actually
really<00:00:27.630> surprised<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.439> bought<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.250> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
really surprised that I bought it it's I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.110 
really surprised that I bought it it's I
got<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.660> from<00:00:30.779> shoppers<00:00:31.289> um<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.090> was

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
got it from shoppers um I think it was

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
got it from shoppers um I think it was
$30<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:35.450> still<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.620> really

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
$30 and it's still like really really

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
$30 and it's still like really really
full<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> product<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
full so I think this is a product that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
full so I think this is a product that
would<00:00:40.050> last<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> year<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.520> it's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
would last you like a year or so it's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
would last you like a year or so it's
one<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.120> products<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.440> use

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
one of those products that you don't use

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.160 
one of those products that you don't use
very<00:00:43.829> much<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.719> reason<00:00:46.050> why<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
very much of it all but the reason why I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
very much of it all but the reason why I
got<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.190> also<00:00:47.370> something<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
got it and this is also something that I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
got it and this is also something that I
usually<00:00:48.300> don't<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> chick

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
usually don't do is that like the chick

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.319 
usually don't do is that like the chick
came<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> helped<00:00:50.789> me<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.180> like

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
came and kind of helped me and was like

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
came and kind of helped me and was like
oh<00:00:51.449> try<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.899> try<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.910> but

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
oh try this try that and I was like but

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
oh try this try that and I was like but
I<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.590> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I really really like this and I'm so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.380 
I really really like this and I'm so
super<00:00:56.219> bad<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
super bad that I got it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.529 
super bad that I got it
so<00:00:57.719> basically<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> way<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.010> works<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
so basically the way that it works is

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.660 
so basically the way that it works is
I'm<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.750> gonna<00:01:00.840> apply<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.190> I'll

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I'm just gonna apply it and then I'll

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.170 
I'm just gonna apply it and then I'll
show<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.350> once<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> primer<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.129> applied<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
show you once a primer is applied to it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.899 
show you once a primer is applied to it
so<00:01:06.540> I'll<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.229> apply<00:01:07.619> half<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.700> face

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
so I'll just apply half of it on my face

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.460 
so I'll just apply half of it on my face
with<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> primer<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.689> half<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> without

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
with the primer and half of it without

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.250 
with the primer and half of it without
and<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> difference<00:01:13.140> at

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and see if you can see the difference at

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.190 
and see if you can see the difference at
all<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.150> open<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.750> said<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
half and a half once I apply a powder

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.880 

so<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> side<00:03:06.209> with<00:03:06.420> no<00:03:06.629> primer<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.560> I

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
so this is a side with no primer so I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.660 
so this is a side with no primer so I
don't<00:03:08.099> know<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.519> tell<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
don't know if you can tell the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.640 
don't know if you can tell the
difference<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.450> can<00:03:09.690> definitely<00:03:09.780> feel<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
difference but I can definitely feel the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.630 
difference but I can definitely feel the
difference<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.340> feels<00:03:11.640> way<00:03:12.090> different<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:13.110> um

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
difference it feels way different so um

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.190 
difference it feels way different so um
I<00:03:14.640> don't<00:03:14.940> necessarily<00:03:15.330> put<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.989> primer

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
