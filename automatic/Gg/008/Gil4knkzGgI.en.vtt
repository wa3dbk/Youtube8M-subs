sides<00:02:59.830> why<00:03:00.519> might<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.790> use<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.180> site<00:03:01.620> may<00:03:02.620> be

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
sides why might we use this site may be

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.780 
sides why might we use this site may be
to<00:03:02.890> place<00:03:03.129> it<00:03:03.310> when<00:03:03.700> will<00:03:03.879> we<00:03:04.000> place<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:05.790> maybe

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
to place it when will we place it maybe

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.210 
to place it when will we place it maybe
if<00:03:06.970> we're<00:03:07.180> really<00:03:07.360> close

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
if we're really close

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.210 
if we're really close
possibly<00:03:09.220> penalty<00:03:09.700> yeah<00:03:10.860> possibly<00:03:11.860> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
possibly penalty yeah possibly a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.759

free-kick yeah

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.440 
free-kick yeah
when<00:03:14.769> we've<00:03:14.920> got<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> good<00:03:15.250> runner<00:03:15.459> when<00:03:16.269> it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
when we've got a good runner when it's

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.360 
when we've got a good runner when it's
one-on-one<00:03:16.629> definitely<00:03:17.349> so<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.099> bigger

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
one-on-one definitely so is it a bigger

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.330 
one-on-one definitely so is it a bigger
part<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.910> use<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.500> yeah<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.769> it's<00:03:20.920> we<00:03:21.099> can<00:03:21.129> be

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
part to use it yeah so it's we can be

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.009 
part to use it yeah so it's we can be
quite<00:03:21.549> accurate<00:03:21.730> with<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.330> what<00:03:22.870> other

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019

outside you foot yeah it for they work

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.449 
outside you foot yeah it for they work
so<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:42.790> can<00:03:42.970> try<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.870> outside<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.410> our<00:03:44.530> foot<00:03:44.739> so

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
so we can try the outside of our foot so

so we can try the outside of our foot so
sometimes<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.030> might<00:03:46.239> curl<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.810> ball<00:03:46.959> a

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
sometimes that might curl the ball a

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.509 
sometimes that might curl the ball a
little<00:03:47.170> bit<00:03:47.410> what<00:03:48.190> other<00:03:48.370> parts<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.879> we<00:03:48.970> use

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
little bit what other parts can we use

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.069 
little bit what other parts can we use
laces<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:52.030> is<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.360> laces<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.780> good<00:03:52.930> what

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
laces what is the laces of good what

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.930 
laces what is the laces of good what
part<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.440> use<00:03:53.620> white<00:03:54.519> why<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.910> good<00:03:55.269> power

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
part to use white why is that good power

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.750 
part to use white why is that good power
you<00:03:57.940> can<00:03:58.120> either<00:03:58.269> go<00:03:58.540> down<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.170> side<00:03:59.670> or<00:04:00.670> you

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
you can either go down one side or you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.720 
you can either go down one side or you
can<00:04:00.940> go<00:04:01.120> down<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.569> other<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:03.250> when<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.549> go

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
can go down the other but when you go

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.770 
can go down the other but when you go
down<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.180> side<00:04:04.510> what<00:04:05.019> I'd<00:04:05.139> like<00:04:05.319> you<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.769> is

down the side what I'd like you to do is

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.160 
down the side what I'd like you to do is
then<00:04:07.780> try<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.200> shoot<00:04:09.180> from<00:04:10.180> one<00:04:10.450> side<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
then try and shoot from one side of the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.160 
then try and shoot from one side of the
channel<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:12.849> what<00:04:13.030> part<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.630> goal<00:04:13.810> might<00:04:14.019> I

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
channel so what part of the goal might I

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.129 
channel so what part of the goal might I
aim<00:04:14.410> for<00:04:14.440> from<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:15.010> side<00:04:15.810> right

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
aim for from this side right

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.560 
aim for from this side right
