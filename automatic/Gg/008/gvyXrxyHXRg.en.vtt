I want to show you the velbon ultra

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.990 
I want to show you the velbon ultra
stack<00:00:07.830> L<00:00:08.099> 50<00:00:08.610> which<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.240> my<00:00:09.900> choice<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.530> monopod

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
stack L 50 which is my choice of monopod

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.270 
stack L 50 which is my choice of monopod
and<00:00:12.000> there's<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> few<00:00:12.719> reasons<00:00:12.780> why<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.650> sort<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and there's a few reasons why I sort of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.760 
and there's a few reasons why I sort of
to<00:00:14.490> me<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> best<00:00:15.389> from<00:00:16.109> my<00:00:16.260> use<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
to me this is the best from my use and

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.150 
to me this is the best from my use and
it<00:00:17.460> only<00:00:17.550> has<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> few<00:00:18.180> downsides<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.920> I'll<00:00:20.010> go

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
it only has a few downsides so I'll go

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.570 
it only has a few downsides so I'll go
over<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> plus<00:00:22.380> points<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
over that the plus points are it's the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.620 
over that the plus points are it's the
most<00:00:23.789> compact<00:00:24.330> monopod<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.439> I've<00:00:25.529> found

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
most compact monopod that I've found

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.700 
most compact monopod that I've found
that<00:00:27.630> goes<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> full<00:00:28.109> height<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.590> one

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that goes to full height so that's one

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.609 
that goes to full height so that's one
hundred<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.099> fifty<00:00:29.939> five<00:00:30.060> centimeters<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
hundred and fifty five centimeters and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.030 
hundred and fifty five centimeters and
then<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.219> minimum<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.880> 14<00:00:33.719> inches<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.290> 37

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
then the minimum is 14 inches like 37

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340 
then the minimum is 14 inches like 37
centimeters<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.880> that's<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.780> compact<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
centimeters and that's really compact I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.569 
centimeters and that's really compact I
mean<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.559> literally<00:00:37.770> put<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> back<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.520> my

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
mean it literally put it the back of my

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.340 
mean it literally put it the back of my
bag<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.510> lightweight<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bag that's really lightweight as well so

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
bag that's really lightweight as well so
really<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.790> carry<00:00:42.030> around

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
really really good to carry around

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
really really good to carry around
because<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.230> monopods<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.920> much

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
because I don't use monopods that much

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.290 
because I don't use monopods that much
I'm<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.399> shooting<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> monopod<00:00:45.090> all

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I'm not shooting with the monopod all

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
I'm not shooting with the monopod all
day<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> might<00:00:46.500> need<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.890> maybe

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
day it's like I might need one maybe

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.229 
day it's like I might need one maybe
here<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.250> just<00:00:50.250> went<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
here in that so I just went for this I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
here in that so I just went for this I
can<00:00:51.570> still<00:00:51.750> connect<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.110> head<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> top<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
can still connect a head to the top of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.170 
can still connect a head to the top of
this<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.670> tried<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.879> with<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> couple

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this I tried this with the with a couple

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.830 
this I tried this with the with a couple
of<00:00:57.239> different<00:00:57.480> heads<00:00:57.629> worked<00:00:58.199> fine<00:00:58.760> but<00:00:59.840> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
of different heads worked fine but the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
of different heads worked fine but the
other<00:01:00.870> thing<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:02.039> really

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
other thing is that it's really really

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.710 
other thing is that it's really really
quick<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> open<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.619> twist<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.720> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
quick to open so you twist like that and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.100 
quick to open so you twist like that and
then<00:01:06.869> pull<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.869> then<00:01:09.869> lock<00:01:10.080> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
then pull it's actually and then lock it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.080 
then pull it's actually and then lock it
back<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.680> twist<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.159> back<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.000> way

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
back so you twist it back the other way

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.899 
back so you twist it back the other way
and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.729> monopod

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and then that's your monopod

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
and then that's your monopod
ready<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.600> go<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> only<00:01:16.710> thing<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ready to go now the only thing is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.190 
ready to go now the only thing is
sometimes<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.360> leg<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> sections<00:01:19.049> don't

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sometimes the leg the sections don't

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
sometimes the leg the sections don't
actually<00:01:19.439> hold<00:01:19.970> fully<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> don't

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
actually hold fully like if you don't

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
actually hold fully like if you don't
twist<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> hard<00:01:22.049> enough<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.939> press<00:01:23.939> down

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
twist it hard enough and you press down

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.380 
twist it hard enough and you press down
then<00:01:24.570> sometimes<00:01:24.930> it'll<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.170> let<00:01:25.890> go<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> bit

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
then sometimes it'll just let go a bit

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.649 
then sometimes it'll just let go a bit
like<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
like that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
like that
now<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> lot<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:29.130> than<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> weight

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
now that was a lot more than the weight

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.789 
now that was a lot more than the weight
of<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> camera<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.869> won't<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.409> happen<00:01:31.560> with

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
of a camera so won't really happen with

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.690 
of a camera so won't really happen with
the<00:01:31.860> camera<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> make<00:01:32.640> sure

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the camera but you do have to make sure

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.819 
the camera but you do have to make sure
that<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.030> sort<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:34.229> lock<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> bit

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that you sort of really lock it a bit

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.450 
that you sort of really lock it a bit
other<00:01:35.820> than<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:37.140> pretty<00:01:37.350> good<00:01:37.650> um<00:01:37.920> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
other than that it's pretty good um so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.060 
other than that it's pretty good um so
the<00:01:38.549> only<00:01:38.700> issue<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> weight

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the only issue here is just the weight

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
the only issue here is just the weight
like<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> wanted<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.970> hold<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.299> big<00:01:42.540> camera

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
like if you wanted to hold a big camera

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.039 
like if you wanted to hold a big camera
let's<00:01:43.229> say<00:01:43.409> overhead<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.270> sometimes

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
let's say overhead I know like sometimes

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
let's say overhead I know like sometimes
you<00:01:46.140> want<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.890> weird<00:01:47.759> shot

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.569 
then this is a bit it works I mean I put
a<00:01:53.579> put<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> DSLR<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.399> medium<00:01:56.399> sized

a put a DSLR here with a medium sized
lens<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.930> fine<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.710> kind<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
lens and it was fine but it was kind of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.139 
lens and it was fine but it was kind of
bending<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.610> bit<00:01:59.820> here

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
bending a little bit here

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.319 
bending a little bit here
this<00:02:00.630> isn't<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.579> this<00:02:02.579> isn't<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this isn't like this isn't really like a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.990 
this isn't like this isn't really like a
really<00:02:03.829> strong<00:02:04.829> monopod<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.700> really

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
really strong monopod it's a really

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
really strong monopod it's a really
lightweight<00:02:06.409> monopod<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
lightweight monopod and that's what I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.699 
lightweight monopod and that's what I
wanted<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> actually<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.679> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
wanted this is actually you can have a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.110 
wanted this is actually you can have a
look<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.860> my<00:02:10.920> other<00:02:11.039> video<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.670> where<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
look at my other video which is where I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940 
look at my other video which is where I
sort<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.959> used<00:02:13.260> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
sort of used this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.260 
sort of used this
I<00:02:13.980> connected<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> bottom<00:02:15.180> my

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I connected this to the bottom my

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.990 
I connected this to the bottom my
glidecam<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.320> video<00:02:16.500> shooting<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
glidecam for video shooting so have a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.340 
glidecam for video shooting so have a
look<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.390> if<00:02:18.570> you're<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> video<00:02:18.870> shooter

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
look at that if you're a video shooter

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.570 
look at that if you're a video shooter
but<00:02:20.690> overall<00:02:21.690> I'm<00:02:21.960> really<00:02:22.020> happy<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.620> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
but overall I'm really happy with it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.310 
but overall I'm really happy with it
folding<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.330> back<00:02:24.360> nice<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.470> easy<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:27.290> yeah<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
folding it back nice and easy and yeah I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
folding it back nice and easy and yeah I
mean<00:02:29.510> overall<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.810> good<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.620> foam<00:02:32.100> stuff

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
mean overall very good this foam stuff

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.180 
mean overall very good this foam stuff
here<00:02:32.640> pretty<00:02:33.510> Goods<00:02:33.750> pretty<00:02:34.050> standard<00:02:34.560> now

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
here pretty Goods pretty standard now

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.100 
here pretty Goods pretty standard now
another<00:02:36.060> thing<00:02:36.300> about<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> price

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
another thing about this is the price

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.770 
another thing about this is the price
it's<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:38.160> cheap<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.970> got

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's really really cheap it's like I got

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.970 
it's really really cheap it's like I got
this<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.200> 20<00:02:40.500> pounds

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this for like 20 pounds

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.080 
this for like 20 pounds
I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.700> 25<00:02:42.450> new<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.470> Amazon

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
I think it's 25 new on Amazon

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.900 
I think it's 25 new on Amazon
so<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:46.380> probably<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> cheapest<00:02:47.520> monopod

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
so it's probably the cheapest monopod

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.050 
so it's probably the cheapest monopod
you'll<00:02:48.060> get<00:02:48.650> other<00:02:49.650> than<00:02:50.010> cheap<00:02:50.400> eBay<00:02:50.670> stuff

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you'll get other than cheap eBay stuff

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.860 
you'll get other than cheap eBay stuff
which<00:02:51.450> probably<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.500> junk<00:02:53.510> well<00:02:54.510> sometimes

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
which probably just junk well sometimes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.650 
which probably just junk well sometimes
it<00:02:54.990> as<00:02:55.080> soon<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.470> isn't<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
it as soon as it isn't but I think the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270 
it as soon as it isn't but I think the
cheapest<00:02:58.110> you'll<00:02:58.200> find<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:58.440> eBay<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.740> about<00:02:58.920> 15

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
cheapest you'll find on eBay is about 15

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.460 
cheapest you'll find on eBay is about 15
pounds<00:02:59.430> spend<00:03:00.270> an<00:03:00.360> extra<00:03:00.600> 10<00:03:00.870> pounds<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.350> you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
pounds spend an extra 10 pounds and you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890 
pounds spend an extra 10 pounds and you
actually<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:02.000> one<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.300> get<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.450> brand<00:03:03.690> name

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
actually get one you get a brand name

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.470 
actually get one you get a brand name
and<00:03:04.080> two<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.380> get<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.590> which<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:05.270> much<00:03:06.270> more

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and two you get one which is much more

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.090 
and two you get one which is much more
compact<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.170> only<00:03:07.500> ones<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.770> have<00:03:07.890> found<00:03:08.040> in

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
compact the only ones I have found in

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.030 
compact the only ones I have found in
eBay<00:03:08.390> were<00:03:09.390> much<00:03:09.630> bigger<00:03:09.840> than<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.380> some

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
eBay were much bigger than this and some

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.250 
eBay were much bigger than this and some
of<00:03:11.130> them<00:03:11.220> didn't<00:03:11.430> even<00:03:11.490> go<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.850> high<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.870> mean

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
of them didn't even go as high so I mean

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.530 
of them didn't even go as high so I mean
much<00:03:13.440> bigger<00:03:13.680> folded<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.880> didn't<00:03:15.120> go<00:03:15.210> as<00:03:15.330> high

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
much bigger folded but didn't go as high
