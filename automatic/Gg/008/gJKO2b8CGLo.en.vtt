00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 It sounded like a dream to him. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.080
 while he was able to perform 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.030
 That incredible feat and then we 'll go 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.090
 for two more lagoon overtaking 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.280
 back I do not remember exactly sixth 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.510
 So I dropped in there and fell to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.640
 fifth fell to fifth 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 he did all the overtaking in one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 only comes back and has a characteristic of this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.439
 that at any given moment in the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 Trade accounts were to find out why 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.110
 the club itself three times more than 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.829
 I would stop the rain was there and a 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 certain moment he entered the box 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 from donington park is windy enough 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.550
 he came in through donington's barrel 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.129
 park and did not stop and at that time there 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.610
 had pit lane speed limit 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.559
 he went there for 200 mess and he did not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 had warned and warned not to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.090
 had nothing and I kept saying regional 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.039
 from what happened i do not already know 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.210
 mclaren was wrong that the radio that did not 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.150
 it worked and it lasted the whole race 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.790
 we must explain that the entry of the two 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.240
 she does one 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.090
 curve that returns before the curve that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.670
 bring it straight and look what happened in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 head of genius 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 after the race he said to us in the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.869
 training he had to try is me 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.970
 I went there to see the time of the return 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.070
 going inside the box 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 because if I had to spend another 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 once the project had spent about 45 in 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 Race may be wondering 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.310
 story passed at 45 he said 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.009
 so I wanted to see just ask in the hype 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.259
 who then tired time gave the time 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 He said it's good if he had to. 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.020
 entering and passing the project post is 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.299
 result is the only race in history 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.040
 of the world motorsport that comes back 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.189
 the fastest race was given by 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.740
 inside the box officially back 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.460
 the image shows him passes in front box 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.259
 of mclaren does all this with me 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.869
 that's when he got back 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.849
 and had your patrick head it you look and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.000
 It would be a nightmare I would like to 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.160
 forget about mine 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.170
 who is he told and he said the following 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.860
 without him it was absolutely necessary to say 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.870
 yea 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.120
 without taking one by another means to 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.390
 the network of the opposing team and still want 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.680
 the next in line exactly then he 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.410
 He spoke as soon as he took a 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.140
 mil of eta feat that day 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 that day we did everything we could 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.190
 to do anything we did is good to tell you 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.860
 that while he said that those 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.510
 all project words were because it 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.670
 I was thinking that the tire problem 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.740
 in fact the car was very low 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 more capital creeping on the floor 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.670
 The microphone with the car was very 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 down and around and he could not stand 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.750
 on the runway, nor the river at all, nor 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.420
 process then when he discovered this 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.190
 her in the seventh and eighth stop them 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.900
 they did but it was not only that it is a 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.620
 nightmare that I do not even like to remember 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.750
 And it's good that Donington came into the life of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.820
 ayrton senna long before that is in the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.300
 Truth long before he entered Little 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.500
 before it enters formula 1 and this 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.600
 It's one of the things I like best 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 remember this report that I did what 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.850
 I wanted to ask you did you do great 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.970
 reports on the latter will tell 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.440
 do not have 40 years so even I find it 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.510
 One reason for pride is that I started 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:31.930
 with 15 suitcase and this is so sometimes strip 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.030
 his condition was that he would ask if 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.420
 this is one of the people that is is not a 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.610
 something that brings you a memory 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.670
 extremely affectionate because you saw the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.739
 birth of an idol you saw the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.220
 birth for formula 1 first 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.320
 moment in formula 1 of that of my 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.970
 modest opinion is the greatest pilot of 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.860
 all the times you 're saying how 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.120
 professional I say even more 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.700
 I saw the feeling minute by 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.230
 pilot who was about to perform 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.500
 Big dream of his life. 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.090
 We left London a day before 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.489
 people Stayed in hotel 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.360
 there inside donington park with sÃ©rgio 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.360
 I was together
