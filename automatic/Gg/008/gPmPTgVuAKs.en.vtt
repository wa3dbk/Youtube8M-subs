 barely five years ago they quietly began to see each other 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.280
 warm summer night of the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.930
 helped by powerful focus and sometimes by the moon 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.840
 you can see the trellis of interpretation of montilla cÃ³rdoba 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.420
 specialized in a small room of variety as cabernet sauvignon if carlos 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 merlo 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.590
 the nocturnal vintage mechanization contributes to slow down the process of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.720
 natural oxidation of the uba 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.900
 a fermentation below 25 degrees allows you to take advantage of the fragrance 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 of the uba among others 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.290
 in terms of temperature what is fundamentally pursued is that the eu 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.520
 get as cold as possible to lengthen because in the cpsc fermentation it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 try to always get below 25 degrees of temperature 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 so that the properties of the wine are the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.330
 the aromatic environment and in archery use is the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.390
 suitable and if in the rest of the world they produce cheaper wines 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.189
 able 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.240
 produce a kilo of grape photo cheaper than us are badly located 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.799
 then it is logically get with this type of holdings 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.020
 because first you have to have a stable vineyard as in the case 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.380
 and then adapt the percent using the best possible means 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.080
 mechanical to the object of postÃ­n and sameep a lolo what the production costs 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.930
 At dawn, the ambient temperature does not exceed 18 degrees 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.130
 and this fact supposes an important improvement in the quality of the grape 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.730
 there is also a chaotic energy efficiency at the time of 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.730
 cool the fermentation tanks in the long 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.509
 not to a harvester allows to harvest around 100 thousand kilos per hour 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.669
 throughout the night they have been harvested from the port blond farm around the 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.669
 50 thousand kilos of red grapes 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.559
 with the vintage concludes with the first lights of the morning 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.489
 the controlled fermentation 72 dollars of the union cooperative 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.059
 It really is not enough
