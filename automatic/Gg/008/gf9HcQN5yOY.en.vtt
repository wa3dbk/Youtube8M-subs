00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
debate once more as a sign I suppose

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.050 
debate once more as a sign I suppose
that<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> information<00:01:20.520> war<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that the information war is going to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.640 
that the information war is going to
carry<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.509> long<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.810> they're<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> ground

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
carry on as long as they're the ground

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
carry on as long as they're the ground
war<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.310> interesting<00:01:23.729> stuff<00:01:23.850> isn't

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
war well it is interesting stuff isn't

war well it is interesting stuff isn't
it<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> mean<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.320> theories<00:01:25.619> about

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it I mean what are the theories about

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.710 
it I mean what are the theories about
where<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> rebels<00:01:26.909> could<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.360> acquired

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
these these chemical weapons if indeed

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.760 
these these chemical weapons if indeed
this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.780> correct<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> turns

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
this is this is correct well if it turns

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.990 
this is this is correct well if it turns
out<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.100> true<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
out to be true and that the the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.340 
out to be true and that the the

who gets what and where is it makes it

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.790 
who gets what and where is it makes it
much<00:03:16.600> more<00:03:16.810> problematic<00:03:17.080> for<00:03:17.680> this

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
much more problematic for this

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.729 
much more problematic for this
administration<00:03:18.930> okay<00:03:19.930> what<00:03:20.110> he's<00:03:20.230> had<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.440> say

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
administration okay what he's had to say

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.990 
administration okay what he's had to say
about<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:21.100> emits<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.489> potentially

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
about that emits a potentially

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.780 
about that emits a potentially
game-changing<00:03:23.160> situation<00:03:24.160> quite<00:03:24.370> dramatic

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
game-changing situation quite dramatic

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.220 
game-changing situation quite dramatic
stuff<00:03:25.000> isn't<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.360> yeah<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.690> course<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.110> mean

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
stuff isn't it yeah of course I mean

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.930 
stuff isn't it yeah of course I mean
we've<00:03:26.680> seen<00:03:26.709> over<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.250> last<00:03:27.280> few<00:03:27.610> weeks<00:03:27.640> that
