00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
methods of recording the sound the first

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.770 
methods of recording the sound the first
video<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.190> naive<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.730> first<00:00:39.540> video

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

I<00:00:39.840> ever<00:00:40.050> posted<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.590> YouTube<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.030> hear

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I ever posted on YouTube you can hear

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
I ever posted on YouTube you can hear
this<00:00:42.480> internal<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.379> hard<00:00:43.649> drive<00:00:43.920> clicking

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this internal like hard drive clicking

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
this internal like hard drive clicking
all<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.090> through<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.510> could<00:00:45.719> lick<00:00:45.870> lick

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
all the way through is I could lick lick

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.920 
all the way through is I could lick lick
lick<00:00:46.559> lick<00:00:46.800> lick<00:00:46.920> lick<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.629> obviously

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
lick lick lick lick and so obviously

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.299 
lick lick lick lick and so obviously
that<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.730> doable<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that was just not doable and then I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.639 
that was just not doable and then I
tried<00:00:53.699> recording<00:00:53.969> some<00:00:54.390> videos<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
tried recording some videos with a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.299 
tried recording some videos with a
digital<00:00:55.920> camera<00:00:56.239> for<00:00:57.239> example<00:00:58.039> love<00:00:59.039> not

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
digital camera for example love not

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.930 
digital camera for example love not
money<00:00:59.750> which<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.870> an<00:01:00.989> original<00:01:01.379> song<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
money which is an original song and

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.230 
money which is an original song and
maybe<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> could<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:04.140> cover<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:05.000> our<00:01:06.000> lady

maybe you could see my cover of our lady
peace<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:07.080> am<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.590> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
peace for am so you get all this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.700 
peace for am so you get all this
external<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:12.110> sound<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> really

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
external like sound which you really

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
external like sound which you really
really<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.130> want<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.000> great

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
really don't want so that's not great

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
really don't want so that's not great
but<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.689> condenser<00:01:16.409> mic<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.830> really

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
but with a condenser mic it's really

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
but with a condenser mic it's really
sensitive<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.330> picks<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.049> it's

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sensitive but it just picks up what it's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
sensitive but it just picks up what it's
supposed<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> pick<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.979> basically<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
supposed to pick up basically is the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
supposed to pick up basically is the
idea<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.729> any<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
idea and you don't get any of that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
idea and you don't get any of that
hissing<00:01:24.659> or<00:01:24.990> fuzzy<00:01:25.350> sound<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.430> with

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hissing or fuzzy sound that you get with

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.020 
hissing or fuzzy sound that you get with
other<00:01:26.700> mics<00:01:27.380> which<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.770> great<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.790> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
other mics which is really great so it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
other mics which is really great so it's
really<00:01:30.390> ideal<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.259> youtube<00:01:31.829> videos<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.250> find

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
really ideal for youtube videos I find

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
really ideal for youtube videos I find
and<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:33.210> quite<00:01:33.360> surprised<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.960> hear<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and I was quite surprised to hear the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.010 
and I was quite surprised to hear the
price<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.479> 69

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
price because it's actually just 69

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.700 
price because it's actually just 69
pound<00:01:37.320> 99<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.110> compared<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> other

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pound 99 which I think compared to other

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
pound 99 which I think compared to other
mics<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> market<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> mean<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.030> haven't<00:01:42.270> done

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
mics on the market I mean I haven't done

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
mics on the market I mean I haven't done
a<00:01:42.450> whole<00:01:42.509> lot<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.020> research<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.280> got

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
a whole lot of research but you know got

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
a whole lot of research but you know got
the<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.970> snowball<00:01:45.450> microphone<00:01:45.840> thing<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the the snowball microphone thing and I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
the the snowball microphone thing and I
recorded<00:01:47.189> fast<00:01:47.460> car<00:01:47.700> video<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.450> me<00:01:49.079> know

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
recorded fast car video with the me know

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.649 
recorded fast car video with the me know
ultra<00:01:49.860> flip<00:01:50.189> thingamajiggy<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.149> did<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> wasn't

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
ultra flip thingamajiggy I did I wasn't

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
ultra flip thingamajiggy I did I wasn't
too<00:01:51.750> impressed<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> sound<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> think

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
too impressed by the sound so I think

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.410 
too impressed by the sound so I think
for<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.119> condenser<00:01:54.659> mic<00:01:54.979> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.420> really

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
for a condenser mic this is a really

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.530 
for a condenser mic this is a really
good<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:58.020> deal<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.710> decent<00:01:58.950> sound

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
good good deal on a really decent sound
