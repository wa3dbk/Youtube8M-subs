gonna be measuring a few things and then

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.580 
gonna be measuring a few things and then
I'm<00:00:21.029> doing<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.539> cutting<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.050> grinding<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
I'm doing some cutting and grinding and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460 
I'm doing some cutting and grinding and
welding<00:00:22.849> here<00:00:23.849> we<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.449> pipe<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.349> I've

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
welding here we have some pipe that I've

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
welding here we have some pipe that I've
taken<00:00:25.769> from<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> handlebars<00:00:26.900> first<00:00:27.900> thing

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
taken from the handlebars first thing

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.029 
taken from the handlebars first thing
we're<00:00:28.109> gonna<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.289> doing<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.560> cutting<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
we're gonna be doing is cutting this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.100 
we're gonna be doing is cutting this
into<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.429> smaller<00:00:29.820> 45<00:00:30.480> degree<00:00:30.869> section<00:00:36.110> okay

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
into a smaller 45 degree section okay

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
into a smaller 45 degree section okay
cut<00:00:37.560> off<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:38.070> piece<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.370> we've<00:00:38.700> done<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
cut off the first piece and we've done a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.820 
cut off the first piece and we've done a
little<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.330> grinding<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> inside<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
little bit of grinding on the inside of

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.130 
little bit of grinding on the inside of
this<00:00:40.920> flange<00:00:41.310> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> pipe<00:00:42.060> end<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:42.960> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this flange and the pipe end and now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
this flange and the pipe end and now
we're<00:00:43.290> gonna<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> together<00:00:44.520> using<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
we're gonna make it together using this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we're gonna make it together using this
rather<00:00:46.110> precarious<00:00:46.470> looking<00:00:47.160> jig

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.570 

okay<00:00:57.200> after<00:00:57.440> a<00:00:57.620> little<00:00:57.890> bit<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.100> welding<00:00:58.550> you

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
okay after a little bit of welding you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.229 
okay after a little bit of welding you
see<00:00:58.880> I<00:00:58.910> welded<00:00:59.240> the<00:01:00.080> inside

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
see I welded the inside

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.420 
see I welded the inside
and<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:02.960> been<00:01:03.140> finished<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.890> air<00:01:04.159> tool

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
and it's been finished with the air tool

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.240 
and it's been finished with the air tool
I<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:04.850> sort<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.830> sort<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.920> milling

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
I have this sort of a sort of a milling

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.270 
I have this sort of a sort of a milling
tool<00:01:07.490> that's<00:01:07.790> helped<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.150> smooth<00:01:08.840> out<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
tool that's helped to smooth out the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.310 
tool that's helped to smooth out the
welds<00:01:10.640> on<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.820> inside<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.900> sort<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.140> give

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
welds on the inside and to sort of give

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.890 
welds on the inside and to sort of give
it<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.430> know<00:01:13.550> sort<00:01:13.760> of<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.970> rounded<00:01:14.450> profile

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
it a you know sort of a rounded profile

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.170 
it a you know sort of a rounded profile
here<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.860> then<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.250> added<00:01:16.430> some<00:01:16.580> weld<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
here and then I added some weld on the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.670 
here and then I added some weld on the
outside<00:01:17.540> but<00:01:17.750> because<00:01:18.049> of<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.290> distance

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
outside but because of the distance

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.080 
outside but because of the distance
between<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.070> two<00:01:19.250> mounting<00:01:19.670> bolts<00:01:20.000> you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
between the two mounting bolts you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.690 
between the two mounting bolts you
really<00:01:20.360> have<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.690> you<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.409> see<00:01:21.619> that<00:01:21.830> round<00:01:22.520> it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
really have to you can see that round it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.030 
really have to you can see that round it
off<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:24.530> weld<00:01:24.850> all<00:01:25.850> around<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> edge<00:01:26.450> and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
off the weld all around the edge and

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.740 
off the weld all around the edge and
that<00:01:28.040> will<00:01:28.340> allow<00:01:28.580> me<00:01:28.759> some<00:01:28.970> space<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.570> be<00:01:29.690> able

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
that will allow me some space to be able

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.990 
that will allow me some space to be able
to<00:01:29.960> put<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.380> m6<00:01:30.830> so<00:01:31.040> there's<00:01:31.250> m6<00:01:31.610> mounting

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
to put the m6 so there's m6 mounting

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.580 
to put the m6 so there's m6 mounting
bolts<00:01:32.240> through<00:01:32.390> here<00:01:32.690> without<00:01:32.810> any<00:01:33.050> real

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
bolts through here without any real

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.910 
bolts through here without any real
problem<00:01:34.690> so<00:01:35.690> far<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.110> most<00:01:36.229> difficult<00:01:36.410> part

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
problem so far the most difficult part

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.499 
problem so far the most difficult part
of<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.070> whole<00:01:37.130> process<00:01:37.880> will<00:01:38.149> be<00:01:38.179> getting

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
of this whole process will be getting

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.440 
of this whole process will be getting
this<00:01:38.750> round<00:01:39.440> washer<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:41.030> using<00:01:41.210> as<00:01:41.420> a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
this round washer that I'm using as a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.410 
this round washer that I'm using as a
flange<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:42.110> fit<00:01:42.350> into<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.710> space<00:01:42.860> here<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.330> to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
flange to fit into the space here and to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.450 
flange to fit into the space here and to
get<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.660> all<00:01:44.780> lined<00:01:44.960> up<00:01:45.200> properly<00:01:45.619> tight

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
get it all lined up properly tight

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.700 
get it all lined up properly tight
tolerances<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.420> that's<00:01:48.020> where<00:01:48.289> we<00:01:48.410> are<00:01:48.530> now

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
tolerances and that's where we are now

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.779 
tolerances and that's where we are now
I'm<00:01:48.920> gonna<00:01:49.039> have<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.220> do<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> little<00:01:49.490> bit<00:01:49.700> of

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
I'm gonna have to do a little bit of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.639 
I'm gonna have to do a little bit of
cutting<00:01:50.000> here<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.509> shaping<00:01:51.020> it's<00:01:51.289> gonna<00:01:51.410> take

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
cutting here and shaping it's gonna take

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.470 
cutting here and shaping it's gonna take
a<00:01:51.679> long<00:01:51.950> time

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.180 

all<00:01:57.140> right<00:01:57.260> well<00:01:57.380> I'm<00:01:57.470> pretty<00:01:57.590> much<00:01:57.800> finished

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
all right well I'm pretty much finished

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.000 
all right well I'm pretty much finished
shaping<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.730> flange<00:01:59.230> this<00:02:00.230> now<00:02:00.440> fits<00:02:00.770> in

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
shaping the flange this now fits in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.000 
shaping the flange this now fits in
quite<00:02:01.760> nicely<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.570> internal<00:02:03.410> diameter<00:02:03.560> here

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
quite nicely the internal diameter here

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.990 
quite nicely the internal diameter here
is<00:02:04.160> eighteen<00:02:04.520> point<00:02:04.850> six<00:02:05.180> millimeters<00:02:07.000> down

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
is eighteen point six millimeters down

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.520 
is eighteen point six millimeters down
to<00:02:08.150> about<00:02:08.300> eighteen<00:02:08.600> point<00:02:08.810> three<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.290> some

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
to about eighteen point three in some

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.740 
to about eighteen point three in some
places<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:10.910> nice<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.570> fits

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
places so it's it's it's nice it fits

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.200 
places so it's it's it's nice it fits
and<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:13.250> been<00:02:13.400> cleaned<00:02:13.610> up<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.850> little<00:02:13.970> bit

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
and it's been cleaned up a little bit

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.810 
and it's been cleaned up a little bit
yeah<00:02:15.110> you'll<00:02:15.680> see<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.370> second<00:02:16.700> piece

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
yeah you'll see here is the second piece

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.980 
yeah you'll see here is the second piece
I'm<00:02:16.940> gonna<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.180> joining<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> little<00:02:17.840> long

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
I'm gonna be joining it's a little long

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.240 
I'm gonna be joining it's a little long
right<00:02:18.200> now<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:18.620> gonna<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> cut<00:02:19.100> off<00:02:19.220> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
right now so I'm gonna have to cut off a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.120 
right now so I'm gonna have to cut off a
bit<00:02:19.370> later<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:19.940> for<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.240> moment<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.100> see

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
bit later but for the moment you can see

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.150 
bit later but for the moment you can see
now<00:02:22.490> I've<00:02:22.730> made<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.240> little<00:02:23.390> bit<00:02:23.570> offset

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
now I've made it a little bit offset

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.560 
now I've made it a little bit offset
it's<00:02:25.160> not<00:02:25.340> exactly<00:02:25.730> straight<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.330> flat

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
it's not exactly straight and flat

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.150 
it's not exactly straight and flat
because<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.960> wanted<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.320> make<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> radius<00:02:27.950> a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
because I wanted to make the radius a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.130 
because I wanted to make the radius a
little<00:02:28.190> tighter<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.880> radius<00:02:29.780> on<00:02:29.990> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
little tighter the radius on the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.020 
little tighter the radius on the
handlebars<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.010> was<00:02:31.160> using<00:02:31.340> for<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.790> pop

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
handlebars that I was using for this pop

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.420 
handlebars that I was using for this pop
project<00:02:32.510> are<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:33.230> big<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.160> I've<00:02:34.310> decided

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
project are a little big so I've decided

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.040 
project are a little big so I've decided
to<00:02:34.730> tighten<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.090> up<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.300> little<00:02:35.390> bit<00:02:35.630> like<00:02:35.780> that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
to tighten it up a little bit like that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:46.970 
to tighten it up a little bit like that
put<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.770> small<00:02:37.010> kink<00:02:37.820> in<00:02:37.970> there

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.130 

so<00:02:47.520> here's<00:02:47.760> my<00:02:47.940> first<00:02:48.209> attempt<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.780> building

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
so here's my first attempt at building

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.009 
so here's my first attempt at building
an<00:02:49.230> intake<00:02:49.500> manifold<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:51.120> see<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
an intake manifold you can see the

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.930 
an intake manifold you can see the
welding<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.590> not<00:02:52.769> exactly<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.310> best<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.849> I've

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
welding is not exactly the best but I've

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.030 
welding is not exactly the best but I've
only<00:02:54.030> been<00:02:54.180> welding<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:54.840> about<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> week<00:02:55.349> this

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
only been welding for about a week this

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.100 
only been welding for about a week this
flange<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.150> put<00:02:57.390> together<00:02:57.540> was<00:02:57.900> made<00:02:58.080> out

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
flange that I put together was made out

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.259 
flange that I put together was made out
of<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.440> big<00:02:58.650> washer<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.459> pretty<00:03:00.060> much

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
of that big washer and that pretty much

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.380 
of that big washer and that pretty much
took<00:03:00.450> most<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> time<00:03:02.180> building<00:03:03.180> time

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
took most of the time building time

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.970 
took most of the time building time
today<00:03:03.569> because<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.930> had<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.110> grind<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.590> go<00:03:04.739> back

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
today because I had to grind it go back

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.420 
today because I had to grind it go back
fit<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.580> grind<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.180> go<00:03:06.360> back<00:03:06.569> fit<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.080> and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
fit it and grind it go back fit it and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.490 
fit it and grind it go back fit it and
so<00:03:08.430> basically<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.880> goes<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.500> and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
so basically it goes on like that and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.690 
so basically it goes on like that and
then<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> comes<00:03:10.860> out<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.099> side<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.519> haven't

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
then it comes out of the side I haven't

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.130 
then it comes out of the side I haven't
even<00:03:11.790> measured<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.360> this<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.690> gonna<00:03:12.810> fit<00:03:12.989> on

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
even measured how this is gonna fit on

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.930 
even measured how this is gonna fit on
the<00:03:13.230> bike<00:03:13.410> yet<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.549> just<00:03:14.580> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the bike yet so this is really just a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.020 
the bike yet so this is really just a
very<00:03:14.970> rough<00:03:15.959> first<00:03:16.260> prototype<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.849> give<00:03:17.970> you

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
very rough first prototype to give you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.630 
very rough first prototype to give you
guys<00:03:18.180> an<00:03:18.330> idea<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> process<00:03:19.830> involved<00:03:20.549> in

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
guys an idea of the process involved in

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.370 
guys an idea of the process involved in
building<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:21.900> see<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.170> size

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
building these and you can see the size

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.089 
building these and you can see the size
difference<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.819> original<00:03:24.660> one<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.709> original

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
difference the original one the original

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.410 
difference the original one the original
one<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.610> for<00:03:26.790> about<00:03:26.910> fourteen

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
one here is for about fourteen

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.900 
one here is for about fourteen
millimeters<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:29.250> new<00:03:29.459> one<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.670> are

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
millimeters and this new one is are

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.160 
millimeters and this new one is are
somewhere<00:03:30.360> around<00:03:30.450> eighteen<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.049> half

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
somewhere around eighteen and a half

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.910 
somewhere around eighteen and a half
millimeters<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:33.060> quite<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.599> bit<00:03:33.810> larger<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.860> a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
millimeters so quite a bit larger it's a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.220 
millimeters so quite a bit larger it's a
bit<00:03:35.040> ugly<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.599> you<00:03:36.599> know<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.079> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
bit ugly but you know it's just a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.569 
bit ugly but you know it's just a
prototype<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:37.829> now<00:03:37.950> I'm<00:03:38.130> gonna<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.430> working

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
prototype for now I'm gonna be working

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.490 
prototype for now I'm gonna be working
on<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> bit<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.360> didn't<00:03:39.870> want<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.319> put

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
on it a bit I didn't want to have to put

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.860 
on it a bit I didn't want to have to put
this<00:03:40.680> kink<00:03:41.099> in<00:03:41.340> there<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.760> know<00:03:41.880> Lee<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.840> I

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
this kink in there you know Lee but I

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.839 
this kink in there you know Lee but I
wasn't<00:03:43.290> sure<00:03:43.440> if<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.680> would<00:03:43.769> fit<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.549> until<00:03:44.790> I

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
wasn't sure if it would fit so until I

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.509 
wasn't sure if it would fit so until I
find<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.530> pipe<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.680> has<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.860> slightly<00:03:47.250> tighter

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
find a pipe that has a slightly tighter

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.789 
find a pipe that has a slightly tighter
radius<00:03:47.880> I'm<00:03:48.299> gonna<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.290> working<00:03:49.590> out

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
radius I'm gonna be you know working out

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.770 
radius I'm gonna be you know working out
a<00:03:49.890> few<00:03:50.160> different<00:03:50.489> designs<00:03:50.790> anyway<00:03:51.450> let's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
a few different designs anyway let's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.250 
a few different designs anyway let's
take<00:03:51.959> one<00:03:52.549> stay<00:03:53.549> with<00:03:53.730> me<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.120> I'll<00:03:54.329> be<00:03:54.930> doing

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
take one stay with me and I'll be doing
