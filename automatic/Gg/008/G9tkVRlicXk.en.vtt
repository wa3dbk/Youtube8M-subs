00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.720
 first of all of the course we have 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 3d animation speech on the one hand and 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.429
 2d animation course we have 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.130
 the art for video games then everything 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.599
 that is gathered in a workshop that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 we are here where we do 2d animation 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.820
 that is to say that the first part of the year 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.410
 we draw the whole first part of the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 year would be drawing and the second part would be 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 we dedicate to the animation of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.339
 characters in first year what we do 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.159
 is to see the basics of the animation or 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.350
 there are twelve basic fundamentals that 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.000
 they learn and then they add more 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 more techniques 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 we start with very simple characters 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.900
 truth and then we go to more characters 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.900
 complexes with head arms and 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.280
 legs we take walks actions of 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.530
 run 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 actions that involve weight be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.630
 lift a weight pull a weight that at 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.400
 principle does not matter the complexity of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.580
 drawing is more what we try is to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 move volumes truth what is important is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.780
 the movement itself that they learn to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 move volumes and then if we give it 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.190
 details in detail well to the last thing what 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 main is to have a good structure 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.490
 truth and then if we are going to be 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 adding more details milestones to the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 more animation you use for animation 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.840
 where I think it's a little bit important 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.470
 the theme of the drawing is not that what the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.679
 person can handle the volume true 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.659
 the perspective the proportions this 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.240
 but good is not something exclusive, do not be 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.550
 that can be learned is the case 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.420
 of the person who won the anima videos 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.479
 last year he did not know how to touch anything 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.580
 least with very little drawing base had 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.240
 a drawing base and in the workshop and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.340
 then he learned animation and good the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.979
 result was excellent because what it does not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.469
 he knew how to draw came out drawing and came out 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.350
 encouraging but for example I tell you that the 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.570
 person who does 3d also works in 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.150
 these tables are animation 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.829
 traditional but is not required to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 reach a level of detail in the 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.030
 simply draw that you can enjoy is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.829
 a line of action what we call a 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.170
 axis of the character now like to be 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.400
 so that the volumes are marked true 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 so you can handle those volumes 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.310
 that they move well and that they have a 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.250
 certain aesthetics or can be done with 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.880
 phosphorites if the person learns 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.750
 handle the balance of the character true 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.000
 the proportions is fine because 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.220
 then they take that to a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 puppet 3d the same as people are 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.810
 motion plus they are already working 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.790
 with a real character I think that 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.659
 is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.189
 It is broad in the field because the person 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.010
 who knows how to draw can be dedicated to 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.400
 make this book 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.569
 to design characters 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.299
 make scenarios and design those too 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.849
 since for the one who draws he has enough 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.470
 enough camera and it was for 3d animation 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.390
 also this little by little they are 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.750
 starting to see more more pieces 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.780
 advertising in 3d not in addition that is 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.330
 like it's more visual 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.670
 good the table a west 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.070
 place the first drawing you would have the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.200
 first picture of the animation and then you 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.090
 is placing more leaves on top then 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.630
 as this has a light you can see the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.270
 previous picture then he followed the guide 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.010
 true movement based on the drawing 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.050
 before then little by little he's creating 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.540
 the illusion of movement 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.250
 well after you have to scan it you have to 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.960
 clean it the drawing a little bit maybe 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.350
 and after good you can take a 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.100
 editing software type the premier or in 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.570
 one of those software and you are given the 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.270
 number of frames per second true or 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.710
 be or you can see the truth that time 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.720
 the character takes them for example to do 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.790
 a walk if I see it very fast good 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.160
 I already know that I have to add more more 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.160
 drawings then there I go back to the table and 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.650
 they were added in 2d animation in the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.850
 second part of the course what we do 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.300
 is to work with software 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.420
 of two really does the same function 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.940
 that the table or I draw a picture 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.920
 truth and then I put it as another sheet 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.600
 in digital and I can see the picture 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.690
 earlier then I'm doing it but 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.520
 with the tablets that is the same but 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.130
 in digital obviously you have to 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.980
 get used to using the tablet what 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.800
 that it seems important to me that not only 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.870
 2d animation people are going to cheer up 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.540
 this in a traditional way is obviously 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.590
 the raw material of them but also 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.140
 3d people who might know sketch 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.450
 true an animation or knowledge let's say the 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.850
 secrets of 2d animation is to say that 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.250
 how to animate picture box because also 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.250
 the machine makes you the interpellations 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.230
 but if you do not know how is that 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.490
 interpolation you're going to be looking at 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.760
 the machine that will usually be 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.270
 something logical and this is not usually 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.270
 or the best
