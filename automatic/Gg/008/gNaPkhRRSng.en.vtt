I'm looking at this at a camera it does
not<00:03:46.730> look<00:03:46.940> bad<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.660> just<00:03:47.870> have<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.230> tweeze<00:03:48.770> it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
not look bad I just have to tweeze it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.260 
not look bad I just have to tweeze it
out<00:03:49.010> some<00:03:49.220> more<00:03:49.400> make<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.760> look<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:50.000> little<00:03:50.090> bit

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
out some more make it look a little bit

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.140 
out some more make it look a little bit
more<00:03:50.420> wider<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.650> um<00:03:51.950> is<00:03:52.670> definitely

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
more wider and um is definitely

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.730 
more wider and um is definitely
something<00:03:53.330> manageable<00:03:53.870> but<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.710> a

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
something manageable but this is just a
