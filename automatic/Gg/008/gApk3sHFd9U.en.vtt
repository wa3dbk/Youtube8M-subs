defense was designed to be this way and
so<00:01:37.770> every<00:01:38.369> newbie<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> world<00:01:39.030> could<00:01:39.329> just

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
so every newbie in the world could just

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
so every newbie in the world could just
constantly<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> kick<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> doing<00:01:41.610> stuff

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
constantly get a kick out of doing stuff

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
constantly get a kick out of doing stuff
like<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.229> me<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> think

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
like this but it's not for me I think

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.520 
like this but it's not for me I think
it's<00:01:43.740> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> lame<00:01:44.070> say<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> least<00:01:45.530> anyway

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's kind of lame say the least anyway

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.170 
it's kind of lame say the least anyway
so<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.890> plan<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.430> doing<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.759> since<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.000> guy's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so I plan on doing this since this guy's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730 
so I plan on doing this since this guy's
night<00:01:48.390> off<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> trying<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> keep<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> tab<00:01:49.710> on

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
what he's doing try to keep his exposé

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.179 
what he's doing try to keep his exposé
down<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> minimum<00:01:52.590> which<00:01:52.799> means<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.100> have

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
down to a minimum which means I'm have

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
down to a minimum which means I'm have
to<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.579> ghouls<00:01:53.880> counting<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.390> top<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
to do a lot of ghouls counting on top of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.620 
to do a lot of ghouls counting on top of
my<00:01:54.780> creeping<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.350> things<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> such<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
my creeping and things of that such and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
my creeping and things of that such and
just<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.750> bears<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.200> gets<00:01:58.350> possession<00:01:58.649> Tim's

are<00:01:59.250> probably<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.579> worst<00:01:59.700> fear<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.600> haven't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
are probably my worst fear I haven't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
are probably my worst fear I haven't
really<00:02:01.380> seen<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.680> cycle<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.250> Russa<00:02:02.750> dead<00:02:03.750> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
really seen much cycle and Russa dead I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.179 
really seen much cycle and Russa dead I
really<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.560> it'd<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
really don't think it'd be all that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.679 
really don't think it'd be all that
effective<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:06.090> they're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.600> to

effective just because they're going to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.219 
effective just because they're going to
send<00:02:06.899> about<00:02:07.110> 15<00:02:07.590> goals<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> guys<00:02:08.610> and

we're<00:02:48.180> biggest<00:02:48.540> problems<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.110> can't<00:02:49.319> really

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
we're biggest problems you can't really

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.850 
we're biggest problems you can't really
rush<00:02:49.739> most<00:02:50.040> races<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.790> cool<00:02:51.000> so

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
noticed since coming back is quite

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.180 
noticed since coming back is quite
simply<00:03:12.319> creeping<00:03:13.319> has<00:03:13.410> become<00:03:13.739> or<00:03:13.950> not

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
simply creeping has become or not

creeping<00:03:14.519> scouting<00:03:14.970> has<00:03:15.060> become<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.629> much

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
creeping scouting has become so much

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.960 
creeping scouting has become so much
more<00:03:15.810> important<00:03:16.379> if<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.069> don't<00:03:17.220> scout<00:03:17.549> just

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
more important if you don't scout just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.580 
more important if you don't scout just
even<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> minute<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.959> know<00:03:18.989> check<00:03:19.290> certain

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
even for a minute you know check certain

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.660 
even for a minute you know check certain
areas<00:03:19.769> are<00:03:19.859> going<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.040> lose<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> game<00:03:20.459> because

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
areas are going to lose the game because

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.789 
areas are going to lose the game because
someone's<00:03:20.970> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.150> build<00:03:21.840> 7h<00:03:22.319> it's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.620> one

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
someone's going to build 7h it's a one

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.170 
someone's going to build 7h it's a one
side<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.160> your<00:03:23.280> base<00:03:23.489> or<00:03:23.670> something<00:03:23.880> or<00:03:24.000> walk

them<00:03:24.359> into<00:03:24.540> your<00:03:24.600> base<00:03:24.780> you're<00:03:24.989> gonna<00:03:25.109> have<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
them into your base you're gonna have a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.440 
them into your base you're gonna have a
whole<00:03:25.350> world<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.739> hurt<00:03:25.889> so<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.400> don't<00:03:27.359> know<00:03:27.420> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
whole world of hurt so I don't know I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.640 
whole world of hurt so I don't know I
think<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.810> kind<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.049> dumb<00:03:28.230> i<00:03:28.349> don't<00:03:28.500> think

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
think it's kind of dumb i don't think

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.319 
think it's kind of dumb i don't think
that<00:03:28.680> stuff<00:03:28.950> should<00:03:29.130> ever<00:03:29.280> happen<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.880> mean<00:03:30.060> I

that stuff should ever happen I mean I

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.970 
that stuff should ever happen I mean I
think<00:03:30.480> scouting<00:03:31.079> should<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.349> important<00:03:31.829> but<00:03:31.920> I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
think scouting should be important but I

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.199 
think scouting should be important but I
think<00:03:32.190> scouting<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.670> make<00:03:32.819> sure<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.090> know

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
think scouting to make sure you know

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.280 
think scouting to make sure you know
your<00:03:33.239> opponent's<00:03:33.750> doing<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.079> should<00:03:34.109> be

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
your opponent's doing you should be

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.080 
your opponent's doing you should be
important<00:03:34.739> not<00:03:35.250> making<00:03:35.549> sure<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.849> know<00:03:35.970> if

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
important not making sure you know if

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.309 
important not making sure you know if

stupid<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:40.470> that's<00:03:40.620> just

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
stupid like that I think that's just

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.870 
stupid like that I think that's just
retarded<00:03:41.340> personally<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:42.389> that's<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:42.810> me

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880

just<00:04:00.440> check<00:04:00.710> around<00:04:00.950> creep<00:04:01.250> what<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.460> can<00:04:03.490> now<00:04:04.490> I

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
just check around creep what I can now I

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.910 
just check around creep what I can now I
already<00:04:04.850> creep<00:04:05.090> those<00:04:05.300> no<00:04:06.290> real<00:04:06.560> surprise

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
already creep those no real surprise

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.800 
already creep those no real surprise
there<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.310> usually<00:04:07.610> happens<00:04:07.970> I'll<00:04:08.570> be<00:04:08.690> able

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
there that usually happens I'll be able

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.000 
there that usually happens I'll be able
to<00:04:08.900> say<00:04:09.020> I<00:04:09.050> don't<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:09.560> need<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.740> take<00:04:09.890> those

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
to say I don't really need to take those

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.650 
to say I don't really need to take those
creeps<00:04:10.340> outside<00:04:10.760> his<00:04:10.880> base<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:11.240> I<00:04:11.270> don't<00:04:11.540> want

creeps outside his base but I don't want

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.480 
creeps outside his base but I don't want
to<00:04:11.720> engage<00:04:11.840> him<00:04:12.140> early<00:04:12.320> on<00:04:12.410> because<00:04:12.620> he<00:04:12.980> can

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
to engage him early on because he can

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.980 
to engage him early on because he can
harass<00:04:13.820> me<00:04:14.030> really<00:04:14.270> well<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.660> there's<00:04:14.900> not

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
because he just he'll run back to his

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.509 
because he just he'll run back to his

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
I'm not sure how much damage all I

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.209 
I'm not sure how much damage all I
should<00:05:27.650> be<00:05:27.710> able<00:05:27.770> to<00:05:27.889> do<00:05:28.009> them<00:05:32.740> but<00:05:33.740> we'll<00:05:34.039> see

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
should be able to do them but we'll see

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:41.390 
should be able to do them but we'll see
what<00:05:34.340> I<00:05:34.370> can<00:05:34.460> do<00:05:34.669> here

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.040 

anyway<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.240> I'm<00:05:42.419> gonna<00:05:42.509> go<00:05:42.630> hit<00:05:42.750> his<00:05:42.870> base

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
anyway so I'm gonna go hit his base

anyway so I'm gonna go hit his base
right<00:05:43.259> now<00:05:43.350> see<00:05:43.680> what<00:05:43.830> I<00:05:43.860> can<00:05:43.919> see<00:05:44.250> what<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.400> can

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
right now see what I can see what I can

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.300 
right now see what I can see what I can
find<00:05:44.550> out<00:05:44.850> here<00:05:47.780> at<00:05:48.780> best<00:05:49.080> or<00:05:49.380> at<00:05:49.560> worst<00:05:49.770> all<00:05:50.130> of

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
find out here at best or at worst all of

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.890 
find out here at best or at worst all of
that<00:05:50.520> is<00:05:50.669> TP<00:05:50.940> out<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.389> you'll<00:05:51.509> probably<00:05:51.630> be

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
that is TP out and you'll probably be

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.420 
that is TP out and you'll probably be
creeping<00:05:52.259> somewhere<00:05:52.590> so<00:05:52.740> we<00:05:52.770> still<00:05:53.039> disrupt

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
creeping somewhere so we still disrupt

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
what he's doing I don't know maybe I

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.080 
what he's doing I don't know maybe I
guess<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:56.009> can<00:05:56.160> hurt<00:05:56.280> him<00:05:56.310> up<00:05:56.490> a<00:05:56.580> little<00:05:56.610> bit<00:05:56.940> in

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
guess I can hurt him up a little bit in

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.020 
guess I can hurt him up a little bit in
some<00:05:57.300> way<00:06:01.460> one<00:06:02.460> of<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.580> things<00:06:02.639> I've<00:06:02.820> really

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
some way one of the things I've really

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.279 
some way one of the things I've really
been<00:06:03.120> struggling<00:06:03.389> though<00:06:03.690> if<00:06:03.840> it's<00:06:04.020> just<00:06:04.199> how

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
been struggling though if it's just how

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.749 
been struggling though if it's just how
to<00:06:04.350> figure<00:06:04.530> out<00:06:04.710> how<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.860> defeat<00:06:05.100> all<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.310> use

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
to figure out how to defeat all the use

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.159 
to figure out how to defeat all the use
of<00:06:05.789> psych<00:06:06.090> defense<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.539> really<00:06:06.960> don't<00:06:07.110> think

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
of psych defense I really don't think

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.629 
of psych defense I really don't think
there's<00:06:07.380> a<00:06:07.470> way<00:06:07.560> because<00:06:07.740> it's<00:06:07.979> just<00:06:08.070> so<00:06:08.280> cheap

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
there's a way because it's just so cheap

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.860 
there's a way because it's just so cheap
that<00:06:08.669> there's<00:06:09.060> not<00:06:09.240> all<00:06:09.360> that<00:06:09.389> much<00:06:09.509> you<00:06:09.750> can

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
that there's not all that much you can

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.050 
that there's not all that much you can
do<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.289> that's<00:06:11.280> just<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.550> big<00:06:11.580> problem<00:06:11.970> they
