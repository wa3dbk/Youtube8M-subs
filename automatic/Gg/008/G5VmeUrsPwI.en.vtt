00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 archives aac sensational admin drags 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.970
 forth also not here does not need 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:46.930
 module and can close it all here and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:49.090
 now I'm going to open a single manifesto 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.300
 and jael back I have to take a 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.670
 I came back more 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.520
 so I have you installed this 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:03.850
 way to take this message and welcome to 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:08.620
 the average az is for you to zoom in 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:13.840
 map you will tell if you notice there in 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.030
 up here it will give far not the last 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.600
 after that where it all tiny 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.989
 it appears the big screen here in the picture 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.480
 on the screen 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:32.050
 here the world my son an altar in 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:34.120
 Then, it's for you. 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.989
 brand or impose what I like in this 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.290
 module the reason for the other key is better 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.239
 that the united kingdom is my opinion 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.890
 for example here is my house 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.709
 the line of the line 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.959
 I came here only the letter m that has the 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:02.709
 options that we know the option I left 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:04.600
 Every name is a show here is one of those 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.600
 things but what interested me was here 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.050
 You come or in powder it has nothing 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.130
 certain is well does not impose in the case he 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.050
 will already create where you are 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:22.100
 if you choose the name time if that is neither 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.850
 it's good or it's supposed to appear he does not map in 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.510
 top 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.970
 his selection so even here you can not 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.490
 to have kaka is like the regime is that 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.700
 You click here what will happen. 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.650
 from here else click was not you want and 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.010
 clickon complete 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.180
 here is good here 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.180
 now the reason for not liking 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.180
 folks 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:57.969
 I came here a little bit far from home. 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:02.469
 I was right if I made a mistake 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:05.949
 go here, click on the house or 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:08.349
 the option is to edit remove the 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:12.009
 teleport site that is to report to 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:17.199
 you click here the dollar or clean there 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:20.169
 told me to stop here 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.929
 so this not enjoying does not have that 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.529
 time running 

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:30.519
 the map on the top it shows of a 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.619
 way better then I follow the laws no 

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:37.439
 things too in my opinion if 

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:44.849
 little the quality and beauty of the business 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:44.849
 It 's kind of ugly 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:55.320
 but I thought it better show 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.320
 so I heard the homage of the animals 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.950
 I'm still not sure how you do it. 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.970
 girl will show the animals nor does it seem 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.970
 showed the molds 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.169
 So 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.500
 here it is blank there it shows 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.610
 stories that he shows to the 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.230
 multiplayer people too then it's the 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.270
 video that is here I hope you guys 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.230

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.810

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.940
