automatic<00:03:22.950> off<00:03:23.280> which<00:03:23.609> i<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.060> little

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
automatic off which i think is a little

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.170 
automatic off which i think is a little
bit<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> down<00:03:25.160> side<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:27.000> so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
bit of a down side to it but it's so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.319 
bit of a down side to it but it's so
cheap<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:28.430> whatever<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.030> one<00:03:30.239> of

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
cheap that whatever so that's one of

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.960 
cheap that whatever so that's one of
those<00:03:30.450> things<00:03:30.510> where<00:03:31.609> you're<00:03:32.609> supposed<00:03:32.730> to

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
kind of like refused to cut to two diet

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.500 
kind of like refused to cut to two diet
because<00:04:45.560> i<00:04:45.890> just<00:04:46.340> wanted<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:46.910> grow<00:04:47.180> out<00:04:47.330> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510

because i just wanted it to grow out and
then<00:04:47.600> i<00:04:47.630> would<00:04:47.840> cut<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.830> would<00:04:49.450> fit

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450

of girlfriends at the beach and this is

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:53.869 
of girlfriends at the beach and this is
what<00:06:52.259> my<00:06:52.349> hair<00:06:52.589> looks<00:06:52.949> like<00:06:53.189> after<00:06:53.429> I've<00:06:53.639> spent

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:53.879 
what my hair looks like after I've spent

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.239 
what my hair looks like after I've spent
the<00:06:53.999> day<00:06:54.179> at<00:06:54.209> the<00:06:54.389> beach<00:06:54.629> and<00:06:54.899> in<00:06:55.619> the<00:06:55.679> picture

the day at the beach and in the picture

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.639 
the day at the beach and in the picture
the<00:06:57.179> background<00:06:57.599> is<00:06:57.749> black<00:06:57.899> because<00:06:58.259> it<00:06:58.529> was

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:58.649 
the background is black because it was

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:00.739 
the background is black because it was
night<00:06:58.859> and<00:06:58.889> the<00:06:59.279> flash<00:06:59.519> did<00:06:59.819> that<00:06:59.999> but<00:07:00.209> it<00:07:00.689> was

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:00.749 
night and the flash did that but it was

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:02.929 
night and the flash did that but it was
really<00:07:00.989> fun<00:07:01.229> it<00:07:01.319> was<00:07:01.379> a<00:07:01.519> bonfire<00:07:02.519> or<00:07:02.699> whatever

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:02.939 
really fun it was a bonfire or whatever

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.749 
really fun it was a bonfire or whatever
about<00:07:03.179> a<00:07:03.209> year<00:07:03.419> ago<00:07:03.449> I<00:07:03.689> think<00:07:04.049> or<00:07:04.639> probably<00:07:05.639> not

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
about a year ago I think or probably not

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.639 
about a year ago I think or probably not
that<00:07:05.969> long<00:07:06.089> I<00:07:06.209> think<00:07:06.329> was<00:07:06.479> in<00:07:06.599> October<00:07:07.109> but<00:07:07.139> it

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:07.649 
that long I think was in October but it

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:09.889 
that long I think was in October but it
was<00:07:07.739> a<00:07:07.769> lot<00:07:08.219> of<00:07:08.279> fun<00:07:08.519> and<00:07:08.669> my<00:07:08.789> hair<00:07:09.089> looks<00:07:09.389> kind

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:09.899 
was a lot of fun and my hair looks kind

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:12.739 
was a lot of fun and my hair looks kind
of<00:07:09.959> like<00:07:10.019> how<00:07:10.289> it<00:07:10.409> does<00:07:10.559> now<00:07:10.889> just<00:07:11.749> naturally

00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:12.749 
of like how it does now just naturally

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:14.359 
of like how it does now just naturally
because<00:07:12.989> it<00:07:13.109> just<00:07:13.229> naturally<00:07:13.769> you<00:07:13.919> know<00:07:14.039> picks

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:14.369 
because it just naturally you know picks

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:20.570 
because it just naturally you know picks
up<00:07:14.549> the<00:07:14.819> moisture<00:07:15.179> or<00:07:15.509> whatever

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.939 

so<00:07:21.270> overall<00:07:21.810> I<00:07:21.960> think<00:07:22.139> this<00:07:22.409> is<00:07:22.470> actually<00:07:22.740> a

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949
