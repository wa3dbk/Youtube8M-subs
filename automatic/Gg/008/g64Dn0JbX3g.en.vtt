 here is a window here we check and in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.660
 If necessary, install

 tick enable device bluetooth 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.130
 detect this computer need it 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.410
 so that other devices can 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.860
 see our computer and could to him 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.490
 connect via bluetooth 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.840

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:52.689
 and when it is over it goes now 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.680
 then our devices will be ready for 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.439

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.030
 direct interaction transfer 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.620

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.199
 opportunities but somehow actually 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.659
 setting up the work of bluetooth we implement 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:38.959
