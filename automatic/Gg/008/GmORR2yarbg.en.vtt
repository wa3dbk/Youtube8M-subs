to to pay attention to is the actual

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.190 
to to pay attention to is the actual
size<00:00:13.970> of<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.240> weld<00:00:14.450> the<00:00:14.630> smaller<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.019> weld

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
size of the weld the smaller the weld

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.390 
size of the weld the smaller the weld
unless<00:00:15.470> you're<00:00:15.620> gonna<00:00:15.710> have<00:00:15.890> to<00:00:15.980> grind<00:00:16.160> off

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
unless you're gonna have to grind off

unless you're gonna have to grind off
now<00:00:17.180> I've<00:00:17.420> already<00:00:17.630> done<00:00:17.750> all<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.910> smoothing

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
now I've already done all the smoothing

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.330 
now I've already done all the smoothing
over<00:00:20.540> here<00:00:20.689> between<00:00:21.470> these<00:00:21.950> two<00:00:22.130> pieces

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
over here between these two pieces

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.400 
over here between these two pieces
there's<00:00:22.669> one<00:00:22.820> here<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:24.079> there's<00:00:24.230> one<00:00:24.290> over

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
there's one here and there's one over

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.100 
there's one here and there's one over
here<00:00:24.619> it's<00:00:25.460> all<00:00:25.550> I've<00:00:25.759> already<00:00:26.090> pretty<00:00:26.930> well

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
here it's all I've already pretty well

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.409 
here it's all I've already pretty well
gone<00:00:27.290> in<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.890> smooth<00:00:28.160> this<00:00:28.340> out<00:00:28.550> this<00:00:29.239> one

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
gone in and smooth this out this one

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.030 
gone in and smooth this out this one
over<00:00:29.599> here<00:00:29.779> obviously<00:00:30.050> haven't<00:00:30.680> touched<00:00:30.800> on

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
over here obviously haven't touched on

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.200 
over here obviously haven't touched on
it<00:00:31.160> at<00:00:31.399> all<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:33.280> first<00:00:34.280> like<00:00:34.579> I<00:00:34.700> said<00:00:34.850> first<00:00:35.060> off

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
it at all so first like I said first off

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.029 
it at all so first like I said first off
make<00:00:35.840> your<00:00:36.020> welds<00:00:36.260> as<00:00:36.350> small<00:00:36.620> as<00:00:36.739> they<00:00:36.859> need<00:00:37.010> to

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
make your welds as small as they need to

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.810 
make your welds as small as they need to
be<00:00:37.149> second<00:00:38.149> I<00:00:38.300> like<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:38.870> use<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.140> flat<00:00:39.260> wheels

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
be second I like to use the flat wheels

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.430 
be second I like to use the flat wheels
instead<00:00:40.820> of<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.510> composite<00:00:42.019> grinders

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
instead of the the composite grinders

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.669 
instead of the the composite grinders
and<00:00:42.710> this<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:43.670> actually<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.030> pretty<00:00:44.469> gritty<00:00:45.469> one

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
and this is actually a pretty gritty one

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.860 
and this is actually a pretty gritty one
this<00:00:45.800> one's<00:00:46.239> so<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:47.300> can<00:00:47.420> get<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.660> light<00:00:47.809> on

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
this one's so you can get the light on

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.770 
this one's so you can get the light on
that<00:00:48.370> 40<00:00:49.370> grit<00:00:50.109> so<00:00:51.109> really<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.160> trick<00:00:52.399> here

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
that 40 grit so really the trick here

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.410 
that 40 grit so really the trick here
keep<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.019> disc<00:00:54.589> as<00:00:54.890> flat<00:00:55.219> as<00:00:55.370> possible<00:00:55.420> don't

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
keep this disc as flat as possible don't

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.599 
keep this disc as flat as possible don't
dig<00:00:56.749> in<00:00:56.960> with<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.589> tip<00:00:57.829> like<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.339> lot<00:00:58.550> of

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
dig in with the tip like that a lot of

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.270 
dig in with the tip like that a lot of
times<00:00:58.789> you'll<00:00:58.969> have<00:00:59.089> to<00:00:59.239> do<00:00:59.329> that<00:00:59.510> with<00:00:59.690> other

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
times you'll have to do that with other

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.770 
times you'll have to do that with other
projects<00:01:01.280> other<00:01:01.399> grinding<00:01:01.850> projects<00:01:02.269> this

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
projects other grinding projects this

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.299 
projects other grinding projects this
one<00:01:03.019> you<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.320> want<00:01:03.499> to<00:01:03.530> keep<00:01:03.679> it<00:01:03.800> as<00:01:03.890> flat<00:01:04.100> as

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
one you just want to keep it as flat as

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.010 
one you just want to keep it as flat as
possible<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:05.440> then<00:01:06.880> you'll<00:01:07.880> see<00:01:08.120> some<00:01:08.420> little

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
possible and then you'll see some little

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.690 
possible and then you'll see some little
craters<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.920> each<00:01:10.040> side<00:01:10.250> when<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.460> get<00:01:10.580> this

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
craters on each side when you get this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.960 
craters on each side when you get this
flat<00:01:11.410> about<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.650> time<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.460> when<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.820> need<00:01:13.910> to

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
flat about that time is when you need to

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.130 
flat about that time is when you need to
come<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.800> with<00:01:15.800> your<00:01:15.920> da<00:01:16.130> sander<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.270> just

start polishing that down right now I've
got<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.410> 60<00:01:21.740> grit<00:01:23.440> sanding<00:01:24.440> disc<00:01:24.620> on<00:01:24.800> there<00:01:25.010> and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
got a 60 grit sanding disc on there and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.480 
got a 60 grit sanding disc on there and
what<00:01:26.690> I'll<00:01:26.780> do<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:26.930> I'll<00:01:27.110> come<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:27.440> then<00:01:28.310> get

what I'll do is I'll come in then get

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.950 
what I'll do is I'll come in then get
the<00:01:28.640> majority<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.210> down<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.480> does<00:01:29.660> take<00:01:29.930> a

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the majority of it down it does take a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.500 
the majority of it down it does take a
lot<00:01:30.170> longer<00:01:30.410> with<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:30.890> than<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.820> does<00:01:32.000> with

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
lot longer with this than it does with

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.260 
lot longer with this than it does with
the<00:01:32.540> grinder<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.010> you<00:01:34.310> don't<00:01:34.580> want<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.850> dig<00:01:35.060> in

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the grinder but you don't want to dig in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.420 
the grinder but you don't want to dig in
you<00:01:35.360> want<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.960> smooth<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.680> look<00:01:37.250> like

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
you want this to be smooth and look like

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.290 
you want this to be smooth and look like
it's<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:37.790> uniform<00:01:38.330> piece<00:01:38.660> so<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.970> biggest

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
it's one uniform piece so the biggest

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.780 
it's one uniform piece so the biggest
tip<00:01:41.450> here<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.780> patience<00:01:42.400> don't<00:01:43.400> get<00:01:43.580> carried

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
tip here is patience don't get carried

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.100 
tip here is patience don't get carried
away<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:45.250> it'll<00:01:46.250> come<00:01:46.430> out<00:01:46.490> looking<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.110> one

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
away and it'll come out looking like one

00:01:48.110 --> 00:02:11.360 
away and it'll come out looking like one
solid<00:01:48.260> piece

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.789 

I<00:02:11.430> got<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.049> welds<00:02:13.379> smoothed<00:02:13.709> down

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
I got all the the welds smoothed down

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.170 
I got all the the welds smoothed down
and<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:15.239> hid<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.569> entire<00:02:15.900> tube<00:02:17.000> finish<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.090> off

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and I hid the entire tube finish it off

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.320 
and I hid the entire tube finish it off
with<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.390> 150<00:02:19.140> grit<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.489> da<00:02:20.819> sander

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
with a 150 grit there on the da sander

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.199 
with a 150 grit there on the da sander
and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.780> use<00:02:22.200> some<00:02:22.409> same<00:02:23.400> old<00:02:23.580> car

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and then just use some same old car
