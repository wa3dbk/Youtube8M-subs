it the loading screens get annoying me

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.819 
it the loading screens get annoying me
doing<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.019> because<00:03:26.200> you're<00:03:26.410> gonna<00:03:26.500> want<00:03:26.709> to

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
doing this because you're gonna want to

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.729

save and exit as you saw me do because

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.199 
save and exit as you saw me do because
the<00:03:29.919> boss<00:03:30.069> is<00:03:30.099> only<00:03:30.489> spawn<00:03:30.700> once<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.060> can't

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.490 
the boss is only spawn once you can't
leave<00:03:31.419> and<00:03:31.569> come<00:03:31.690> back<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.079> have<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.410> actually

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
leave and come back you have to actually

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.699 
leave and come back you have to actually
save<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:32.980> exit<00:03:33.190> completely<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:35.470> is

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
save and exit completely so this is

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.140 
save and exit completely so this is

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
actually what he'll really do

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.819 
actually what he'll really do
you'll<00:03:37.480> sit<00:03:37.780> here<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.139> he'll<00:03:38.230> jump<00:03:38.470> all<00:03:38.709> the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.379 
you get it could have gotten a 62
because<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.930> just<00:04:41.139> got<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.380> DLC<00:04:41.770> oh<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.090> get

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
because I just got the DLC oh and I get

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.300 
because I just got the DLC oh and I get
up<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.570> level<00:04:43.810> 72<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.009> gun<00:04:45.130> could<00:04:45.250> have

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
up to level 72 so the gun could have

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.409 
up to level 72 so the gun could have
been<00:04:45.460> one<00:04:45.580> level<00:04:45.729> higher<00:04:45.910> than<00:04:46.180> me<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.330> I

Hornet the new gun so as you see when I

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.379 
Hornet the new gun so as you see when I
shoot<00:05:32.259> up<00:05:32.470> obviously<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.310> has<00:05:33.430> very<00:05:33.699> bad<00:05:33.940> range

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
shoot up obviously it has very bad range

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.790 
shoot up obviously it has very bad range
and<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:35.919> recoil<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.910> crazy<00:05:37.600> bad<00:05:37.900> but<00:05:38.470> if<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.650> if

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
and it recoil is crazy bad but if you if

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.260

they're<00:05:38.979> close<00:05:39.250> distance<00:05:39.729> it<00:05:39.880> can<00:05:40.000> be<00:05:40.120> deadly

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
they're close distance it can be deadly

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.670 
they're close distance it can be deadly
I<00:05:40.449> have<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.780> be<00:05:40.870> shield<00:05:41.080> on<00:05:41.229> now<00:05:41.410> when<00:05:41.590> I'm

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
had a lot of health he just died but

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.330 
had a lot of health he just died but
it's<00:05:48.610> whatever<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.630> took<00:05:49.720> happened<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:51.310> I

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
it's whatever it took happened so I

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.740 
it's whatever it took happened so I
really<00:05:51.789> enjoyed<00:05:52.030> a<00:05:52.060> Hornet<00:05:52.419> it's<00:05:52.539> actually

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
really enjoyed a Hornet it's actually

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.689 
really enjoyed a Hornet it's actually
one<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:52.870> my<00:05:52.930> hero<00:05:53.139> guns<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.560> cuz<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.250> gun<00:05:54.460> you

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
one of my hero guns and cuz the gun you

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.340 
one of my hero guns and cuz the gun you
can<00:05:54.819> actually<00:05:54.940> get<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.180> level<00:05:55.419> zero<00:05:55.720> Hornet<00:05:56.169> and

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
can actually get a level zero Hornet and

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.140 
can actually get a level zero Hornet and
you<00:05:57.220> can<00:05:57.340> use<00:05:57.460> it<00:05:57.580> from<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.759> start<00:05:58.000> of<00:05:58.060> the

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
you can use it from the start of the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.870 
you can use it from the start of the
game<00:05:58.300> it's<00:05:58.569> probably<00:05:59.020> going<00:05:59.110> up<00:05:59.199> to<00:05:59.319> level<00:05:59.880> it

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
game it's probably going up to level it

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.029 
game it's probably going up to level it
probably<00:06:01.270> has<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.419> twenty<00:06:01.840> damage<00:06:02.229> when<00:06:02.949> you

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
probably has a twenty damage when you

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.770 
probably has a twenty damage when you
get<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.250> at<00:06:03.370> first<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:03.940> with<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.569> rate<00:06:04.750> of

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
get it at first and with the rate of

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.839 
get it at first and with the rate of
fire<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.470> could<00:06:05.620> probably<00:06:05.740> get<00:06:06.099> a<00:06:06.130> global<00:06:06.520> 10

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
fire that could probably get a global 10

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.999 
fire that could probably get a global 10
