00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
some control right here on the line

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.310 
some control right here on the line
these<00:00:17.400> are<00:00:17.460> low-lying<00:00:17.940> connectors<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.260> you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.960 
beast and you'll hear that when you
listen<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.689> playback<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:53.130> you're

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
listen to the playback but you're

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.240 
listen to the playback but you're
essentially<00:01:54.630> recording<00:01:55.290> directly<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
essentially recording directly off of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.240 
essentially recording directly off of
here<00:01:56.549> using<00:01:57.540> an<00:01:57.630> analog<00:01:58.079> type<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.740> recording

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
here using an analog type of recording

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.039 
here using an analog type of recording
so<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.329> record<00:02:00.869> here

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so that's how you actually record here

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.679 
so that's how you actually record here
let's<00:02:01.229> let's<00:02:01.530> try<00:02:01.649> another<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.280> recording

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
let's let's try another way of recording

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.689 
let's let's try another way of recording
next
