00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.480 

okay<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.290> step<00:00:02.280> two<00:00:02.520> and<00:00:02.959> I<00:00:03.959> remarked<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay so step two and I remarked the the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.220 
okay so step two and I remarked the the
marking<00:00:05.970> hope<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.690> see<00:00:06.870> them<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> bit

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
marking hope you can see them a bit

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.759 
marking hope you can see them a bit
better<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:09.210> idea<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:10.080> you're<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
better the idea is that you're going to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.099 
better the idea is that you're going to
take<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:12.410> mark<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:14.690> receive<00:00:15.690> edge

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
take the first mark to receive edge

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.710 
take the first mark to receive edge
their<00:00:17.539> second<00:00:18.539> mark<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> next<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.189> so

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
their second mark to the next one and so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.500 
their second mark to the next one and so
on<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.220> should<00:00:23.519> match

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
on so you can see that it should match

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.089 
on so you can see that it should match
up<00:00:24.539> hopefully<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> I'm

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
up hopefully you can see that so I'm

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
up hopefully you can see that so I'm
just<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> fill<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.150> obviously<00:00:31.050> what

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
just going to fill that obviously what

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.750 
just going to fill that obviously what
you<00:00:31.949> should<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.640> pin<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:34.579> because<00:00:35.579> then

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you should do is pin it because then

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
you should do is pin it because then
it'll<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.059> lot<00:00:36.210> more<00:00:36.270> accurate<00:00:39.739> surface

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.660 

filling<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.609> would<00:00:44.820> work<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.269> better<00:00:46.670> but

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
filling it would work a lot better but

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
filling it would work a lot better but
giving<00:00:48.269> Swiss<00:00:48.750> demo<00:00:51.469> just<00:00:52.469> saying<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:54.140> try<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
giving Swiss demo just saying to try and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.369 
giving Swiss demo just saying to try and
just<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.309> fitting<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.310 

so<00:01:00.730> already<00:01:01.730> missed<00:01:01.940> my<00:01:02.120> court<00:01:02.359> rinse<00:01:02.629> off<00:01:02.960> so

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
so already missed my court rinse off so

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.179 
so already missed my court rinse off so
it's<00:01:03.469> going<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.710> be<00:01:03.829> very<00:01:03.859> specific<00:01:04.159> skills

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.940 

and<00:01:09.020> because<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.350> try<00:01:10.729> loop<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.939> itself

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.350 

absolutely<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.979> lot<00:01:16.159> easier<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.140> consent

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.860 

okay<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> trip

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.210 

this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.740> very<00:01:29.190> crooked<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.860> I'm<00:01:31.860> sure<00:01:32.070> you've

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
this is very crooked so I'm sure you've

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.820 
this is very crooked so I'm sure you've
got<00:01:32.280> yahoo<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.250> having<00:01:35.250> done<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:36.650> if<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
got yahoo so having done that if you

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.120 
got yahoo so having done that if you
iron<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.580> scene<00:01:38.910> first<00:01:39.710> before<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> cut

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
iron out that scene first before you cut

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.240 
iron out that scene first before you cut
it<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:42.300> will<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:43.440> have<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.920> lots<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it then you will not have to do lots of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.040 
it then you will not have to do lots of
mining<00:01:44.610> afterwards<00:01:45.890> paletas<00:01:46.890> no<00:01:48.050> inside

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
mining afterwards paletas no inside

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.620 
mining afterwards paletas no inside
house<00:01:49.430> okay<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> didn't<00:01:50.700> sit<00:01:50.910> very<00:01:50.940> well<00:01:51.330> it's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
house okay I didn't sit very well it's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
house okay I didn't sit very well it's
not<00:01:51.810> lined<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.290> very<00:01:52.590> well<00:01:52.760> but<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> see

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
not lined up very well but you can see

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.030 
not lined up very well but you can see
that<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.690> were<00:01:54.810> taking<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.320> time<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.740> doing<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that you were taking a time and doing a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.760 
that you were taking a time and doing a
profit<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.760> line<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.620> all

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
profit would line up you then have all

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
profit would line up you then have all
these<00:01:58.950> marks<00:01:59.490> they've<00:02:00.390> kept<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:01.020> because

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
these marks they've kept it is because

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.200 
these marks they've kept it is because
you<00:02:01.500> must<00:02:01.680> stop<00:02:01.950> set<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.400> if<00:02:02.580> when<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
you must stop set it if when you got to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.870 
you must stop set it if when you got to
line<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.720> before<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.320> saw<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.650> it's<00:02:05.580> not

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
line it up before you saw it it's not

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880 
line it up before you saw it it's not
offset<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.290> you've<00:02:07.470> gone<00:02:07.620> wrong

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
offset then you know you've gone wrong

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
offset then you know you've gone wrong
somewhere<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.270> long<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.480> it's<00:02:09.780> offset<00:02:10.910> by

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
somewhere but as long as it's offset by

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.800 
somewhere but as long as it's offset by
the<00:02:12.540> width<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.530> binding<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.130> want<00:02:14.810> then

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
the width of the binding you want then

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.230 
the width of the binding you want then
once<00:02:16.020> you've<00:02:16.230> done<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
once you've done that and so on that

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
once you've done that and so on that
second<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:24.810> round<00:02:25.050> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
second see you can then go round and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.500 
second see you can then go round and
round<00:02:25.350> as<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:28.290> windmills<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.980> your<00:02:29.040> mind

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
round as in like windmills of your mind

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.500 
round as in like windmills of your mind
and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.369 

it's<00:02:36.080> easier<00:02:36.650> if<00:02:37.159> you<00:02:37.430> turn<00:02:37.819> it<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.080> the

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
it's easier if you turn it so that the

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.309 
it's easier if you turn it so that the
right<00:02:39.890> side<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.400> facing<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.060> why<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:42.110> see

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
right side is facing you why you can see

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.429 
right side is facing you why you can see
I've<00:02:42.590> missed<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> mark<00:02:43.159> there<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.840> suppose

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
I've missed the mark there but I suppose

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.809 
I've missed the mark there but I suppose
it<00:02:45.620> doesn't<00:02:45.799> matter<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.220> depends<00:02:46.549> what<00:02:46.670> you're

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
it doesn't matter it depends what you're

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.970 
it doesn't matter it depends what you're
using<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.239> for<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.689> how<00:02:47.840> whatever<00:02:48.530> because

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
using it for and how whatever because

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.740 
using it for and how whatever because
when<00:02:49.189> you<00:02:49.340> when<00:02:49.730> you've<00:02:49.909> turned<00:02:50.209> ilithyia

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
when you when you've turned ilithyia

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.750 
when you when you've turned ilithyia
bias<00:02:51.049> binding<00:02:51.409> edges<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.250> on<00:02:52.310> as<00:02:52.459> long<00:02:52.640> as

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
bias binding edges and so on as long as

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.250

with that you want and it's almost a

with that you want and it's almost a
moot<00:02:59.599> point<00:02:59.769> when<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.890> get<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> bit<00:03:01.609> where

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
moot point when you get to the bit where

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.270 
moot point when you get to the bit where
you've<00:03:02.450> got<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.900> extra<00:03:03.290> which<00:03:03.799> you're<00:03:04.010> bound

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
you've got the extra which you're bound

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.270 
you've got the extra which you're bound

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
to get there anyway you wouldn't get any

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
extra any wastage like that is if you

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.670 
extra any wastage like that is if you
work<00:03:13.970> out<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:15.170> length<00:03:15.409> of<00:03:15.680> your<00:03:17.440> diagonals<00:03:18.440> on

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
work out the length of your diagonals on

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.869 
work out the length of your diagonals on
the<00:03:18.920> square<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:19.639> that<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.480> divisible<00:03:20.810> by<00:03:21.879> the

the square if that is divisible by the

the square if that is divisible by the

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
width of your bias binding because then

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.899 
width of your bias binding because then
when<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.430> mark<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.049> but<00:03:27.049> then<00:03:27.230> as<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.530> see

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
when you mark it but then as you can see

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.009 
when you mark it but then as you can see
did<00:03:28.909> you<00:03:29.000> end<00:03:29.180> up<00:03:29.359> with<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.950> other<00:03:31.989> which<00:03:32.989> is

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
did you end up with that other which is

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.920 
did you end up with that other which is
d<00:03:33.560> down<00:03:33.769> good<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.849> not<00:03:35.120> as<00:03:35.299> good<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.599> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
d down good it's not as good as the

d down good it's not as good as the
other<00:03:36.049> one<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.319> did<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.709> earlier<00:03:36.920> when<00:03:37.069> I<00:03:37.129> wasn't

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
other one I did it earlier when I wasn't

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.220 
other one I did it earlier when I wasn't
in<00:03:37.639> such<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:37.879> hurry<00:03:38.120> ways<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.840> can<00:03:38.989> see<00:03:39.200> that

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
in such a hurry ways you can see that

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.879 
in such a hurry ways you can see that
was<00:03:39.620> lined<00:03:39.859> up<00:03:40.040> better<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.989> if<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.440> lined<00:03:42.709> up

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
was lined up better and if it's lined up

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.229 
was lined up better and if it's lined up
all<00:03:43.099> straight<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.730> you're<00:03:43.879> not<00:03:43.970> rushing

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
all straight and you're not rushing

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.949 
all straight and you're not rushing
along<00:03:44.599> then<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:45.739> should<00:03:45.949> end<00:03:46.099> up<00:03:46.250> with<00:03:46.310> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
along then you should end up with it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.460 
along then you should end up with it
straight<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:49.129> they<00:03:50.120> go<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.359> I<00:03:50.720> hope<00:03:51.049> your<00:03:51.230> class

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
straight so they go to I hope your class

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.150 
straight so they go to I hope your class
can<00:03:51.859> them<00:03:53.230> now<00:03:54.230> make<00:03:54.500> continuous<00:03:54.980> fire

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
can them now make continuous fire

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.669 
can them now make continuous fire
