00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
time you try this in the gym or at home

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.769 
time you try this in the gym or at home
you<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:16.859> most<00:00:17.430> people<00:00:17.580> spend<00:00:17.970> way<00:00:18.510> too<00:00:18.539> much

you see most people spend way too much

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.500

time<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.500> energy<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:20.220> their<00:00:20.789> warm-up<00:00:21.210> steps

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
time and energy on their warm-up steps

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.540 
time and energy on their warm-up steps
so<00:00:22.230> by<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.470> time<00:00:22.590> actually<00:00:23.010> get<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> their

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
so by the time actually get to their

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
so by the time actually get to their
heavy<00:00:23.820> result<00:00:24.300> producing<00:00:24.689> sets<00:00:24.930> they're

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
heavy result producing sets they're

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
heavy result producing sets they're
literally<00:00:25.920> burnt<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.460> too<00:00:26.670> tired<00:00:27.000> to

literally burnt out and too tired to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.779 
literally burnt out and too tired to
perform<00:00:27.539> them<00:00:27.689> well<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> key<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.859> start

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
perform them well so the key is start

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.939 
perform them well so the key is start
reducing<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.510> number<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> warm-up<00:00:31.410> reps<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
reducing the number of warm-up reps and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.370 
reducing the number of warm-up reps and
sets<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.110> exercises

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
sets that you do on all your exercises

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920 
sets that you do on all your exercises
before<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> heavy<00:00:35.730> lifts<00:00:36.120> take

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
before you get to the heavy lifts take

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.650 
before you get to the heavy lifts take
the<00:00:37.170> bench<00:00:37.649> press<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.070> example<00:00:38.550> say<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.600> you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the bench press for example say that you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.130 
the bench press for example say that you
go<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.350> start<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:41.040> 135<00:00:42.000> pounds<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
go in and you start with 135 pounds and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
go in and you start with 135 pounds and
you<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.739> an<00:00:43.829> easy<00:00:43.980> light<00:00:44.579> set<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> 10

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
you do that for an easy light set of 10

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.049 
you do that for an easy light set of 10
reps<00:00:45.710> well<00:00:46.710> instead<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> doing<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.820> more

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
reps well instead of doing that or more

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.080 
reps well instead of doing that or more
again<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.660> another<00:00:48.840> 10<00:00:49.200> 10<00:00:49.920> reps<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> again

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
again for another 10 10 reps and again

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670 
again for another 10 10 reps and again
after<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.690> another<00:00:51.809> time<00:00:51.930> ten<00:00:52.440> reps

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
after that for another time ten reps

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
after that for another time ten reps
start<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> reduce<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.699> number<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> reps<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
start to reduce the number of reps that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.889 
start to reduce the number of reps that
you<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:56.760> set<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> set<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you do so your first set is now a set of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.010 
you do so your first set is now a set of
10<00:00:58.109> reps<00:00:58.350> which<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.280> 135<00:00:59.969> pounds<00:01:00.539> well

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
10 reps which you do 135 pounds well

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
10 reps which you do 135 pounds well
your<00:01:01.140> next<00:01:01.410> set<00:01:01.620> only<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.190> six<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> eight<00:01:03.120> reps

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
your next set only do six to eight reps

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.990 
your next set only do six to eight reps
and<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.010> add<00:01:05.220> 20<00:01:05.549> pounds<00:01:05.820> each

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and you know you can add 20 pounds each

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.690 
and you know you can add 20 pounds each
side<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.350> 255<00:01:08.220> pounds<00:01:08.610> or

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
side so you now you're up 255 pounds or

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
side so you now you're up 255 pounds or
whatever<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.299> whatever<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:10.020> but

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
whatever that you whatever you use but

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.140 
whatever that you whatever you use but
you're<00:01:10.799> reducing<00:01:11.220> number<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.549> reps<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.000> now

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you're reducing number of reps so now

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.399 
you're reducing number of reps so now
instead<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> doing<00:01:12.689> ten<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.229> eight

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
instead of doing ten you do an eight

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
instead of doing ten you do an eight
wait<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> few<00:01:14.400> minutes<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> rest<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.479> next

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
wait a few minutes to rest your next

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
wait a few minutes to rest your next
warm-up<00:01:16.080> set<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.500> only<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> four

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
warm-up set now only do three to four

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.760 
warm-up set now only do three to four
reps<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> again<00:01:18.810> increase<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> weight<00:01:19.619> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
reps and again increase the weight on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.289 
reps and again increase the weight on
the<00:01:19.860> other<00:01:19.979> side<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:20.880> you're<00:01:21.000> doing<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the other side so what you're doing is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.050 
the other side so what you're doing is
actually<00:01:21.509> staggering<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:23.340> sets<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.909> when

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
actually staggering your sets that when

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.820 
actually staggering your sets that when
you're<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.450> you're<00:01:24.689> reducing<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> number<00:01:25.650> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you're as you're reducing the number of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
you're as you're reducing the number of
reps<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:27.090> increasing<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
reps that you do you're increasing the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.210 
reps that you do you're increasing the
weight<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.890> actually<00:01:28.950> get

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
weight so by the time you actually get

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.460 
weight so by the time you actually get
to<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.430> heavy<00:01:29.729> sets<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.020> haven't<00:01:31.320> hurt

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
to your heavy sets one you haven't hurt

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
to your heavy sets one you haven't hurt
yourself<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.979> by<00:01:32.100> doing<00:01:32.340> too<00:01:32.460> many<00:01:32.939> warm<00:01:33.270> up

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
yourself up by doing too many warm up

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
yourself up by doing too many warm up
sets<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.140> you've<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:34.439> increased<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
sets but you've also increased the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
sets but you've also increased the
amount<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> weight<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> warm-up<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
amount of weight on the warm-up so that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.569 
amount of weight on the warm-up so that
way<00:01:37.079> you're<00:01:37.229> acclimating<00:01:37.860> yourself<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> those

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
way you're acclimating yourself to those

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.649 
way you're acclimating yourself to those
heavy<00:01:38.820> set<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.040> key<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.939> reduce<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
heavy set so the key is to reduce the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
heavy set so the key is to reduce the
number<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> reps<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.040> your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
number of reps that you do want your

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
number of reps that you do want your
warm<00:01:44.399> ups<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.509> reduce<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
warm ups and you know you can reduce the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.139 
warm ups and you know you can reduce the
number<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> sets<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.770> too<00:01:47.009> by<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.939> means

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
number of sets you do too by all means

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.109 
number of sets you do too by all means
three<00:01:48.780> warm<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.140> sets<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.560> plenty<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.909> you're

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
three warm up sets is plenty if you're

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
three warm up sets is plenty if you're
staggering<00:01:51.720> them<00:01:51.899> properly<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.159> again<00:01:53.430> looked

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
staggering them properly so again looked

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
staggering them properly so again looked
and<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.509> done<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.810> every<00:01:55.079> single

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

and this can be done on every single
exercise<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.130> instead<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.969> doing<00:01:57.240> three
