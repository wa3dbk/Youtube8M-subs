00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello friends in update 098 us 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.919
 waiting for opus yes yes you heard right 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.200
 grandpa finally gets better grandpa 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.509
 not because grandfathers fought for it's a lie 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.710
 but because it is one of the oldest 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.600
 tanks in the game in general, let's order 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 development reduced soil resistance 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.199
 what does it mean it means that tanchik 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 will be faster 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 in practice, I personally do not have much of a change. 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 noticed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 just a little bit i could 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.390
 feel the difference only because 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 that already skated about a thousand battles on 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.480
 this tank is generally a change in speed 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.030
 and the speakers are barely noticeable but in every 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.629
 case they are for the better and it is not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.629
 may not please 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.260
 also developed reduced range of motion 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.269
 if specifically then at 2,100 what is it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.609
 does this mean that when a tank 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.030
 circle circle motion will be less than 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.129
 earlier and now we'll all think a little 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.649
 We know that recently there was a general niche in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.649
 accuracy and now shells without information in 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.990
 center fly very rarely scoops had 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.180
 such a chip turned the barrel 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 and gave from the guard the poor fellow who 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.880
 trying to rush past you in our 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.399
 case the circle of convergence has become smaller and this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.159
 ok but the thing is isa is 7 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.030
 penetration by armor-piercing projectile 250 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 millimeters and this is actually not enough 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 especially against the backdrop of new monstrous pt to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.210
 example t110 and 5 has a break through 258 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.220
 this is better than his grandfather and his 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.220
 just royal stabilization 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.640
 Well, in general , something we somehow distracted 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.220
 let's go back to our grandfather circle 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.620
 information became less plus the guard 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.940
 which is not something that before but still 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.570
 there is and it's good not that super and with 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.510
 We do not stand next to e 5, but 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.990
 I liked to play more comfortable and this 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.990
 the main thing 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 optics 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 so here are friends that flow from everything 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.170
 aforesaid yes exactly 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.750
 also decreased the time the information is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.850
 it is logical because the circle is smaller and if 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.070
 specifically that time reduced 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.620
 three hundredths of second up 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.680
 it's a little but there are fights in which both 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.200
 this time decides and it also gives us 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.270
 opportunity to substitute less while we 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 converge and target weak spots 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.160
 enemy tanks, too, after all 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.790
 does not allow to just shoot 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.130
 silhouette of a tank and still know maybe stupidity 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.980
 but of course in terms of the instrument of change 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.980
 felt very noticeable 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.019
 and so in general what we have now we 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.720
 we have a good armored tank with already 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.200
 not a bad tool for a threesome 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.470
 five 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.349
 but still she pleases me and yet 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.799
 more than I would like of course 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:46.750
 more but who asked us when 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.750
 we want in general, and thanks for that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.340
 Now I want to appeal to people who 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.430
 not yet is a 7 tank forgives mistakes and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.470
 good for beginners 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.609
 I can safely advise to download it 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.470
 because the whole branch is quite playable on it 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.480
 i finish thank you for watching 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.480
 Good luck to all the battles yet
