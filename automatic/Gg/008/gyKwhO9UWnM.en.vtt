00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
rom from the link in the description the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
rom from the link in the description the
next<00:01:37.140> thing<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.860> ahead

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
next thing you want to do is go ahead

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.910 
next thing you want to do is go ahead
and<00:01:38.070> boot<00:01:38.369> into<00:01:39.049> bootloader<00:01:40.049> mode<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.799> then

and boot into bootloader mode and then

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.819 
and boot into bootloader mode and then
into<00:01:41.220> recovery<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.079> we'll<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.229> power<00:01:43.560> off

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
into recovery so we'll just power off

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
into recovery so we'll just power off
the<00:01:44.070> device<00:01:44.310> ok<00:01:44.939> once<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> device<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.630> powered
