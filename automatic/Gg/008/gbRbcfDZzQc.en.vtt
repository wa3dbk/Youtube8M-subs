fishing getting pretty far off the
beaten<00:00:32.219> path<00:00:32.720> so<00:00:33.720> there's<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.019> lot<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.140> things

we<00:00:34.379> kept<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.680> mind<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.920> were<00:00:34.980> building<00:00:35.159> this

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
we kept in mind we were building this

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.360 
we kept in mind we were building this
car<00:00:36.140> first<00:00:37.140> durable<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.100> got<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.309> keep

car first durable you got to keep
durability<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.850> mind<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.050> in

there<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:57.930> 4130<00:00:58.860> chromoly<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.610> arm<00:00:59.970> lower<00:01:00.780> a-arms

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
there a 4130 chromoly a arm lower a-arms

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.640 
there a 4130 chromoly a arm lower a-arms
all<00:01:01.290> you<00:01:01.379> need<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.619> these<00:01:01.739> things<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:03.650> they

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
all you need on these things and they

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
all you need on these things and they
have<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> goldwing<00:01:05.309> shape<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.330> gets

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
have a goldwing shape that really gets

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
have a goldwing shape that really gets
them<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> off<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> rocks<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.070> that's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
them up and off the rocks and that's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.249 
them up and off the rocks and that's
just<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.759> we<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.150> needed<00:01:09.509> just<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:09.930> inch<00:01:10.140> or

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
just will we just needed just an inch or

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.810 
just will we just needed just an inch or
so<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:11.070> two<00:01:11.280> inches<00:01:11.610> taller

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
so and it's probably two inches taller

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
so and it's probably two inches taller
right<00:01:12.060> where<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.329> needs<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
right where it needs to be so you can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.990 
right where it needs to be so you can
kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> set<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.460> walks<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.820> little

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
kind of set it up on your walks a little

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.310 
kind of set it up on your walks a little
bit<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:15.299> driving<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.079> clears

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
bit when you're driving and it clears

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649 
bit when you're driving and it clears
them<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.280> same<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> rear<00:01:18.150> he

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
them and the same thing with the rear he

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
them and the same thing with the rear he
gets<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.930> rear<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.439> above<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.979> skid<00:01:20.250> plate

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
gets that rear up above the skid plate

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
gets that rear up above the skid plate
so<00:01:20.789> you're<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.030> cooking<00:01:21.270> everything<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so you're not cooking everything to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.859 
so you're not cooking everything to
stock<00:01:22.109> radius<00:01:22.549> arms<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.179> straight<00:01:24.539> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
stock radius arms are just straight and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.620 
stock radius arms are just straight and
you<00:01:25.439> hang<00:01:25.649> them<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.890> quite<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.819> give<00:01:27.539> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you hang them up quite a bit so give you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
you hang them up quite a bit so give you
that<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.289> triple<00:01:28.740> plated<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.729> front

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that it's triple plated there the front

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.249 
that it's triple plated there the front
back<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.390> there's<00:01:30.539> actually<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> center<00:01:31.079> place

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
back and there's actually a center place

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.899 
back and there's actually a center place
items<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.069> strongest<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.729> be

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
items they're just as strongest could be

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.599 
items they're just as strongest could be
the<00:01:33.450> Front's<00:01:33.990> use<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> stock<00:01:34.859> hardware

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
the Front's use all the stock hardware

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.399 
the Front's use all the stock hardware
so<00:01:36.109> they're<00:01:37.109> real<00:01:37.229> easy<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.499> put<00:01:37.710> together

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
so they're real easy to put together

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.090 
so they're real easy to put together
alignment<00:01:40.409> issue<00:01:40.499> you<00:01:40.649> not<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.950> anything
