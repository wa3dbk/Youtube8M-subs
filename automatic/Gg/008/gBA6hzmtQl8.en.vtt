00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 Hey, guys, who's talking to me? 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.200
 shock in play and today is to make a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.359
 video a little different than you 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.179
 are you accustomed to seeing my channel 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:41.609
 usually it's a miscellaneous gaming thing 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.670
 and today I as you saw in the title already 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.489
 give me some tips on what people 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.550
 like to see in minecraft based on 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.409
 That I and I like to come in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.030
 so many minecraft gameplay 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.699
 large drivers of small cars 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.739
 which are generally what it is 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.409
 so based this will be totally 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.290
 based on the movie which I like then one 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:08.490
 vacuum well the first thing you have 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.950
 son and to have notion if to make a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.689
 video minecraft is the led is well you in a 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.719
 county is not accustomed to seeing a 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:24.270
 video of nac with oleg bastard né 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:26.399
 it is then even if the nail legg 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.079
 you can not pay attention 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.100
 right in the game you end up getting 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.109
 nervous 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.930
 Do you know when you're playing in your 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:39.539
 home and this happens 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.950
 anyway it 's also for who is 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.049
 watching your video 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.729
 so if you want to make a flash video 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.350
 you can not have delivered 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.939
 I do not know if you are with my lego here 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.119
 I have to find a way that does not 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.990
 stay with web is but there you are 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.840
 Can you talk if you have gregg? 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.170
 and such a state is something else that you 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.080
 can is to do so you have a 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.470
 best quality of minecraft is and if 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.110
 you are a small county channel 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:20.290
 So it's a county is real so my 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:23.060
 god at funk soon advice is not a team 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.510
 do not have to make it so adventure 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.400
 you know why your small channel 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.350
 people will join your channel to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.090
 try to see something new to be able to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.100
 subscribe to your channel 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.920
 so if you're doing an adventure mode 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.769
 so I do not get target characters and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.380
 I really like to see adventures modes. 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.500
 to be able to know how to play better and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.660
 As I already did, it was worth it as I did. 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.019
 discuss the monarch lion channel 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.019
 setur 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.180
 I think that's what you could have 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:00.079
 varieties and doing something different is 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.850
 is to do of mode or so like business 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.739
 different kind I do not know 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.540
 a parkour screen that is one thing that 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.329
 It was ours that you have skill in 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.609
 game like that does not like to see just doing 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.480
 so I think it's really cool and so 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.430
 that I signed up for is not usually 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.950
 there is no more variety there if you 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.470
 you're doing a campaign mode like that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.739
 I 'm not so excited about this one of yours. 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.780
 video because it can get boring sometimes 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.780
 the video stays too long opa 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.859
 video can be long and staff can 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.420
 not liking so it can get annoying until 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.450
 for who watches the drug 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.640
 Look who's watching your channel. 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.230
 Money coming and thinking here I am 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.750
 making a totally random video 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.300
 I do not think anything that I'm talking about 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.360
 advice is listening to a funk behind is 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.090
 case of my visit here 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.060
 business comes too scrotum the word does not 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.810
 was accepted 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.360
 Let's see something about something. 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.260
 important that I do not know if I have 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.519
 I do not know if there's a lot of it there. 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.329
 I'm good 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.590
 it is the narration is to be active in the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.240
 narration the main things in me i 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.880
 I have enough so do not stutter you 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.540
 ship stuttered mg 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.790
 Now I try not to stutter I know it's 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.270
 a difficult thing to do not see 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.790
 that already but it is good to try because there are people 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.930
 who has no patience with who 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.110
 he stutters a lot and can not tie the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.030
 what are you doing in the video is something 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.580
 boring that happens too I do not care 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.590
 much the contract narration that is the 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.169
 good quality of life that I can 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.919
 watch on a legal ht 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.820
 I mean, I can call because of what 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.590
 depending on what the person is 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.600
 presenting a mod 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.770
 if she does not explain a mod well I do not 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.320
 I'll like her video and 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.440
 consequently can serve to stay 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.810
 very very bad I can talk because neither 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.729
 everyone likes that just tells us 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.020
 comments but I can speak each type 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.770
 Nothing, even though you said something. 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.010
 like this 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.320
 It's annoying to talk but I eat. 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.500
 viewer at the time of my opinion 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.050
 about whether or if I find it so 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.270
 It was not good, I'm not going to help. 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.050
 dislike I'm going to talk to our guy 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.630
 This was strange and it was different. 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.389
 and this is what I will try to do without 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.220
 annoying person because you do not know me 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.289
 I know if you do not play a game you do not 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.440
 You know the work here that you can edit. 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.639
 a not so good computer to render 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.949
 It's annoying, somebody talking like that. 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.780
 with good but it's the reality if you too 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.689
 has a channel or is it ready to 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.499
 you can receive the criticisms 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:01.569
 necessary and everything else so I guess 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:04.569
 what is this if you have any idea i 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.240
 more things you can talk to 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:11.139
 next civil video did I go 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.629
 to think if I will do is can comment and there 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.999
