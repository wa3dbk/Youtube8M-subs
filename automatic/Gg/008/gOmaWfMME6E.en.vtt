00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
is recommended to run a run this on a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
is recommended to run a run this on a
1000<00:00:55.920> watt<00:00:56.100> power<00:00:56.340> supply<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.190> here's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
1000 watt power supply and then here's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.599 
1000 watt power supply and then here's
some<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.329> adapters<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
some more adapters it looks like you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.539 
some more adapters it looks like you
might<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> solder<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.710> your

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
might actually have to solder on your

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.080 
might actually have to solder on your
own<00:01:06.350> plugs<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:10.070> they<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.220> come<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
own plugs so they don't come with a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
own plugs so they don't come with a
solder<00:01:12.930> already<00:01:13.530> pre<00:01:14.369> attached<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.619> you're

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
solder already pre attached so if you're

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.460 
solder already pre attached so if you're
not<00:01:17.070> too<00:01:17.700> familiar<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:18.150> soldering<00:01:18.630> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
not too familiar with soldering you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
not too familiar with soldering you
might<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> research<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
might want to research how to do that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
might want to research how to do that
because<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.200> solder<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> your

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
because you will have to solder on your

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.749 
because you will have to solder on your
own<00:01:23.400> characters<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.610> here's<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
own characters and then here's the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.370 
own characters and then here's the
charger<00:01:27.450> I'll<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> box<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> way

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.619 
just one button so i've not had to do
too<00:02:46.560> much<00:02:46.680> programming<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.359> see<00:02:48.599> right

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
too much programming you can see right

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.660 
too much programming you can see right
here<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:49.139> there's<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.739> balance<00:02:50.190> port<00:02:50.489> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
here that there's one balance port and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.809 
here that there's one balance port and
you<00:02:50.909> can<00:02:51.120> plug<00:02:51.329> your<00:02:51.599> board<00:02:52.109> into<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:52.819> you

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
you can plug your board into that or you

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can plug your board into that or you
can<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.150> plug<00:02:54.769> if<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> standard

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
can just plug if you have a standard

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.929 
can just plug if you have a standard
plug<00:02:57.450> here<00:03:00.829> you<00:03:01.829> can<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.370> plug<00:03:02.790> in

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
plug here you can actually just plug in

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.099 
plug here you can actually just plug in
your<00:03:03.060> standard<00:03:03.629> battery<00:03:04.220> straight<00:03:05.220> into<00:03:05.489> that

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
your standard battery straight into that

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.360 
your standard battery straight into that
like<00:03:07.109> i<00:03:07.290> did<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.889> that's<00:03:10.069> if<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.159> have

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
like i did there and that's if you have

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.479 
like i did there and that's if you have
one<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.760> your<00:03:11.970> standard<00:03:12.420> balance<00:03:12.810> crackers

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
one of your standard balance crackers

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.610 
one of your standard balance crackers
like<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:15.019> there's<00:03:16.019> your<00:03:16.200> temperature

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
like this there's your temperature

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.729 
like this there's your temperature
sensor<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.340> can<00:03:17.519> go<00:03:17.699> with<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.910> 6s<00:03:18.359> lipo

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
sensor it can go with the 6s lipo

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.210 
sensor it can go with the 6s lipo
there's<00:03:19.739> your<00:03:19.949> output<00:03:20.370> fan<00:03:21.949> same<00:03:22.949> thing<00:03:23.129> on

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
there's your output fan same thing on

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.970 
there's your output fan same thing on
the<00:03:23.310> other<00:03:23.340> side<00:03:23.540> output<00:03:24.799> balancing<00:03:25.799> point

this is perfect if you have like a high

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.200 
this is perfect if you have like a high
charge

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
charge

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.570 
charge
battery<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:27.960> gens<00:04:28.770> ace<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:29.190> know<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.460> they

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
battery like gens ace I know that they

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.520 
battery like gens ace I know that they
can<00:04:29.759> be<00:04:29.850> charged<00:04:30.150> up<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.419> five<00:04:30.660> times<00:04:31.350> their

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
can be charged up to five times their

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.390 
can be charged up to five times their
cell<00:04:31.800> capacity<00:04:31.949> so<00:04:32.669> if<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.660> had<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:34.400> five

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
cell capacity so if you had a five

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.430 
cell capacity so if you had a five
thousand<00:04:36.180> million<00:04:36.479> power<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.900> gens<00:04:37.199> ace

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
thousand million power of gens ace

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.129 
thousand million power of gens ace
battery<00:04:37.919> you<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.340> charge<00:04:38.759> that<00:04:39.120> at<00:04:39.360> 20<00:04:39.780> amps

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
battery you can charge that at 20 amps

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.969 
battery you can charge that at 20 amps
with<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:40.860> charger<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:42.539> will<00:04:42.750> get<00:04:42.979> the

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
with this charger and that will get the

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.189 
with this charger and that will get the
battery<00:04:44.310> done<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.789> under<00:04:45.090> 20<00:04:45.630> minutes<00:04:45.660> for

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
battery done in under 20 minutes for

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.770 
battery done in under 20 minutes for
your<00:04:46.289> charge<00:04:46.590> time<00:04:46.889> maybe<00:04:47.699> it<00:04:47.880> in<00:04:47.970> 15<00:04:48.419> minutes

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
your charge time maybe it in 15 minutes

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.770 
your charge time maybe it in 15 minutes
it<00:04:49.080> all<00:04:49.229> depends<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.710> how<00:04:50.449> discharged<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.660> how

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
it all depends on how discharged and how

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.499 
it all depends on how discharged and how
charge<00:04:52.110> your<00:04:52.560> battery<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:54.090> got<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.270> ton<00:04:54.479> of
