00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.979 
YouTube
it<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.829> wouldn't<00:03:21.220> update<00:03:21.669> properly<00:03:22.209> even<00:03:22.900> if

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it just wouldn't update properly even if

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.210 
it just wouldn't update properly even if
it's<00:03:23.109> updated<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.950> wouldn't<00:03:24.519> play<00:03:25.419> the<00:03:25.750> video

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it's updated it wouldn't play the video

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.490 
it's updated it wouldn't play the video
so<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:28.180> was<00:03:28.329> second<00:03:28.659> one<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.079> I<00:03:29.109> did<00:03:29.230> was

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
so that was second one so what I did was

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.789 
so that was second one so what I did was
hooked<00:03:29.739> up<00:03:29.950> my<00:03:30.159> computer<00:03:30.700> via<00:03:31.299> HDMI<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.590> I'm

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
hooked up my computer via HDMI so I'm

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.550 
hooked up my computer via HDMI so I'm

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
playing videos and movies to it so I

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.729 
playing videos and movies to it so I
figured<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:39.699> could<00:03:39.940> ship<00:03:40.569> this<00:03:40.720> back<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.290> get<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
figured I could ship this back and get a

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.640 
figured I could ship this back and get a
plasma<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.690> same<00:03:43.900> price<00:03:44.139> point<00:03:44.169> I<00:03:44.470> could

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
plasma at the same price point I could

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.969 
plasma at the same price point I could
get<00:03:44.859> LG<00:03:45.669> or<00:03:45.940> TCL<00:03:47.099> plasma<00:03:48.099> for<00:03:48.750> 750<00:03:49.750> $800<00:03:50.680> so

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
get LG or TCL plasma for 750 $800 so

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:55.920

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:12.059 
shipping it back only because you know I

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.509 
shipping it back only because you know I
I'm<00:06:12.360> not<00:06:12.569> I<00:06:12.809> wasn't<00:06:13.349> happy<00:06:13.529> with<00:06:13.709> the<00:06:13.949> display

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:14.519 
I'm not I wasn't happy with the display

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:20.329 
I'm not I wasn't happy with the display
and<00:06:14.899> I<00:06:15.899> wanted<00:06:16.379> deep<00:06:16.979> blacks<00:06:17.449> and<00:06:19.309> probably<00:06:20.309> a

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:20.339 
and I wanted deep blacks and probably a

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.209 
and I wanted deep blacks and probably a
bit<00:06:20.519> more<00:06:20.759> crisper<00:06:21.179> display<00:06:21.569> so<00:06:21.839> I<00:06:21.869> thought<00:06:22.319> at

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
bit more crisper display so I thought at

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.909 
bit more crisper display so I thought at
the<00:06:23.489> same<00:06:23.699> price<00:06:24.089> I<00:06:24.329> could<00:06:24.509> get<00:06:24.929> a<00:06:24.959> plasma<00:06:25.289> and

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
the same price I could get a plasma and

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.219 
the same price I could get a plasma and
hook<00:06:26.759> up<00:06:26.939> my<00:06:27.319> PC<00:06:28.319> and<00:06:28.349> I<00:06:28.619> can<00:06:28.829> watch<00:06:29.719> videos<00:06:30.719> and

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
hook up my PC and I can watch videos and

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.799 
hook up my PC and I can watch videos and
I<00:06:32.009> thought<00:06:32.519> that<00:06:32.759> would<00:06:32.879> be<00:06:32.909> a<00:06:33.059> great<00:06:33.479> option

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:33.809 
I thought that would be a great option

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.519 
I thought that would be a great option
great<00:06:34.799> way<00:06:35.099> to<00:06:35.129> go<00:06:35.489> because<00:06:35.669> I'm<00:06:35.969> and<00:06:36.959> I<00:06:37.079> would

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
great way to go because I'm and I would
