crusher<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:46.070> saw<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.820> in<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.810> picture<00:01:48.320> of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
crusher I saw that in the picture of

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.120 
crusher I saw that in the picture of
Francis<00:01:49.910> that<00:01:50.090> she<00:01:50.270> had<00:01:50.450> really<00:01:51.130> standout

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
Francis that she had really standout

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.609 
Francis that she had really standout
lashes<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.030> think<00:01:53.330> it's<00:01:53.750> very<00:01:53.869> important<00:01:54.470> to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
lashes so I think it's very important to

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.230 
lashes so I think it's very important to
use<00:01:54.740> an<00:01:54.830> eyelash<00:01:55.190> curler<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.970> want<00:01:56.149> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
use an eyelash curler if you want the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.990 
use an eyelash curler if you want the
same<00:01:56.450> effect<00:01:57.130> here<00:01:58.130> I'm<00:01:58.190> just<00:01:58.310> using<00:01:58.430> my<00:01:58.759> blush

same effect here I'm just using my blush

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.420 
same effect here I'm just using my blush

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
Teresa sounds raised by Rimmel and it's

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.120 
Teresa sounds raised by Rimmel and it's
a<00:02:01.580> very<00:02:01.820> very<00:02:02.270> natural<00:02:02.509> blush<00:02:03.500> but<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.009> main

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
a very very natural blush but the main

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.859 
a very very natural blush but the main
focus<00:02:04.520> here<00:02:04.700> was<00:02:04.789> on<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.090> eyes<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.690> lips

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
focus here was on the eyes and the lips

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.600 
focus here was on the eyes and the lips
so<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.410> didn't<00:02:06.679> want<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.890> go<00:02:07.009> over<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.399> top<00:02:07.580> of
