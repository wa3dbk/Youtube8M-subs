NIGEL LYTHGOE: Today is, of
course, the cruelest cut.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.690
It's the first week, and
somebody has to go.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.210
And when we looked at it, and
especially with the girls, we

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.820
didn't want any one of those
girls in the bottom three.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.670
ALAN BERSTEN: Being in
the bottom three

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.504
really woke me up.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:20.448
And it sort of showed me that
I need to dance stronger and

00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:21.478
connect more with my partner.

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:21.890
JASMINE MASON: Yeah.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.480
And hearing the eliminations at
the beginning is so scary.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.405
Him being in the bottom made me
also step up as a partner,

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:31.470
too, because I wanted to keep
him out of that place.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.900
I don't want him
back in there.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.380
We need to stay partners
forever.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.340
STACEY TOOKEY: I don't
like doing it at the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.440
beginning of the show.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.520
It makes me feel unsettled.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.370
MALECE MILLER: I think we were
all just kind of shocked

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.030
because it's just so new.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.270
Because you would just
watch everybody get

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.390
eliminated at the end.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.310
So to do it at the beginning--
it's like a whole new world.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.950
STACEY TOOKEY: From the
performances tonight, I don't

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.710
think Carlos should
have gone home.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.220
And that's not just because
I worked with him.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.480
I really think that he
proved it in the

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.860
solo and in the piece--

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.460
CARLOS GARLAND: The experience
thus far has been so amazing.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.030
Every day-- it's been
a blessing.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.300
And we get to work and
do what we love.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.710
That was kind of hard to start
off the show today with

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.960
getting eliminated.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.330
But hopefully, we showed and
inspired people that even

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.810
though things don't always work
out the way you planned

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.725
for them and hoped for, that
we can always turn into

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:17.150
something great and
still dance.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.010
MARY MURPHY: Brittany Cherry--

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.560
I was blown away.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560
I'm blown away that she's
out of this competition.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.750
That girl was one
of my favorites.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.020
I definitely saw her at least
being in the top six in this

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.040
competition.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.990
I think she does every style.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.170
We saw in Las Vegas Week, she
is just amazing in every

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.370
single style.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.535
BRITTANY CHERRY: You've
got to suck it up.

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:37.250
And this is it.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.810
You've got to put yourself out
there and give it your all and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.300
hope for the best.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.730
MARIAH SPEARS: It was definitely
hard, just knowing

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.510
from the beginning that your
partner's going to go home.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.280
But it made it so much better
during the routine--

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.250
getting to dance that one more
time on the stage with Carlos

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.850
and really dancing for him.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.460
DORIAN "BLUPRINT"
HECTOR: Yeah.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.080
It's a very sad loss, because
we were very close.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.690
TUCKER KNOX: We've grown into
such a family here.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.720
And to lose one of
the members--

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.900
it's really tough.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.670
JENNA JOHNSON: It played with
our emotions, definitely.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.340
But luckily, I think we're all
able to snap out of it.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.840
And even Brittany and Carlos did
amazing in their routine.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.965
It really shows how much we
rely on people's votes.

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:17.240
TUCKER KNOX: Yeah.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.940
JENNA JOHNSON: So please vote.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.850
CAT DEELEY: It was quite a saucy
show tonight, actually.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.680
It was quite out there.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.300
I loved Fik-Shun and Amy.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.580
I have to say, that was my
favorite performance tonight.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.770
They have just the cutest
personalities

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.792
and the best faces.

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:34.060
Their timing is impeccable.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.200
They're just superstars.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.590
You look at them, and they're
just superstars.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.480
AMY YAKIMA: He's never done
hip hop choreography.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.710
He free styles.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.820
And I'm a contemporary
jazz dancer.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.010
So it was a bit out of our
element in general.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.600
DU-SHAUNT "FIK-SHUN" STEGALL:
Once my choreographer said,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
don't worry so much
about the steps.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.010
Use the personality, especially
if my partner's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.870
giving 100% in her chemistry
and her personality.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.190
Then I just feed off that.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.730
At the end of the day, when we
feed off each other, oh, it's

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.420
a great after party.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.780
AMY TAKIMA: Yeah.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.556
It was fun.

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:01.550
It was super fun.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.650
TABITHA DUMO: Amy really
surprised me.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.612
I think I was a little nervous
knowing that it

00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:07.770
was out of her genre.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.229
Blow for blow, she was right
there with Fik-Shun, so I was

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.360
proud of her.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.460
NAPOLEON DUMO: And what
a hard worker.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.030
Yeah, she was great.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.121
And both of them are just a
treat to watch and a treat to

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:16.050
rehearse with.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.180
MARY MURPHY: For sure, Aaron and
Jasmine's performance was

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.190
just amazing.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.750
Again, they're the couple that
I don't think any of us gave

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.770
enough credit to.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.720
And here they are in
their second week,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.060
blowing us away again.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.720
AARON TURNER: I would say,
initially, we had a hard time

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.090
being comfortable.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.650
There was a lot of-- it was
awkward in the beginning,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.820
because we knew that we had to
sell it on our chemistry.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.400
We had to sell it on
our performance.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.925
But that's what we focused on.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.562
And in the end, we were very,
very proud of our work-- what

00:03:43.562 --> 00:03:44.410
we had accomplished.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.430
NAPOLEON DUMO: What's so
important to us within these

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.940
dances is the story that we're
telling and the character.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.560
When they got up on stage, they
both did a fantastic job.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.080
They acted their tails off.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.460
They told the story good.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.590
And then they're bot
sexy and hot.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.550
TABITHA DUMO: What's
not to like.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.750
NAPOLEON DUMO: Yeah, what
more could you ask for?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.390
CAT DEELEY: I think it's going
to be all about celebrating

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.365
people's achievement in
getting this far.

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:08.680
In getting to the top 20, you
are the best of the best.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.400
And I think that's what we
should do-- celebrate their

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.165
huge talents.

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:14.240
ALEXIS JULIANO: I'm
Alexis Juliano.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.390
NICO GREETHAM: And I'm
Nico Greetham.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.640
BOTH: And you're watching
DanceOn.
