come<00:02:11.870> together<00:02:12.500> I'll<00:02:12.680> start<00:02:13.069> by<00:02:13.310> separating<00:02:13.879> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
come together I'll start by separating a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
come together I'll start by separating a
section<00:02:14.510> usually<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.020> separate<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.769> hair<00:02:16.069> in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
section usually I separate my hair in

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.759 
section usually I separate my hair in
half<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.660> after<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.720> separate<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.379> in<00:02:21.500> half

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
half and after I separate it in half

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.220 
half and after I separate it in half
then<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.700> usually<00:02:23.269> separated<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.870> one<00:02:24.050> more

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
then I usually separated it one more

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.130 
then I usually separated it one more
time<00:02:28.720> go<00:02:29.720> ahead<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.080> spray<00:02:30.380> down<00:02:31.569> all<00:02:32.569> the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
clumps everything together and defines

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.899

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
the curl to make that look last I'm

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.159 
the curl to make that look last I'm
gonna<00:05:12.180> grab<00:05:12.449> my<00:05:12.659> gel<00:05:13.020> it's<00:05:13.380> Herbal<00:05:14.280> Essences

you<00:06:59.030> can<00:06:59.060> kind<00:06:59.420> of<00:06:59.510> scrunch<00:06:59.870> it<00:07:00.050> a<00:07:00.110> little<00:07:00.350> bit

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
you can kind of scrunch it a little bit

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.990 
you can kind of scrunch it a little bit
but<00:07:01.580> other<00:07:01.790> than<00:07:02.030> that<00:07:02.320> just<00:07:03.320> leave<00:07:03.500> it<00:07:03.650> alone

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000
