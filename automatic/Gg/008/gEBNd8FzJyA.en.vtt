00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.080 

well<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.380> new<00:00:25.560> split-top<00:00:26.070> roubo<00:00:26.099> workbench<00:00:26.460> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
well my new split-top roubo workbench is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.269 
well my new split-top roubo workbench is
nearly<00:00:27.480> complete<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.039> heck<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
nearly complete and this was one heck of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
nearly complete and this was one heck of
a<00:00:29.460> project<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.119> had<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> great<00:00:30.599> opportunity<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
a project I had a great opportunity to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
a project I had a great opportunity to
practice<00:00:31.619> some<00:00:31.980> old<00:00:32.160> skills<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> learn<00:00:33.120> some

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
practice some old skills and learn some

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120 
practice some old skills and learn some
new<00:00:33.480> ones<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.260> fact<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> those<00:00:34.920> new

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
new ones and in fact one of those new

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
new ones and in fact one of those new
things<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> learned<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> concept<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
things I learned is the concept of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
things I learned is the concept of
tapping<00:00:37.200> holes<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.860> wood<00:00:38.370> basically<00:00:38.910> cutting

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
tapping holes in wood basically cutting

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
tapping holes in wood basically cutting
threads<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.379> use<00:00:40.500> bolts<00:00:40.860> instead

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
threads so that we can use bolts instead

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.250 
threads so that we can use bolts instead
of<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.640> things<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.030> nails<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> screws

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of using things like nails and screws

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440 
of using things like nails and screws
there<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:43.950> some<00:00:44.100> powerful<00:00:44.610> applications<00:00:45.270> for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
there are some powerful applications for

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.819 
there are some powerful applications for
something<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> let<00:00:46.379> me<00:00:46.440> show<00:00:46.620> how

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
something like this so let me show how

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
something like this so let me show how
we<00:00:46.890> used<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.940> bench<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.750> we'll

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
we used it on the bench and then we'll

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
we used it on the bench and then we'll
cut<00:00:49.050> some<00:00:49.079> together<00:00:49.489> pretty<00:00:50.489> much<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
cut some together pretty much all of the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.930 
cut some together pretty much all of the
leg<00:00:51.360> vise<00:00:51.570> components<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.500> benchcrafted

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
leg vise components from benchcrafted

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.180 
leg vise components from benchcrafted
attached<00:00:53.940> via<00:00:54.360> bolts<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.590> threads

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
attached via bolts that go into threads

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
attached via bolts that go into threads
and<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.420> cool<00:00:57.629> thing<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and it's really a cool thing if you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170 
and it's really a cool thing if you
think<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.370> movable<00:00:59.789> parts

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
think about it these are movable parts

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360 
think about it these are movable parts
things<00:01:00.510> may<00:01:00.719> break<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.770> point<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.219> may

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
things may break at some point we may

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
things may break at some point we may
need<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> replace<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> chop<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.350> may<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
need to replace the chop you may need to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080 
need to replace the chop you may need to
make<00:01:04.799> an<00:01:04.920> adjustment<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> hardware<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
make an adjustment to the hardware so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
make an adjustment to the hardware so
it's<00:01:06.510> good<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.900> able<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> take<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> apart

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's good to be able to take it apart

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
it's good to be able to take it apart
here's<00:01:08.549> another<00:01:08.760> example<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.330> roller<00:01:09.659> guide

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
here's another example this roller guide

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
here's another example this roller guide
down<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.860> needs<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> adjust<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.060> hold<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
down here needs to adjust to hold the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.850 
down here needs to adjust to hold the
parallel<00:01:12.900> guide<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
parallel guide in just the right

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
parallel guide in just the right
position<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.729> need<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> make<00:01:15.119> fine

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
position so we need to make fine

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
position so we need to make fine
adjustments<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.409> down

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
adjustments up and down

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
adjustments up and down
so<00:01:17.939> having<00:01:18.180> threaded<00:01:18.780> bolts<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.350> allows<00:01:19.860> us

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so having threaded bolts here allows us

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.859 
so having threaded bolts here allows us
to<00:01:20.220> loosen<00:01:20.549> things<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> adjustment

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
to loosen things up make the adjustment

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
to loosen things up make the adjustment
tighten<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.530> back<00:01:22.650> down<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.670> we're

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
tighten it back down and know that we're

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
tighten it back down and know that we're
not<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:23.939> doing<00:01:24.270> any<00:01:24.479> damage<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> wood

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
not really doing any damage to the wood

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
not really doing any damage to the wood
because<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.280> thread<00:01:26.729> alright<00:01:27.420> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because it's in a thread alright so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
because it's in a thread alright so
let's<00:01:27.990> take<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> look<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.650> traditional

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
let's take a look at some traditional

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.789 
let's take a look at some traditional
ways<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:30.540> hardware<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.350> hold<00:01:31.380> wood

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
ways of using hardware to hold wood

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.620 
ways of using hardware to hold wood
pieces<00:01:32.189> together<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.670> why<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.270> might<00:01:33.450> not

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
pieces together and why they might not

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
pieces together and why they might not
be<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.020> good<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> threaded<00:01:35.310> hole<00:01:35.430> let's<00:01:36.420> look

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
be as good as a threaded hole let's look

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
be as good as a threaded hole let's look
at<00:01:36.720> nails<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.290> nails<00:01:38.009> are<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.520> much<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
at nails first nails are pretty much a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.190 
at nails first nails are pretty much a
brute-force<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.720> holding<00:01:40.049> things

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
brute-force way of holding things

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
brute-force way of holding things
together<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.100> nail<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.460> driven<00:01:41.490> into<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
together the nail is driven into the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
together the nail is driven into the
wood<00:01:42.329> splitting<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.170> compressing<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
wood splitting and compressing the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.370 
wood splitting and compressing the
fibers<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> whole<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.790> over<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.750> natural

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
fibers the whole way over time natural

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
fibers the whole way over time natural
forces<00:01:46.829> will<00:01:47.040> cause<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.520> wood<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.729> compress

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
forces will cause the wood to compress

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
forces will cause the wood to compress
even<00:01:48.750> further<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.320> eventually<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.159> two

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
even further and eventually the two

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.219 
even further and eventually the two
pieces<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.909> come<00:01:51.119> loose<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.049> nail

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
pieces will come loose because the nail

applications where you may need to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
loosen and tighten this thing over and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.920 
loosen and tighten this thing over and
over<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> last<00:02:36.660> much<00:02:36.960> much<00:02:37.020> longer

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.110 

all<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.950> need<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.190> make<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> threaded<00:02:44.730> hole<00:02:44.760> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
all you need to make a threaded hole is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.390 
all you need to make a threaded hole is
a<00:02:45.180> drill<00:02:45.840> bit<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.440> tap<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.920> these<00:02:47.070> are

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
a drill bit and a tap and these are

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
a drill bit and a tap and these are
basically<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.940> matched<00:02:48.360> pair<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:49.260> want<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
basically a matched pair you want to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
basically a matched pair you want to
make<00:02:49.560> sure<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> drill<00:02:50.340> bit<00:02:50.490> clears<00:02:50.880> most

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
make sure that the drill bit clears most

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.390 
make sure that the drill bit clears most
of<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> material<00:02:52.170> out<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.590> leaves<00:02:53.100> just

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
of the material out and leaves just

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.980 
of the material out and leaves just
enough<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.210> tab<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.690> cut<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
enough so that the tab can cut the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.870 
enough so that the tab can cut the
threads<00:02:55.320> appropriately<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.460> if<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.700> want

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
threads appropriately now if you want

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.480 
threads appropriately now if you want
you<00:02:57.240> can<00:02:57.360> actually<00:02:57.540> buy<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.410> tap<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.310> bit

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
you can actually buy the tap and the bit

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.010 
you can actually buy the tap and the bit
in<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.970> set<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
in a set so you know you have the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.930 
in a set so you know you have the
perfect<00:03:01.410> matched<00:03:01.620> pair<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.370> typically<00:03:02.790> these

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
perfect matched pair but typically these

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.760 
perfect matched pair but typically these
are<00:03:03.000> sized<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.690> could<00:03:03.840> look<00:03:03.959> them<00:03:04.140> up<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.560> you

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
are sized you could look them up and you

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.380 
are sized you could look them up and you
can<00:03:04.890> make<00:03:04.920> sure<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.550> right<00:03:05.820> tap<00:03:06.090> set

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
can make sure you get the right tap set

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.210 
can make sure you get the right tap set
with<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> right<00:03:06.840> bit<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.680> course<00:03:07.890> you

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
with the right bit and of course you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.710 
with the right bit and of course you
want<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.400> make<00:03:08.459> sure<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> tap<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
want to make sure that the tap the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.120 
want to make sure that the tap the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
threads that it winds up cutting are

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.160 
threads that it winds up cutting are
perfect<00:03:11.850> for<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.270> bolt<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.750> you're<00:03:12.900> going

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
perfect for the bolt that you're going

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.530 
perfect for the bolt that you're going
to<00:03:13.200> use<00:03:13.500> because<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.520> want<00:03:14.700> my<00:03:14.790> hole<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.270> be<00:03:15.390> nice

now this is where the magic happens
typically<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.730> would<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.270> tap<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.660> put

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
typically you would take the tap and put

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.660 
typically you would take the tap and put
it<00:03:31.930> into<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> special<00:03:32.410> tap<00:03:33.130> wrench<00:03:33.430> it's

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
it into a special tap wrench it's

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.760 
it into a special tap wrench it's
basically<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.150> tea<00:03:34.660> handled<00:03:35.230> wrench<00:03:35.590> that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
basically a tea handled wrench that

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.830 
basically a tea handled wrench that
gives<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.070> lots<00:03:36.280> of<00:03:36.460> leverage<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.660> can

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
gives you lots of leverage and you can

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.570 
gives you lots of leverage and you can
twist<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.350> guy<00:03:38.530> down<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:39.130> slowly<00:03:39.370> but

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
twist this guy down and slowly but

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.760 
twist this guy down and slowly but
surely<00:03:39.610> cut<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.660> threads<00:03:40.960> but<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:41.680> we

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
surely cut the threads but I think we

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.200 
surely cut the threads but I think we
can<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.010> better<00:03:42.160> than<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.430> if<00:03:42.730> we<00:03:42.880> take<00:03:43.030> our

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
can do better than that if we take our

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.560 
can do better than that if we take our
time<00:03:43.390> we<00:03:43.900> can<00:03:44.080> use<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.680> power<00:03:45.190> drill<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.210> get

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
time we can use a power drill and get

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.480 
time we can use a power drill and get
this<00:03:46.720> done<00:03:46.930> with<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> quite<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.770> bit<00:03:47.950> less<00:03:48.130> elbow

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
this done with a quite a bit less elbow

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.830 
this done with a quite a bit less elbow
grease<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.420> I'm<00:03:49.480> just<00:03:49.600> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> very

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
grease so I'm just going to very

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.190 
grease so I'm just going to very
carefully<00:03:50.590> place<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.190> tapered<00:03:51.610> tip<00:03:52.170> into<00:03:53.170> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
carefully place the tapered tip into the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.020 
carefully place the tapered tip into the
hole<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:54.070> very<00:03:54.340> slowly<00:03:54.810> start<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:56.020> turn<00:03:57.030> let

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
hole and very slowly start to turn let

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.340 
hole and very slowly start to turn let
the<00:03:58.150> threads<00:03:58.420> do<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.720> cutting<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.200> don't

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
the threads do the cutting you don't

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.830 
the threads do the cutting you don't
really<00:03:59.470> have<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.740> push<00:03:59.920> down<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:01.420> could<00:04:01.570> speed

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
really have to push down you could speed

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.530 
really have to push down you could speed
up<00:04:01.870> once<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.350> get<00:04:02.440> started<00:04:03.450> obviously<00:04:04.450> you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
up once you get started obviously you

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.100 
up once you get started obviously you
want<00:04:04.720> your<00:04:04.840> drill<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.380> its<00:04:05.740> slowest<00:04:06.130> setting

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
want your drill on its slowest setting

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.210 
want your drill on its slowest setting
once<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.230> get<00:04:08.380> going

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.470 

pick<00:04:12.730> up<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.940> speed<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.210> little<00:04:13.330> bit

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.370 

all<00:04:20.480> right<00:04:20.630> we're<00:04:20.780> pretty<00:04:20.959> much<00:04:21.110> at<00:04:21.290> the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
all right we're pretty much at the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.110 
all right we're pretty much at the
capacity<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.250> tap<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.460> now<00:04:22.820> we<00:04:22.880> can

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
capacity of the tap so now we can

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.930 
capacity of the tap so now we can
reverse<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.630> direction<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.370> slowly<00:04:25.370> pull<00:04:25.910> it

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
reverse the direction and slowly pull it

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.460 
reverse the direction and slowly pull it
out<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:28.360> can't<00:04:29.360> go<00:04:29.510> too<00:04:29.570> fast<00:04:29.930> here<00:04:30.200> if<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.350> go

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
out I can't go too fast here if you go

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.380 
out I can't go too fast here if you go
too<00:04:30.530> fast<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.190> will<00:04:31.280> strip<00:04:31.730> everything<00:04:32.120> out

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
too fast you will strip everything out

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.900 
too fast you will strip everything out
and<00:04:32.660> just<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.140> nice<00:04:33.350> hole<00:04:33.920> what<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.730> don't

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
and just have a nice hole what you don't

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.940 
and just have a nice hole what you don't
want<00:04:35.120> right<00:04:36.110> you're<00:04:36.230> backing<00:04:36.470> out<00:04:36.710> these

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
want right you're backing out these

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.800 
want right you're backing out these
threads<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.520> if<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:37.820> were<00:04:37.940> backing<00:04:38.240> out<00:04:38.600> an

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
threads is if you were backing out an

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:50.040 
threads is if you were backing out an
actual<00:04:39.590> bolt

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:05:03.540 

there<00:04:51.050> we<00:04:51.139> go<00:04:51.260> let's<00:04:52.130> give<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.460> shot<00:04:52.490> now

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.950 

just<00:05:04.550> as<00:05:04.669> an<00:05:04.790> example<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.330> just<00:05:05.360> took<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.720> scrap

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
just as an example I just took a scrap

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.390 
just as an example I just took a scrap
piece<00:05:06.169> of<00:05:06.199> wood<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.740> put<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.979> hole<00:05:07.190> in<00:05:07.310> it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
piece of wood and put a hole in it

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.670 
piece of wood and put a hole in it
that's<00:05:07.490> big<00:05:07.699> enough<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.060> take<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.419> bolt

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
that's big enough to take the bolt

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.080 
that's big enough to take the bolt
without<00:05:09.680> catching<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.639> will<00:05:10.790> sort<00:05:11.000> of

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
without catching and this will sort of

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.210 
without catching and this will sort of
serve<00:05:11.510> as<00:05:11.690> our<00:05:11.810> example<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.470> something<00:05:13.040> you

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
serve as our example of something you

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.350 
serve as our example of something you
might<00:05:13.250> want<00:05:13.639> to<00:05:13.699> connect<00:05:14.060> when<00:05:14.240> you're

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
might want to connect when you're

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.540 
might want to connect when you're
putting<00:05:14.990> two<00:05:15.110> pieces<00:05:15.320> together<00:05:15.680> kind<00:05:16.430> of<00:05:16.460> like

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
putting two pieces together kind of like

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.030 
putting two pieces together kind of like
our<00:05:16.820> roller<00:05:17.060> brackets<00:05:17.510> for<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:18.040> workbench

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
our roller brackets for the workbench

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.010 
our roller brackets for the workbench
and<00:05:19.790> once<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.090> get<00:05:20.180> down<00:05:20.389> to<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.660> bottom<00:05:20.810> of

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
and once you get down to the bottom of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.840 
and once you get down to the bottom of
the<00:05:21.110> hole<00:05:21.290> and<00:05:21.530> your<00:05:21.650> bolt<00:05:22.130> starts<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.669> make

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
the hole and your bolt starts to make

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.940 
the hole and your bolt starts to make
contact<00:05:23.330> with<00:05:23.389> your<00:05:23.570> washers<00:05:23.990> you're<00:05:24.830> going

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
contact with your washers you're going

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.320 
contact with your washers you're going
to<00:05:25.010> find<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.370> thing<00:05:25.550> getting<00:05:25.760> real<00:05:26.060> tight

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
to find this thing getting real tight

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.490 
to find this thing getting real tight
real<00:05:26.660> fast<00:05:29.500> all<00:05:30.500> right<00:05:31.510> that<00:05:32.510> is<00:05:32.900> going

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
real fast all right that is going

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.950 
real fast all right that is going
nowhere<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.610> check<00:05:34.790> it<00:05:34.910> out<00:05:35.060> just<00:05:35.419> one<00:05:35.660> bolt

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
nowhere so check it out just one bolt

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.590 
nowhere so check it out just one bolt
these<00:05:36.350> two<00:05:36.590> pieces<00:05:36.800> are<00:05:37.010> together<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:38.000> this

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
these two pieces are together and this

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.750 
these two pieces are together and this
is<00:05:38.660> no<00:05:38.960> joke<00:05:39.229> these<00:05:39.440> things<00:05:39.710> are<00:05:39.919> really<00:05:40.250> tight

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
is no joke these things are really tight

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.930 
is no joke these things are really tight
I<00:05:41.050> can't<00:05:42.050> even<00:05:42.169> move<00:05:42.410> them<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.860> again<00:05:43.610> one

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
I can't even move them and again one

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.360 
I can't even move them and again one
bolt<00:05:44.240> so<00:05:44.419> imagine<00:05:44.810> if<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.020> had<00:05:45.229> multiples<00:05:46.130> you

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
bolt so imagine if you had multiples you

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.430 
bolt so imagine if you had multiples you
would<00:05:46.550> have<00:05:46.639> an<00:05:46.760> incredibly<00:05:47.270> secure<00:05:47.840> fit<00:05:48.169> and

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
would have an incredibly secure fit and

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.680 
would have an incredibly secure fit and
you<00:05:49.160> would<00:05:49.280> be<00:05:49.400> able<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.610> loosen<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.330> move

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
you would be able to loosen it and move

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.930 
you would be able to loosen it and move
this<00:05:50.870> piece<00:05:51.139> if<00:05:51.380> you<00:05:51.440> needed<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:51.940> incredible

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
this piece if you needed to incredible

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.300 
this piece if you needed to incredible
possibilities<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:54.260> course<00:05:54.560> one<00:05:54.740> alternative

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
possibilities of course one alternative

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.040 
possibilities of course one alternative
here<00:05:55.520> would<00:05:55.729> be<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:55.940> use<00:05:56.120> threaded<00:05:56.570> inserts

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
here would be to use threaded inserts

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.050 
here would be to use threaded inserts
and<00:05:57.260> I've<00:05:57.350> used<00:05:57.560> them<00:05:57.740> in<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.979> past<00:05:58.010> too<00:05:58.550> the

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
and I've used them in the past too the

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.060 
and I've used them in the past too the
problem<00:05:59.419> is<00:05:59.570> they<00:05:59.720> tend<00:05:59.990> to<00:06:00.080> come<00:06:00.470> loose<00:06:00.800> and

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
problem is they tend to come loose and

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.620 
problem is they tend to come loose and
knot<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.520> threads<00:06:01.820> themselves<00:06:02.360> because<00:06:02.510> the

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
knot the threads themselves because the

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.510 
knot the threads themselves because the
threads<00:06:02.930> themselves<00:06:03.320> are<00:06:03.440> made<00:06:03.590> of<00:06:03.740> metal<00:06:04.039> you

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
threads themselves are made of metal you

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.370 
threads themselves are made of metal you
basically<00:06:04.910> drill<00:06:05.150> a<00:06:05.180> hole<00:06:05.450> and<00:06:05.660> drive<00:06:06.229> the

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
basically drill a hole and drive the

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.050 
basically drill a hole and drive the
threaded<00:06:06.650> insert<00:06:06.919> into<00:06:07.099> the<00:06:07.310> wood<00:06:07.460> it's<00:06:07.700> the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
threaded insert into the wood it's the

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.360 
threaded insert into the wood it's the
method<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.960> insert<00:06:09.320> is<00:06:09.470> attached<00:06:09.979> to

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
method that the insert is attached to

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.159 
method that the insert is attached to
the<00:06:10.460> wood<00:06:10.610> that<00:06:11.120> tends<00:06:11.360> to<00:06:11.450> come<00:06:11.539> loose<00:06:11.930> over

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
the wood that tends to come loose over

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.870 
the wood that tends to come loose over
time<00:06:12.320> so<00:06:13.010> I<00:06:13.039> don't<00:06:13.190> really<00:06:13.250> think<00:06:13.400> those<00:06:13.669> are

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
time so I don't really think those are

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.240 
time so I don't really think those are
the<00:06:13.910> best<00:06:14.000> solution<00:06:14.870> either<00:06:15.050> I<00:06:15.289> think<00:06:15.410> now

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
the best solution either I think now

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.770 
the best solution either I think now
that<00:06:16.430> I<00:06:16.460> know<00:06:16.550> about<00:06:16.849> this<00:06:17.030> method<00:06:17.270> I<00:06:17.570> think

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
that I know about this method I think

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.540 
that I know about this method I think
I'm<00:06:17.840> going<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.050> use<00:06:18.169> this<00:06:18.320> a<00:06:18.380> lot<00:06:18.710> on<00:06:18.919> jigs<00:06:19.460> and

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
I'm going to use this a lot on jigs and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.730 
I'm going to use this a lot on jigs and
fixtures<00:06:19.639> in<00:06:20.210> any<00:06:20.419> project<00:06:21.020> that<00:06:21.139> I<00:06:21.169> have<00:06:21.500> a

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
fixtures in any project that I have a

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.500 
fixtures in any project that I have a
part<00:06:22.310> that<00:06:22.490> needs<00:06:22.760> to<00:06:22.880> be<00:06:22.910> loosened<00:06:23.419> and

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
part that needs to be loosened and

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.120 
part that needs to be loosened and
tightened<00:06:24.080> again<00:06:24.289> and<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.740> want<00:06:24.919> to<00:06:24.979> make<00:06:25.099> sure

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
tightened again and I want to make sure

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.490 
tightened again and I want to make sure
that<00:06:25.430> it<00:06:25.520> lasts<00:06:25.820> for<00:06:26.030> a<00:06:26.060> good<00:06:26.240> long<00:06:26.450> time

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
that it lasts for a good long time

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.180 
that it lasts for a good long time
here's<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.620> other<00:06:27.740> thing<00:06:27.950> that's<00:06:28.039> great

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
here's the other thing that's great

about<00:06:28.280> this<00:06:28.490> these<00:06:28.849> taps<00:06:29.180> are<00:06:29.419> very<00:06:29.960> cheap

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
about this these taps are very cheap

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.260 
about this these taps are very cheap
only<00:06:30.500> a<00:06:30.650> couple<00:06:31.039> bucks<00:06:31.220> apiece<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:31.940> they're

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
only a couple bucks apiece and they're

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.580 
only a couple bucks apiece and they're
going<00:06:32.389> to<00:06:32.450> last<00:06:32.599> forever<00:06:32.900> because<00:06:33.349> you're<00:06:33.470> not

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
going to last forever because you're not

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.740 
going to last forever because you're not
drilling<00:06:34.010> into<00:06:34.370> metal<00:06:34.760> you're<00:06:35.180> just<00:06:35.539> tapping

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
drilling into metal you're just tapping

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.839 
drilling into metal you're just tapping

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
wood so you should have no problem with

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.330 
wood so you should have no problem with
these<00:06:37.970> taps<00:06:38.270> lasting<00:06:38.900> for<00:06:39.380> decades

these taps lasting for decades

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.830 
these taps lasting for decades
you<00:06:40.610> know<00:06:40.729> you<00:06:40.940> probably<00:06:41.090> pass<00:06:41.389> them<00:06:41.599> on<00:06:41.690> to

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
you know you probably pass them on to

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.080 
you know you probably pass them on to
the<00:06:41.930> next<00:06:42.110> generation<00:06:42.710> so<00:06:42.979> spend<00:06:43.820> a<00:06:43.910> few<00:06:44.030> bucks

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
the next generation so spend a few bucks

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.089 
the next generation so spend a few bucks
get<00:06:44.539> a<00:06:44.570> couple<00:06:44.870> taps<00:06:45.050> let<00:06:45.680> me<00:06:45.740> know<00:06:45.860> what<00:06:46.010> you

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
get a couple taps let me know what you

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.110 
get a couple taps let me know what you
think<00:06:46.220> if<00:06:46.400> you<00:06:46.430> include<00:06:46.789> them<00:06:46.970> in<00:06:47.090> your

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
think if you include them in your

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.909 
think if you include them in your
projects<00:06:47.660> I'd<00:06:48.050> like<00:06:48.229> to<00:06:48.349> thank<00:06:48.560> benchcrafted

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
this entire technique I would have never

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.909 
this entire technique I would have never
thought<00:06:52.940> of<00:06:53.150> doing<00:06:53.419> this<00:06:53.690> in<00:06:53.870> wood<00:06:54.349> projects

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
thought of doing this in wood projects

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.170 
thought of doing this in wood projects
