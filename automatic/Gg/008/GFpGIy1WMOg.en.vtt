him<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> centre-back<00:02:18.060> actually<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.599> see

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
him as a centre-back actually if you see

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.920 
him as a centre-back actually if you see
the<00:02:18.900> stats<00:02:19.230> um<00:02:20.120> he<00:02:21.120> could<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> blame<00:02:21.720> as<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the stats um he could you blame as a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.839 
the stats um he could you blame as a
centre-back<00:02:22.379> easily<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> fantastic

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
centre-back easily but is a fantastic

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.880 
centre-back easily but is a fantastic
send<00:02:24.300> defensive<00:02:24.780> mid<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.170> think<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.739> better

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
send defensive mid I think it's better

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.220 
send defensive mid I think it's better
than<00:02:26.069> Jack<00:02:26.250> Wilshere<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.080> have

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
than Jack Wilshere and you have to have

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.140 
than Jack Wilshere and you have to have
him<00:02:28.379> in<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.590> open<00:02:28.860> powered<00:02:29.190> BTR<00:02:29.610> squad<00:02:29.910> he's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
him in an open powered BTR squad he's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.199 
him in an open powered BTR squad he's
just<00:02:30.330> he's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> must<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.799> in<00:02:32.519> your<00:02:32.580> squad<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
just he's a must in a in your squad is

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.580 
just he's a must in a in your squad is
doing<00:02:33.330> very<00:02:33.450> well<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:33.989> every<00:02:34.170> time<00:02:34.319> as<00:02:34.410> well

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
doing very well for every time as well

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.770 
doing very well for every time as well
and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.310> its<00:02:35.549> pace<00:02:35.760> seems<00:02:36.239> more<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and I think its pace seems more in the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.070 
and I think its pace seems more in the
game<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.799> FIFA<00:02:38.519> done<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.690> move

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
game but FIFA done it like that so move

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.430 
game but FIFA done it like that so move
to<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> left<00:02:40.590> mid<00:02:40.860> we've<00:02:41.040> got<00:02:41.190> nany<00:02:42.049> now<00:02:43.049> as

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
to the left mid we've got nany now as

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.229 
to the left mid we've got nany now as
you<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:43.650> after<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.010> market<00:02:44.340> crash<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.910> might

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
you know after the market crash I might

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.080 
you know after the market crash I might
do<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> video<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.670> everyone's<00:02:47.670> price<00:02:47.940> has

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
do a video on that everyone's price has

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.420 
do a video on that everyone's price has
gone<00:02:48.120> down<00:02:48.329> I<00:02:48.510> got<00:02:48.780> nanny<00:02:48.989> for<00:02:49.200> about<00:02:49.430> 29,000

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
gone down I got nanny for about 29,000

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.839 
gone down I got nanny for about 29,000
he<00:02:50.519> used<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:50.970> 42<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.900> think<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.610> as<00:02:53.610> you

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
he used to be like 42 I think and as you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.940 
he used to be like 42 I think and as you
see<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.299> stats<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.810> absolutely<00:02:55.260> amazing<00:02:55.319> I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
see the stats are absolutely amazing I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.680

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
went with him over bail because he's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.569 
went with him over bail because he's
cheaper<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.799> don't<00:02:59.129> think<00:02:59.340> there's<00:02:59.459> much

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
cheaper and I don't think there's much

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.550 
cheaper and I don't think there's much
difference<00:02:59.819> between<00:03:00.239> them<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:01.170> could<00:03:01.349> get

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
difference between them you could get

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.750 
difference between them you could get
asked<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.890> young<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.489> didn't<00:03:02.700> have

even see this the touchdown was

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.250 
even see this the touchdown was
brilliant<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.690> furnish<00:03:43.049> was

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
brilliant and that furnish was

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.400 
brilliant and that furnish was
absolutely<00:03:43.709> insane<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.900> normally

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
absolutely insane just just normally

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.800 
absolutely insane just just normally
what<00:03:46.590> he<00:03:46.680> does<00:03:46.889> anyway<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.549> game<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.540> moving

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
what he does anyway in game so moving

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.839 
what he does anyway in game so moving
into<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.260> cam<00:03:49.560> we<00:03:49.739> got<00:03:49.919> adulterer<00:03:50.370> out<00:03:50.579> I

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
into the cam we got adulterer out I

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.559 
into the cam we got adulterer out I
think<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.299> most<00:03:51.450> overpowered<00:03:53.030> person<00:03:54.030> in<00:03:54.329> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
think the most overpowered person in the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.770 
think the most overpowered person in the
Premier<00:03:55.019> League<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:56.090> his<00:03:57.090> he's<00:03:57.419> got<00:03:57.569> good
