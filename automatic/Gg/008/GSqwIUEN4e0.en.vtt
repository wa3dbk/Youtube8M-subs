00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 today in amounts per thousand we are in the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.820
 green circuit moya with a very guest 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.350
 special it's about one of the pilots 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
 referents in what is enduro 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.359
 national extreme is mission fails the yes or 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.940
 how are we on good morning 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.630
 we are related 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.020
 but well animated as how did this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.330
 your idea of ​​doing extreme enduro 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.590
 nothing I saw that good first of all 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.810
 I started doing a lot of tutorials 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 years later I went to the enduro and inside 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.110
 of enduro the truth yes where I 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.900
 I enjoyed being doing trialeras 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.100
 doing stones doing what to the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.650
 most of them are not andres 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.900
 I liked it because that's where I enjoyed not 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.830
 nothing after I saw that at level 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.260
 international 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.170
 in these four or five races then of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 more renowned as are the Roman exvice 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.269
 see where where what was to be done 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.790
 Well, what I liked was not trialeras 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.339
 Stones difficult steps and nothing through 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.960
 of the videos watching and so you look 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.300
 I started around here not dedicating myself to this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 as a hobby at the beginning and at the level 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.200
 semiprofessional now to heaven and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.120
 currently what is is curious because 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 Of course this is coming central 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.920
 the gomez brake will be graham jarvis is 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 now william ping have to pass 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 the trianeros kiwis 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
 the truth is that this discipline of 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.840
 Enduro is fun 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.390
 and I do not know, I think the trial level 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.969
 little much where is this going? 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.649
 have it as an amateur or as 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.689
 professional but you have to have it because 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.750
 the truth that the races maybe are 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.640
 more difficult techniques and then neither 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.479
 The advantage of the trial is that at least 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.470
 difficult steps do not get tired so much what 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.630
 plans you have for next year 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.460
 then once it is recovered then in 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.960
 beginning then try again to do it 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 of this year 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 if I can then the races are more 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.170
 great to try to do all or the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.840
 that they can and now we can be 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.920
 among the top ten that I think this 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.750
 It is that this year has been like the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.119
 Extreme racing is run 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.909
 there was everything but a large majority 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.959
 when it has not been an eye stone has 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:15.829
 been a wrist injury that is 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.980
 a disaster on the subject of aids like how 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.250
 You get to run a World Cup 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.140
 I am putting my pocket quite this 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.360
 it has to be said 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.770
 because I work, I have my job thanks to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.590
 she can truthfully run 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.180
 because if it would not be impossible for me 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.380
 after the sponsors so stay in 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.150
 Spain and that helps me with the subject of 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.599
 motorcycles spare parts and it is a great help 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 to revel an energy drink as there 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.519
 different brands do not go with the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
 oil then to the links with the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.939
 pills I have a main sponsor 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.220
 also very important that is the would give 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.900
 petrol that is an agent that without spirit of 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.819
 profit also the truth is that they help me 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 and I'm doing very well on the subject of travel 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.380
 displacements 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.060
 good little help that then the deceased 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.700
 They also help you to be able to move 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.260
 because what it costs today is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.890
 move the movement of the motorcycle 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.390
 how you attract her as she is everything 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.610
 expensive 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.170
 this year you are going to lose unfortunately 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.090
 a test that is done here 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.310
 of moya that is the extreme sister 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.140
 tell us a little about this test if the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.209
 truth is that the career that had more 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.610
 illusion of the year because here is here at 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.560
 side of my house that I have it good I am 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.810
 one of those who has helped mark the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.350
 I think it will be a great 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.440
 career 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.050
 come to run side to enjoy the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.910
 landscape or to see it they will like it 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.000
 because the landscape the environment is very 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.390
 nice the race itself will be hard not 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.330
 difficult but if it lasts physically and nothing 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.470
 not hurting I could be here because 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.650
 I think it will be a great event and at 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.350
 national or territorial as the only 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
 Be the center of Catalonia at a national level 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.930
 I think this year will be the second 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.910
 extreme that is done with the pilots 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.290
 that we have here good there are only two 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.240
 careers 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.760
 this also people do not know what you think 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.590
 the why because it's not normal but 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.120
 good other countries with this we have passed 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.880
 a little ahead as Romania they have 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.320
 extreme national championship yes yes to 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.480
 those on the other side of the camera 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.090
 watching now the program 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.410
 and they are enduro fans surely 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.720
 more than one will be thinking of me 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.120
 like to run an enduro test 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.740
 extreme really is so difficult that 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.240
 would advise enduro affiliates 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.040
 who are seeing you now that they want 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.600
 run for nothing they are and see that 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.400
 come, it's very rewarding 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.590
 sweat what they have never sweated 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.510
 surely it will not be dangerous we have 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.660
 tried the steps the difficult steps 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.370
 so adapt them so that what you have 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.890
 back is not the difficulty but that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.340
 be a little bit because the fatigue is not 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.540
 can exhaustion not the difficulty in 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.760
 yes of what can be a step 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.950
 impossible that people do not what 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.000
 about is getting tired and sweating 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.750
 Enjoy the nature of the environment and 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.340
 and everything to finish the month already 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.440
 you started in trial now you're in enduro 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.060
 extreme you have considered making a jump 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.890
 to some other specialty of the two 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.590
 wheels you want to stay in new truth 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.970
 and the other to behave a bit all good 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.310
 part of the speed no but I made 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.290
 also extensive on real bicycle without 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.060
 smaller and not the truth if this 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.980
 discipline of meeting very comfortable in 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.740
 she enjoyed and good therefore today in 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.210
 day is to enjoy because if you do not enjoy 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.850
 it is not good for people to do less 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.820
 of me imposition is not more important 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.530
 for me it is to enjoy me I spend more hours 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.500
 that nobody works at work is a 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.080
 way to disconnect also but it has 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.570
 consulted of the fans yes as a 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.370
 amateur more as this is mercy of 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.990
 asia one of our props in the 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.169
 extreme national enduro we want 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.500
 lots of luck from motorcycles per thousand 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.500
 thank you
