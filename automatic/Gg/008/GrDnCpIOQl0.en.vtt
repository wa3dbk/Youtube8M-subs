00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
means that maybe like the nintendo

Nintendo characters maybe some

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
Nintendo characters maybe some
third-party<00:00:39.710> exclusive<00:00:40.710> Nintendo

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
and stuff appearing as racers in this
game<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.680> can't<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.610> Nintendo<00:00:47.820> doing

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
game I can't really see Nintendo doing

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
game I can't really see Nintendo doing
that<00:00:48.539> allowing<00:00:49.140> sumo<00:00:50.129> digital's<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.700> what<00:00:50.879> not

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that allowing sumo digital's or what not

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.939 
that allowing sumo digital's or what not
allowing<00:00:51.690> them<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.170> character<00:00:52.770> but

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
allowing them to use that character but

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.060 
allowing them to use that character but
nevertheless<00:00:53.270> maybe<00:00:54.270> there'll<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.600> some

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
nevertheless maybe there'll be some

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
nevertheless maybe there'll be some
exclusive<00:00:56.090> Nintendo<00:00:57.090> characters<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.140> maybe

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
exclusive Nintendo characters that maybe

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
exclusive Nintendo characters that maybe
are<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.800> third-party<00:00:59.399> characters<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.180> we'll

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
are like third-party characters so we'll

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.869 
are like third-party characters so we'll
just<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.660> wait<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.980> what<00:01:01.980> rosters

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just have to wait and see what rosters

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.020 
just have to wait and see what rosters
there<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> Wii<00:01:04.379> U<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.799> 3ds<00:01:05.189> versions

so<00:01:08.520> next<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> try<00:01:10.110> sent<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
so next up is that to try sent out a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.429 
so next up is that to try sent out a
tweet<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.310> says<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.260> like

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
tweet that says that they have some like

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.070 
tweet that says that they have some like
Nintendo<00:01:13.979> related<00:01:14.580> stuff<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.180> show<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.780> in

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
Nintendo related stuff to show off in

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.649 
Nintendo related stuff to show off in
the<00:01:16.409> next<00:01:16.740> few<00:01:16.979> weeks<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:18.060> guessing<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the next few weeks so I'm guessing this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.170 
the next few weeks so I'm guessing this
is<00:01:18.810> has<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.340> toki<00:01:20.729> tori<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
is has to do with like the toki tori to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.960 
is has to do with like the toki tori to
and<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.220> function<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and probably how it will function on the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
and probably how it will function on the
wheel<00:01:24.150> maybe<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> game<00:01:25.380> paddle<00:01:25.830> will<00:01:25.950> be

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
wheel maybe how the game paddle will be

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
wheel maybe how the game paddle will be
used<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> stuff<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.240> maybe<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
used and stuff like that maybe how the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.840 
used and stuff like that maybe how the
game<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> played<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.369> we'll<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
game is played so we'll just have to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.240 
game is played so we'll just have to
wait<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:31.140> two<00:01:31.380> tribes<00:01:31.710> comes<00:01:32.040> up

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
wait and see what two tribes comes up

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.609 
wait and see what two tribes comes up
with<00:01:32.490> probably<00:01:33.329> toki<00:01:33.600> tori<00:01:33.810> too<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.470> we'll

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
with probably toki tori too but we'll

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
with probably toki tori too but we'll
just<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.009> wait<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.450> next<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840

brothers on 3s and the Nintendo Wii U
and<00:02:19.770> he<00:02:19.920> said<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.850> really<00:02:21.030> isn't<00:02:21.330> much

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and he said that there really isn't much

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.300 
and he said that there really isn't much
to<00:02:21.630> worry<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:21.960> with<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.620> Namco<00:02:22.950> Bandai

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
to worry about with like Namco Bandai

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.370 
to worry about with like Namco Bandai
entering<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.940> development<00:02:24.480> process<00:02:24.570> since

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
entering the development process since

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.070 
entering the development process since
Masahiro<00:02:25.980> Sakurai<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.820> still<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.450> charge<00:02:27.480> of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
Masahiro Sakurai is still in charge of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.290 
Masahiro Sakurai is still in charge of
the<00:02:28.260> game<00:02:28.530> design<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.880> guess<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.150> means

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the game design so I guess that means

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.180 
the game design so I guess that means
that<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.840> Namco<00:02:31.140> Bandai<00:02:31.470> comes<00:02:31.710> up<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.100> an

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
that if Namco Bandai comes up with an

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.250 
that if Namco Bandai comes up with an
idea<00:02:32.280> for<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.820> game<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.600> still<00:02:33.840> has<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.140> go

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
idea for the game it still has to go

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.320 
idea for the game it still has to go
through<00:02:34.470> Sakurai<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.280> him<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
through Sakurai for him to like it and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.150 
through Sakurai for him to like it and
like<00:02:36.480> confirm<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.230> allow<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
like confirm it to allow it to be in the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.190 
like confirm it to allow it to be in the
game<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> guess<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.480> means<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:40.050> there

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
game so I guess that means that there

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.870 
game so I guess that means that there
really<00:02:40.350> isn't<00:02:40.710> much<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:41.070> worry<00:02:41.370> about<00:02:41.490> with

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
really isn't much to worry about with

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400 
really isn't much to worry about with
nan<00:02:42.090> kabann<00:02:42.510> die<00:02:42.780> entering<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
nan kabann die entering in the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.020 
nan kabann die entering in the
development<00:02:43.950> process<00:02:43.980> they're<00:02:44.490> just<00:02:44.700> helping

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
development process they're just helping

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.420 
development process they're just helping
them<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.600> help<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.080> get<00:02:46.440> by<00:02:46.620> quicker<00:02:47.070> so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
them to help it like get by quicker so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.130 
them to help it like get by quicker so
they<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.700> push<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.330> game<00:02:48.510> faster<00:02:48.990> and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
they can push out this game faster and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.690 
they can push out this game faster and
stuff<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.620> think<00:02:49.740> nevertheless

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
stuff like that I think nevertheless

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
stuff like that I think nevertheless
there<00:02:51.000> isn't<00:02:51.210> much<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.480> worry<00:02:51.720> about<00:02:51.810> since<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
there isn't much to worry about since I

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.860 
there isn't much to worry about since I
think<00:02:53.010> muscle<00:02:53.250> yo<00:02:53.460> Sakurai's<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.330> still<00:02:54.660> has

on<00:03:18.510> modern<00:03:19.050> characters<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:21.270> could<00:03:21.780> be

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
on modern characters so this could be

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.840 
on modern characters so this could be
just<00:03:21.989> completely<00:03:22.320> bogus<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.520> may<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.670> an

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
just completely bogus but it may be an

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.090 
just completely bogus but it may be an
idea<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.450> guys<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.840> could<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.709> an<00:03:25.800> idea

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
idea that you guys like could be an idea

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.460 
idea that you guys like could be an idea
that<00:03:26.400> Sakura<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.000> throwing<00:03:27.540> around<00:03:27.600> but

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that Sakura is throwing around but

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.410 
that Sakura is throwing around but
nevertheless<00:03:28.770> this<00:03:29.400> could<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:29.820> completely

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
nevertheless this could be completely

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.680 
nevertheless this could be completely
bogus<00:03:30.690> because<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:32.010> don't<00:03:32.550> know<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.270> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
bogus because I don't know if like the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.880 
bogus because I don't know if like the
development<00:03:33.989> team<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.560> stuff<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:34.830> that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
development team and stuff like that

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.500 
development team and stuff like that
would<00:03:35.190> come<00:03:35.400> up<00:03:35.520> with<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> name<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.270> game

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
would come up with a name for the game

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.110 
would come up with a name for the game
so<00:03:36.780> fast<00:03:37.140> it's<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.250> start<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.550> development

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
so fast it's just start a development

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.610 
so fast it's just start a development
and<00:03:39.209> stuff<00:03:39.390> like<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.959> think<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> name

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
and stuff like that I think the name

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
and stuff like that I think the name
process<00:03:41.100> comes<00:03:41.340> down<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.850> line<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
process comes down in a line so this

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.660 
process comes down in a line so this
could<00:03:43.080> be<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.260> completely<00:03:43.560> bogus<00:03:44.100> stuff<00:03:44.489> but

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
could be just completely bogus stuff but

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.400 
could be just completely bogus stuff but
nevertheless<00:03:44.880> loads<00:03:45.690> out<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.959> wait<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.290> see

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
nevertheless loads out the wait and see

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.020 
nevertheless loads out the wait and see
the<00:03:46.860> last<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.670> little<00:03:47.820> bit

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the last up is just a little bit
