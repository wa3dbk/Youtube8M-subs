00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 How about super'm nicholas fishman 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 pixel today we are going to make the comparison 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.750
 fast between the engine or the motorcycle and the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.750
 motor or motorcycle gp 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.600
 here we have the engine on the left and 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.800
 on the right to the engine of the motorcycle gp and 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.150
 that less than the difference in size is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.939
 a little appreciable are noticed more than 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.099
 nothing in what is the vertical dimension 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.869
 that is, the motorcycle is a little bit higher 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.630
 gp that is however the phones are 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 quite comfortable light and can be 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.340
 handle quietly with one hand 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.570
 the design is basically the same in the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.890
 two let's notice that on the right side 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.420
 we have the power buttons 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.829
 those of volume up and 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.050
 down on the left side 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.430
 there's nothing else so let's go to the part 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.380
 below where we have in both 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.629
 also the microusb connector to pass 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.239
 data from or to the pc and above 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.620
 also the 3.5 mm jack for 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.179
 for listening to music with headphones or 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.500
 speakers and also the microphone of 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.149
 cancellation of sounds let's see that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.429
 basically it's the same design as the 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.160
 ex motorbike we do not have many differences 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.929
 more than anything what you notice at first 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.640
 view is the subject of the speaker speaker 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.130
 that we have here below in the front 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.050
 engine and also that in the engine if 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.180
 we have front camera when in the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.890
 no engine and then also one thing 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.200
 important in the engine that we have flash 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.750
 led and camera with autofocus but in the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.850
 engine not what we do have luckily in 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.100
 the engine is the expansion by micro 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.260
 that up to 32 GB that we do not have the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.180
 same touch 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.170
 if we see the screens we are going to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.420
 find that we both have 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.600
 ips panels only here we have a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.770
 resolution 540 pp and in this 720 p and what 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.630
 I do have to tell you to simple 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 sight is quite noticeable that the brightness of the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.110
 engine that is a little bit bigger than the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 engine will have to be seen later on later 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.350
 in the sun how the engines behave 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.030
 remember that the full analysis 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.160
 they will find in the channel later 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 even so the two panels have colors 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.910
 quite vivid look very well 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 Vision angles are very respectable 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.020
 especially for devices of this 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.790
 range both with the engine and the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.380
 average in the engine and the sharpness also 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.240
 it's very good so let's be able to read 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.680
 text easily condoned browsing 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.710
 online or by reading facebook what 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.540
 be 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.409
 seeing the operating system by luck 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.030
 the motorola has a policy 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.180
 very strong updates so 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.800
 we found 4.4 KitKat items 4 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.450
 they are still not seeing it because they do not 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.370
 that says this phone but if it arrives 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.720
 up to 4 points 4.4 this I tell you 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.580
 because I'm sure low in the comments I 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.250
 they will say it and also masters in this 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.650
 4.4 points kitkat case in the engine that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.290
 It will also be upgradeable to 4.4 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.910
 points 4 kitkat later but these 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.160
 much later it was talked about going to 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.930
 android be the final version or 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.730
 we do not know what it will be called for so much 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.230
 ex motorcycle like him and him 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.090
 but we see that here the operating system 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.230
 it works perfectly fluid in both 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.060
 phones so there's no 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.709
 commitment in what is the trivia and the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.940
 general functioning of the system does not 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.590
 only on the desk but in the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.480
 application drawer and also 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 navigation in general so they would be 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.959
 for example the system options well 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.560
 that in that sense the truth that is 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.390
 barbarous both the motogp and the engine 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.610
 not let them waste much time I 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.349
 skip the navigation and keyboard theme 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.810
 because basically we saw this in the 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.430
 own video engine and it's also in 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.750
 the analysis of the motogp that you can see 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.280
 also of course we leave the link 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.720
 down in the description let's talk 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.610
 directly from the camera where we see 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.319
 that the interface is basically the same 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.569
 in both the only difference 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.709
 important that we have autofocus in the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.930
 engine and in the engine 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.310
 not where we can only control the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.959
 exhibition so let's see what it is 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.350
 so fast take the picture let's do 1 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.030
 2. 3 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.800
 basically at the same time so not 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.780
 there is a lot of difference in regards 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.610
 on time of course the quality of 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.420
 image will vary quite a lot between 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.850
 motorcycle moto gp 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.800
 however none of the two cameras have 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.050
 an image quality not just photos 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.220
 but in video let's say very high so 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.080
 if what you are looking for is purely a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.680
 phone to take pictures look towards 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.359
 other side 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.400
 talking very quickly about games without 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.090
 Show on either one 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.989
 in this case I feel like so much in the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.069
 video that we made the first 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.599
 engine impressions 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.909
 as of course in the analysis of 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.920
 moto gp we saw how the games work 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.750
 so refer to those videos to see 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.799
 how it works in general what does them 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.659
 I have to say is that the experience of 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.340
 games is good in both we are not going to 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.599
 power manda left the universe heavier 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.280
 with the graphics to the maximum but 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.079
 quietly an angry candy craft 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.340
 birds or some game a little heavier 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.700
 those we will be able to play without 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.650
 problems 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.940
 finally what is connectivity I the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.260
 I really do not think that the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.180
 calls that I would have read it for 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.950
 course in some other review in the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.419
 motor the bike that we already know that the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.150
 call works perfectly well as well 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.769
 let's talk directly about the battery 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.940
 as we saw in the analysis a while ago 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.190
 the engine battery held a 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.540
 montonazo we arrived easily to the day and 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.590
 as I said also in the first 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.110
 engine impressions 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.760
 I also believe fervently that 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.229
 The world's battery must last all day 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.260
 easily by the combination of 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.330
 hardware that has 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.340
 so remember more than anything I think that 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.280
 the most important difference is that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.950
 The focus of the motor camera is fixed 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.630
 compared to the autofocus of the 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.100
 motor and we also have led flash that 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.630
 for many people it is important and 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.880
 also that we have a front camera 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.470
 as the most important difference so 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.120
 you have to be clear about these two things 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.350
 that I mentioned if they seem very 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.970
 important everything is undoubtedly 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.560
 we have to go yes or yes for the motorcycle gp 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.850
 but we can calmly go for the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.280
 motorcycle that is a phone that we say 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.920
 the truth comes out in the middle almost of what 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.850
 that the moto gp comes out so now this 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.870
 that you are already low in 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.910
 comments which of the two is 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.910
 would buy which ones seem better and why 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.809
