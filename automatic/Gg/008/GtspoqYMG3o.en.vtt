 meter 60 countries looks very good 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:23.360
 I also have to say that looks like that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.880
 the keyboard gets out, these are the four 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.450

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.299
 a bit relieved and relaxed 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.430
 and otherwise a normal keyboard 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.650
 German layout of course, there are synonymous 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.540
 at roy keyboard costs about 50 euros 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:11.609

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:14.310
 description and so the two stands 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.859
 indoors with Derdiyok and tackle can 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.239
 we are powerful and I would say 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.609
 decide the good piece a professional 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.010
 and have a look at the most different ones 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.970
 driver 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.870
 makes motorvision the overall impression 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.329
 as well as a keyboard now 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.299
 connected and we also see here 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.370
 in front the blue leds over the 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.840
 volume and if we now the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.230
 like to let keyboard light up 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.230
 Let's talk about the LED button 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.640
 or now we would have the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.810
 drive a variety of rainbow 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.700

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.040
 do not hurt others 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.040
 Of course, there are still red ones 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:29.590
 white pink or purple blue light blue or 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:29.590
 turn in green-yellow in red and selek one 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:40.120
 hand washes the pad and said does 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:49.759
 actually a very stable impression 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:50.560
 processing plastic yes that will only 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.220
