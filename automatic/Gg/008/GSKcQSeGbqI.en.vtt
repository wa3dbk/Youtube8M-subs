 work with those who were approximately 14 years of age 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.150
 in our favor is very important 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.059
 and we have characteristics very similar to other releases and 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.489

 Can I use a product? 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.429
 means from an understanding of the human being 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.999
 the real sex 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.179
 and he starts working 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.550
 the product when you begin to understand 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.419
 who is to be prepared 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.580
 who goes 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.580
 really relate to him 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.450
 a product and led tvs all its functional features 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 the benefits it can bring in someone's life 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.240
 everything he means from the emotional point of view I'm very 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.140
 excited that he is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.320
 We can not run a car. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 and say what it should mean in people's lives 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.979
 without understanding 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.840
 people everything starts to go 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.410
 I started to understand this bid. 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.960
 some people are 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.350
 and the meaning of life 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.440
 this feeling 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 if what people live everyday will see how it is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.550
 it will fit 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.110
 these advices 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.049
 buy a car had limited 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.950
 It's very explosive birthday mind to bring me 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.430
 I was going to compare until employees did not have to face the big 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.820
 small helmsman truck in family the amount of these on account of 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.840
 distance from the time of day 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.929
 how much do I need to disseminate a type of motorization 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.040
 and it is not in fact these people do 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.620
 I think until his old time somehow severe 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.210
 when the subject is unlikely 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.360
 What is not true today we do not have much more what they are 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.000
 and many more things by that name 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.340
 and people started looking at the cards and they started to have a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.450
 meaning that related to what I feel 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.270
 with what I think what I wanted to say about the person I am 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.000
 or about last instance person that I want the site 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.410
 and positioning the car has to do with it with understanding who the people are 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.410
 understand that it's a car he knows 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.909
 several aspects involved 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.109
 the same way as the other nodes or france months 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.419
 the fiat arrived for us with the product was developed with sugar 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.719
 I was already released 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.849
 if we traveled 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.109
 what are called productive chains air 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.959
 this exercise is easy not you have some things that need to be done 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.660
 How are we going to discuss it? 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.709
 the release 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.879
 if we look 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.549
 everything that was done in all the countries where the film was released at the very 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.929
 what were the market characteristics 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.409
 the characteristics of the consumers in each 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.650
 later we immerse ourselves in Brazil in what was being done by the museum van gogh 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.620
 fifth car ie the kikito the segment that car belongs to 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.319
 industry segment next year b 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.359
 the version segments of Brazilian luxury cars are Brazilian citizens 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.650
 So we'll try to understand 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.689
 click here segment both from the market point of view 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.010
 with communication service, this work began in mortality 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.269
 because we went a lot with the crisis until the turkey 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.729
 practice this the launching of the car 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.469
 in the first version of the car there 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.469
 together with the Brazilian journalists of the sector 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.460
 even more that we are already starting to analyze 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.740
 how did the car of the family was to talk that hypothesis like it 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.209
 Could you do it if you work in Brazil? 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.109
 following this 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.109
 Bring the car so it can be searched from Brazil. 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.530
 the 5th race is the one of all this emotion said marina in its most 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.380
 in a detailed way 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.049
 what is initially talking about product fisheries 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.809
 eric ipt 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.759
 philips intelligence that is led by the fantin 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.900
 since father 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.930
 do a search 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.969
 in deepening bringing a car 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.689
 and putting the car to be compared with other cars that are leaving 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.049
 make success in life 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.230
 At that moment we have a set of results that analyze 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.989
 and that already begins to be used in the development of the car is for us 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.469
 know why it has changed in the world and certain characteristics 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.139
 all these things that people 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.509
 moreover the product whether we like it or not 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.719
 people 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.070
 and then I understood 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.070
 why certain things work in turkey 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.379
 the character had 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.270
 further ahead we develop a job sat forced to identify 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.259
 on sites 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.389
 today it is our goal is 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.340
 understand 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.950
 how do people have the sony can not is a very car that mixes 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.510
 a temporary excuse for and cruel in an extremely balanced and 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.499
 car design 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:49.349
 inspired a lot of technology consumers was something that we 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.939
 we cover in research this is a car that is going to have to talk about us but what 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.529
 and that is 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.019
 fitch do not use the same way here other brands for river this is a 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.860
 which has to be taken into account 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.860
 because the brands without getting different 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.889
 the phrase an extremely young brand 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.819
 only in amateur 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.090
 what is expected of the fiesp honda fiat pall from the south 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.120
 heart attacks and in a more 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.160
 in a more 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.290
 the expected course of an innovative young brand with fiat is a museum 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.860
 austere 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.630
