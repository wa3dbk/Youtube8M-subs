hey guys for some in this video on hold
why<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.929> Nexus<00:00:04.470> 5<00:00:04.650> sucks<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.400> Android<00:00:05.879> 4.4.3

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
why the Nexus 5 sucks on Android 4.4.3

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.459 
why the Nexus 5 sucks on Android 4.4.3
so<00:00:07.649> first<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.610> all<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.599> main<00:00:09.780> reason<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.440> that

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
so first of all the main reason is that

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.509 
so first of all the main reason is that
there's<00:00:11.070> nothing<00:00:11.670> much<00:00:12.059> changed<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.380> NR<00:00:13.679> 4<00:00:13.889> 4.3

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
there's nothing much changed in NR 4 4.3

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.990 
there's nothing much changed in NR 4 4.3
so<00:00:15.269> that's<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.230> big<00:00:16.500> reason<00:00:16.529> why<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.430> sucks

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
so that's the big reason why it sucks

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.730 
so that's the big reason why it sucks
and<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.600> other<00:00:18.779> reason<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.380> I've

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and the other reason is that I've

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.830 
and the other reason is that I've
installed<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.390> during
