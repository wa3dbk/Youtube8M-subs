keen<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.780> race<00:01:46.020> trend<00:01:46.979> by<00:01:47.100> Harry<00:01:47.310> fry

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
keen on in this race trend by Harry fry

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
keen on in this race trend by Harry fry
he<00:01:48.060> he<00:01:48.990> missed<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> triumph<00:01:49.619> last<00:01:49.799> year<00:01:50.009> well

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.050 
he he missed the triumph last year well
I<00:01:50.189> think<00:01:50.250> he<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.640> been<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> leading

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
I think he would have been a leading

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.810 
I think he would have been a leading
fancy<00:01:51.570> i<00:01:51.600> went<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> liverpool<00:01:52.439> instead<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
big horse is always going to be better

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
big horse is always going to be better
as<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> five-year-old<00:01:56.310> than<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> four<00:01:56.850> year<00:01:57.000> old

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.900 
he runs here even offer higher mart than
it<00:03:24.080> these<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.410> Ireland<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:24.950> think<00:03:25.550> he's<00:03:25.700> got<00:03:25.850> a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
it these in Ireland I think he's got a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.000 
it these in Ireland I think he's got a
lot<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.180> upside<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.840> he'd<00:03:27.440> be<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.680> my<00:03:27.770> short

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
lot of upside and he'd be on my short

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.380 
lot of upside and he'd be on my short
list<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.340> ran<00:03:28.490> here<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.090> way<00:03:29.209> around

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
list of you ran here and the way around

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.850 
list of you ran here and the way around
i<00:03:29.660> know<00:03:29.720> he<00:03:29.930> fell<00:03:30.170> last<00:03:30.350> time<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.740> red

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
i know he fell last time in the red

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.470 
i know he fell last time in the red
mills<00:03:31.070> but<00:03:31.190> he<00:03:31.250> was<00:03:31.370> traveling<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:31.970> well<00:03:32.209> as

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
mills but he was traveling so well as

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480 
mills but he was traveling so well as
the<00:03:32.870> way<00:03:32.990> to<00:03:33.050> travel<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.740> whole<00:03:33.860> race<00:03:34.100> and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
the way to travel to the whole race and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.610 
the way to travel to the whole race and
I<00:03:34.790> think<00:03:35.360> hitting<00:03:35.570> rock<00:03:35.810> isn't<00:03:36.170> without<00:03:36.440> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
I think hitting rock isn't without a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.680 
I think hitting rock isn't without a
chance<00:03:36.950> in<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.220> champion<00:03:37.610> hurdle<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.030> he<00:03:38.540> was

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
chance in the champion hurdle and he was

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.840 
chance in the champion hurdle and he was
upsides<00:03:39.050> him<00:03:39.290> arguably<00:03:40.160> traveling<00:03:40.670> maybe

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
upsides him arguably traveling maybe

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.270 
upsides him arguably traveling maybe
even<00:03:41.090> better<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.810> out<00:03:41.989> when<00:03:42.709> he<00:03:42.800> fell<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.130> that

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
even better to out when he fell on that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.110 
even better to out when he fell on that
occasion<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.840> basile<00:03:45.700> yeah<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.850> rendering

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
occasion so a basile yeah the rendering

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.550 
occasion so a basile yeah the rendering
the<00:03:47.180> world<00:03:47.330> hurdle<00:03:47.480> it'd<00:03:47.750> be<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.900> sneaky

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
the world hurdle it'd be a sneaky

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.140 
the world hurdle it'd be a sneaky
outside<00:03:49.010> even<00:03:49.280> though<00:03:49.340> five-year-olds<00:03:50.060> have

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
outside even though five-year-olds have

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.820 
outside even though five-year-olds have
got<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.270> bad<00:03:50.480> record<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.110> race<00:03:51.230> low<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.650> is

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
got a bad record in the race low this is

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.490 
got a bad record in the race low this is
a<00:03:51.860> moderate<00:03:52.250> world<00:03:52.430> hurdle<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:52.910> I'd<00:03:53.600> like<00:03:54.350> to

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
a moderate world hurdle but I'd like to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.350

pipe<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:14.540> i<00:04:14.750> think<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.320> owner<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.800> I've<00:04:16.130> got<00:04:16.160> a

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
pipe but i think the owner is I've got a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.250 
pipe but i think the owner is I've got a
couple<00:04:16.669> of<00:04:16.820> others<00:04:17.060> very<00:04:17.570> interesting<00:04:18.109> for

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
couple of others very interesting for

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.520 
couple of others very interesting for
that<00:04:18.380> race<00:04:18.560> kawada<00:04:18.950> Frank<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:20.289> McKinley<00:04:21.289> so

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that race kawada Frank and McKinley so

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.440 
that race kawada Frank and McKinley so
is<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.770> chance<00:04:22.130> i<00:04:22.370> think<00:04:22.550> on<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.729> two<00:04:22.910> could<00:04:23.210> run

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
is a chance i think on the two could run

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.310 
is a chance i think on the two could run
here<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.320> rated<00:04:24.560> 104

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
only five now when you consider that

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.600 
only five now when you consider that
