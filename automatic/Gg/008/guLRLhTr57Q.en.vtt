00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.509 
there's a lot of players right next to
them<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.750> yeah<00:02:54.959> multiplayer<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.980> will<00:02:56.190> display

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
them so yeah multiplayer it will display

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.920 
them so yeah multiplayer it will display
the<00:02:56.670> name<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.030> if<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.269> don't<00:02:57.450> want<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> names

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the name but if you don't want the names

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.810 
the name but if you don't want the names
to<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.170> displayed<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:59.220> go<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.610> radar

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
to be displayed you go to the radar

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.160 
to be displayed you go to the radar
settings<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.540> could<00:03:00.690> turn<00:03:00.810> off<00:03:01.019> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
settings and you could turn off the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.120 
settings and you could turn off the
names<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.980> will<00:03:02.040> only<00:03:02.280> show<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> players

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
names so it will only show the players

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.530 
names so it will only show the players
but<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.640> best<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.120> keep<00:03:06.330> what

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
but I think it's just best to keep what

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.970 
but I think it's just best to keep what
the<00:03:06.630> names<00:03:06.840> because<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.830> looks

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the names because I think it looks

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.110 
the names because I think it looks
cooler<00:03:08.250> with<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.489> name<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> top<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
cooler with the name the top of the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120 
cooler with the name the top of the
heads<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> radar<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.709> notice<00:03:11.010> i
