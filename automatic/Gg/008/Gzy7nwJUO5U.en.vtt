 let's friends with you petrovsky tv we 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.980
 at the 2014 Paris Motor Show this 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.570
 company market stand and today we 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 let's talk about the serial version 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 rhino electric car Zoe 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 Reno company is one of the few 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.160
 manufacturers in the world for which 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.430
 bright electric future is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 already essentially everyday present today 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 in the model range 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 This automaker has already 4 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.440
 similar machines fluence 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.910
 grids and kangu z and this is electric 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.550
 versions of production models 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.130
 baby twizy it's likely even 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.380
 motorcycle double they are car and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 this one is absolutely full and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.080
 standalone electrical project 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 hatchback 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 renault for and maybe that's why such 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.180
 universal and popular electric car 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.590
 is of interest to senior 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.229
 Persons like here on the stand 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.289
 President of the group Renault nissan Carlos 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.930
 rut personally held a presentation zoe for 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.300
 french president francois holland 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.090
 following the two presidents access 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.700
 the car received and our film crew in 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 what is the main advantage of the main 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.090
 chip this car 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 the fact is that this is one of the few 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.380
 electric cars in the world that are already 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 sold and which anyone can buy 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 willing 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.119
 Of course you can argue and remember 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 tesla model s 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.790
 but just do not forget what it costs 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.399
 from about 60-70 thousand dollars and above 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.130
 while the zoo base in 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.100
 Europe can be bought for 16 thousand euros 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.440
 It is for the price for and may well 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.040
 compete with classmates with 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.780
 conventional gasoline or diesel engine 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.060
 European in choosing a new car 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.820
 may already seriously think and not 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 Does he go on electric since 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.380
 all other parameters 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.450
 operation of such a machine is practically not 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.769
 different from the operation of ordinary 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.190
 urban hatchback 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.320
 here is the electric motor 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.630
 outstanding power equivalent to 88 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.420
 horsepower and accelerate such 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.760
 the machine can up to 135 kilometers per hour 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.940
 it is powered by a powerful engine 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.519
 liteon oh batteries at 22 kilowatt-hours and 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.480
 manufacturer guarantees average mileage 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.690
 from full 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.819
 order to one hundred and fifty kilometers at 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.230
 moderate air temperature from plus 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.090
 ten degrees and up 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.670
 if this machine is operated at 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.650
 negative temperatures then mileage 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.560
 is about 100 kilometers from 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.140
 one charge is quite good tell me 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.810
 you since any diesel hatchback with 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.579
 similar dimensions passing from 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.280
 five to six times the full tank 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.790
 however, it has long been noticed that 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.640
 average user 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.579
 similar hatchback drive for a day in 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.560
 an average of 30 50 kilometers which means that 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.870
 no hassle with everyday 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.269
 operating such a machine does not deliver 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.970
 well, except for charging the shooting range 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.040
 refueling will need to think every night 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.410
 for this the machine can connect to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.120
 conventional power grid and recruit full 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.670
 charge four to ten hours 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.769
 for example at night while you sleep 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.450
 there are two more accelerated modes 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.269
 charging with special chargers 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.299
 stations one of them charges in an hour 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.849
 80 percent battery and the fastest 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.799
 does the same thing in 30 minutes while 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.959
 the cost of one kilometer run 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.329
 electric car at times less 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.989
 than diesel or gasoline 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.760
 fellow 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.829
 even considering the high price of 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.870
 electricity in europe what are 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.669
 fundamental difference in operation 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.840
 Here's an electric hatchback 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.799
 against and active 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.349
 ibiza 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.870
 well firstly as a bonus you always 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:24.120
 get like an automatic box 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.370
 gears and only two pedals 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.680
 center same attention for the driver on 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.550
 dashboard will not speedometer or 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.490
 tachometer 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.050
 a residual charge indicator 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.909
 battery and discharge indication 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.229
 here is not a percentage like 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.539
 for example on a smartphone 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.490
 and in real kilometers and 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.590
 pretty seriously depends on the style 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.539
 your driving course if you 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.400
 prefer all the time to be first and 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.680
 dynamically start crossroads 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.530
 and perhaps 100 kilometers on a single 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.319
 charging me to drive this fat well 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.669
 based on behavior 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.860
 average driver if 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.560
 curb your own temperament 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.319
 it's hard enough for you to click on 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.900
 eco button and then the car itself 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.870
 dispense pressing the gas pedal 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.940
 as well as the owner of the national electric vehicle from 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.259
 quite spacious back sofa and 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.389
 trunk capacity of 388 liters as the same wound 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.849
 managed to offer this car for 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.190
 pretty humane money thing is that 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.860
 European buyer acquiring himself 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.659
 the car gets the battery like in 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.880
 installment for 3 years 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.430
 monthly fee for this battery 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.819
 is 49 euros easy to count 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.979
 that in three years it turns out 1800 euros 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.110
 the truth is that you get full 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.789
 battery warranty in principle can not 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.430
 pay but then this one 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.620
 expensive car item to take off 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.870
 with a guarantee that's so simple and elegant 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.539
 ubiquitous incentive course 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.990
 go to electric traction up 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.990
 dating
