00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.349 
you're going to have to get it from both
sides<00:02:11.609> because<00:02:11.790> you're<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.060> gonna<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.299> able

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.359 
sides because you're not gonna be able

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.050 
sides because you're not gonna be able
to<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.570> all<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> way<00:02:12.810> through<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.790> we're

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
to go all the way through so that we're

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.750 
to go all the way through so that we're
hitting<00:02:15.359> the<00:02:15.480> pins<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:17.040> now<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.640> could

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
hitting the pins there so now we could

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.710 
hitting the pins there so now we could
try<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.299> peel<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.780> off<00:02:19.109> and<00:02:19.410> see<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.799> got

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
try and peel it off and see what we got

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
try and peel it off and see what we got
and<00:02:21.720> there<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.109> go<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.310> case<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.670> can

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
and there we go and in this case you can

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.199 
and there we go and in this case you can
see<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> left<00:02:24.329> all<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.829> glue<00:02:25.829> on<00:02:26.010> there<00:02:26.220> it's

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
see it left all the glue on there it's

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.780 
see it left all the glue on there it's
not<00:02:27.359> a<00:02:27.390> big<00:02:27.570> deal<00:02:27.750> we'll<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:28.459> peel<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.730> off

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
not a big deal we'll just peel that off

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.030 
not a big deal we'll just peel that off
as<00:02:30.180> well<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.959> might<00:02:34.200> take<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> few<00:02:34.590> minutes

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
as well this might take a few minutes

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.970 
as well this might take a few minutes
but<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.450> bad

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.949 

alright<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> finally<00:02:41.489> got<00:02:41.820> all<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.299> residue

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
alright so I finally got all the residue

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.349 
alright so I finally got all the residue
off<00:02:42.989> there<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.680> tried<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.730> hair<00:02:45.060> dry<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.269> little

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
off there I tried the hair dry a little

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.030 
off there I tried the hair dry a little
more<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> heat<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:45.989> up<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.230> peel<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.530> off<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
more to heat it up and peel it off and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.729 
more to heat it up and peel it off and
then<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> actually<00:02:47.340> revert<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.440> using<00:02:49.440> some

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
then I actually revert it to using some

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.340 
then I actually revert it to using some
good<00:02:50.010> old<00:02:50.160> goo<00:02:51.060> gone<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.810> letting<00:02:52.079> us<00:02:52.170> sit

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
good old goo gone and letting us sit

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.130 
good old goo gone and letting us sit
there<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.859> came<00:02:52.980> off<00:02:53.130> pretty<00:02:53.370> easily

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
there and then it came off pretty easily

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.360 
there and then it came off pretty easily
some<00:02:55.140> people<00:02:55.380> don't<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> use<00:02:55.829> Google<00:02:56.040> on

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
some people don't like to use Google on

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.650 
some people don't like to use Google on
paint<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.790> I've<00:02:56.880> never<00:02:57.000> had<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> problem<00:02:57.450> with

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
paint but I've never had a problem with

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.630 
paint but I've never had a problem with
it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.309 
it
a<00:02:58.670> couple<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.240> scratches<00:02:59.480> there<00:02:59.810> too<00:03:00.020> when<00:03:00.230> I

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
a couple of scratches there too when I

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.510 
a couple of scratches there too when I
was<00:03:00.350> putting<00:03:00.650> uh<00:03:00.770> but<00:03:00.950> that's<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.220> big<00:03:01.370> deal

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
was putting uh but that's not a big deal

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.309 
was putting uh but that's not a big deal
since<00:03:01.730> we're<00:03:01.880> covered<00:03:02.120> them<00:03:02.240> up<00:03:02.330> all<00:03:03.020> right<00:03:03.140> so

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
since we're covered them up all right so

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.820 
since we're covered them up all right so
now<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:04.069> new<00:03:04.450> emblem<00:03:05.450> has<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.720> peel<00:03:06.290> off<00:03:06.560> the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
now the new emblem has a peel off the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.930 
now the new emblem has a peel off the
layer<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:11.090> get<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.300> grip<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.940> right

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
layer here we get a grip on that right

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.430 
layer here we get a grip on that right
part<00:03:14.240> of<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.569> could<00:03:14.660> start<00:03:14.900> peeling<00:03:15.110> off

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:39.080 

taking<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.620> pieces<00:03:22.550> off<00:03:22.700> itself

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.280 

all<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.420> now<00:03:40.599> we<00:03:40.659> want<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.019> be<00:03:41.109> careful

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
all right so now we want to be careful

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.050 
all right so now we want to be careful
make<00:03:41.799> sure<00:03:41.950> we<00:03:42.129> get<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.430> right<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.730> first<00:03:42.909> time

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
make sure we get it right the first time

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.990 
make sure we get it right the first time
because<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:44.500> not<00:03:44.709> too<00:03:44.950> easy<00:03:45.159> to<00:03:45.370> move<00:03:45.609> if<00:03:45.849> you

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
because it's not too easy to move if you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.740 
because it's not too easy to move if you
mess<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.299> up<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:47.730> line<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.939> up<00:03:49.030> with<00:03:49.209> my<00:03:49.269> tape

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
mess it up so line it up with my tape

it looks pretty good matches the new
wheels<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:11.150> it<00:05:11.210> looks<00:05:11.390> like<00:05:11.450> its<00:05:11.690> factory<00:05:12.020> so
