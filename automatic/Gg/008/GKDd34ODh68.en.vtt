00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.860
 Italian exclusive signed g point scene 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 pt or the unboxing of the first 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.949
 smartphone tagore lame or the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.310
 lame zp 998 the phone that mounts the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.330
 chipset mediatek oktagon memo nt 65 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.010
 92 of 1.7 gigahertz of grock 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.660
 we thank his noble point it for 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.580
 sending the symbol and we see the unboxing 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
 waiting for the full review 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.910
 will be published in the coming weeks 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.950
 the box of the lame zp 998 is that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 classic game we are now 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.789
 accustomed simi inside the box 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.500
 let's go and see obviously we find the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:55.850
 phone we're going to see in a while 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.850
 user manual after under the tray 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.019
 micro usb cable and standard earphones 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:18.990
 the 2,400 milan battery for now is the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:24.240
 charger well but let's see now the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.170
 phone in more detail are excellent 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.979
 already the first impressions and let's go to ad 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:38.310
 open lacquer and cover to insert the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 battery and we immediately see the two 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:47.009
 slots for the sim and a slot for the micro 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.189
 sd of expansion as lamb lies mx 69 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 pro also the back cover of the lame zp 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.820
 998 is made of plastic but with a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.909
 leather look effect on the back cover e 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.439
 moreover we also find the nfc chip e 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.479
 the adoption of this chip is perhaps one 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.149
 of the main new features after 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.720
 regarding his first smartphone 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.000
 8 cores we insert the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.760
 cover and we come to the back where 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.720
 we find a 14 megapixel camera 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.840
 with f 2.0 aperture and one led flash 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.490
 camera that promises to give the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.990
 possibility of making excellent ones 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.480
 photographs but we'll see it from 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.580
 review and both be the camera 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.830
 with flash LEDs are surrounded by a 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.000
 chrome frame that besides giving a nice 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.190
 effect from the aesthetic point of view 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.470
 certainly also serves as a protection 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.590
 for the room and for the flash LED note 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.140
 at the bottom instead we have a speaker of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.600
 system a double speaker system e 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.900
 looking instead at the front 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.380
 remove first film we see that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:58.310
 the dimensions of the lame zp 998 are 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:02.690
 251 4 mm 76.1 for 9.1 mm thickness for 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.560
 a total battery weight of 168 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.560
 g 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.800
 we turn on the phone and see that the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.390
 power button is placed on the side 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.280
 left together with a shutter button 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.769
 of the camera an additional option 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.970
 of later that will surely make you happy 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.500
 those who are more 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.360
 passionate about photography so that 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.110
 it will be possible to shoot without 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.350
 change the volume keys display 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.030
 positioned on the right side jack for i 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.580
 three and a half inch earphones 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.420
 positioned on the upper edge 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.200
 high while in the lower part we find 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.940
 micro usb input of positioned in 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.640
 low on the left side 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.209
 here we see that in the frontal part 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.100
 of the phone we find the 5 camera 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.530
 there was an interruption in the apps 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.660
 google play so we don't start in the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.070
 better than we used to say 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.250
 in the front we find one 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.310
 5 megapixel camera flanked by 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.830
 two light and proximity sensors e 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.090
 in 5.5 inch display with 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.599
 full hd thousand resolution 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.000
 20 x 1080 with gorilla protection 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.950
 glass is wrapped in frames that are 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.530
 really very thin and therefore 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.479
 facilitates the grip of the device 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.850
 despite we say the size 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.350
 sustained and allow a discreet one 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.900
 use with one hand of course 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.330
 it does not seem possible precisely to execute 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.370
 all transactions with a sum but 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.090
 all in all possible a handle 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.880
 quite easy at the bottom we find the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.060
 30 st teta is silenced backlit 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.680
 this time well backlit a 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.080
 difference for example of what we have seen 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.620
 initially with the lame zp 980 in which 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.740
 these keys were light like this 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.430
 they fall to make them almost invisible ed 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.350
 the sharpness of the display is excellent 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.850
 the first also appears excellent 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.480
 contact the quality of materials 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.860
 constructive but obviously also in 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.920
 this case it is right to wait a few 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.040
 day of trial before being able to express 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.660
 however an overall judgment also 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.870
 if I must say that these first ones anyway 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.490
 impressions are really very positive 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.050
 we said then okafor processor 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.320
 mediateche puts the 65 92 from 1.7 gb of 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.000
 clock flanked by 2gb of ram and 16gb of 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.530
 internal memory 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.100
 also in this case as already mentioned for 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.530
 ngn the ice mx 69 I try this chipset 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.830
 if on the one hand it seems to digest in a manner 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.950
 easy full hd resolution is indeed 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.360
 you will notice the fluidity of the touch e 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.420
 you will notice that it is no longer there anyway 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.200
 the delay effect in the passage from dro e 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:51.010
 application to wins everything 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.460
 quite fast 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.190
 on the other hand obviously on the other side 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.590
 obviously asks if the battery and 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.090
 device battery seal e 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.630
 especially the zoo battery ed 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.750
 just 100 98 with its only 2,400 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.490
 milan for now may be a little 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.200
 narrow for a phone with these 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.050
 characteristics but also this 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.950
 obviously we will see in the review 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:21.850
 on the zp 998 game and installed android 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.340
 jelly bean 4.2.2 as an interface 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.400
 completely personalized from the house 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.480
 as you can see directly with i 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.480
 your eyes 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:40.680
 the interface is customized in all 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.640
 I have to be honest about the various screens 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.140
 looking at videos where it came from 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.970
 shown this moment and faces of 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.970
 lame I was not enthusiastic about the 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.090
 same to see it live instead is a lot 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.610
 different in when it seems to me well 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.410
 realized a demerit note but it goes 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.750
 definitely nitrogen just for how much 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.720
 regards this beautiful interface 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.310
 of originality of the icons these 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.280
 use these that you see in fact 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.930
 are the icons of the os lever 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.940
 but still a detail indifferent in 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.100
 how much the overall result is a lot 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.620
 good closing 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:17.380
 thank you again after mobile point 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.410
 it for kindly sending us 0 0 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.300
 ap 998 oktagon and file the review 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.770
 complete that will be published in 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.220
 next weeks 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.220
 thank you
