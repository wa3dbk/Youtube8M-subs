00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 all alone welcome to the review 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 of the scan so it's the scan that came out this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.610
 morning at 654 here is a scan 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.520
 a bit odd honestly they were 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.050
 short and strange and last week 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.359
 if I remember well the road to both 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.820
 time from the month to hospitals so there 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 I started this frame while waiting 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 at this early I saw hospitals so put 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 a small slot to him and Naruto 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.170
 catch the throat which I told myself the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.949
 scan starts very well 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 and finally it's quickly falling back 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.010
 just because then you have 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.250
 included a rate hobby from the beginning 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.449
 and physically determined we will say 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 but mentally 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.479
 always between two chairs we see 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.710
 always think of the past regretted wine 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.140
 it's a bit weird wearing and the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.000
 determined drop and there in this scan a 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.789
 Once again we see him go back to 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.409
 see forgiveness images of the rin 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.390
 all saints alone at the time of takashi 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.030
 so 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.130
 he loses the ball completely 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.869
 squarely to the point where he even goes 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.550
 on the other hand he forgot that everyone 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.190
 is in the process of him taking her 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.179
 chakra and his beats plays at the same time 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.909
 so he does not even realize he 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.159
 is handled by the past and 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.950
 unfortunately for him everyone 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.780
 gets to pull that out of him and he gets 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.979
 found without any power 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.770
 that's what I understood from pascan 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.200
 so is this the end of the reign of mythos 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.720
 unfortunately I believe so I 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.420
 am a little disappointed a bit like I was 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.090
 disappointed with judy when he has when he's 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 pulled out of the sound bed of his body 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.400
 since 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.460
 since giuly was the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.290
 reunification will say ten jewels of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.290
 end of the nine earlier I would have thought 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.670
 so and to an immeasurable power 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.610
 and therefore to immeasurable damage 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.200
 finally when I forget it came out he has 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.360
 frankly almost nothing done 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 he really did almost nothing he killed 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.750
 two three people this is the story of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.690
 to say but he did not do any real 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.610
 carnage and obito I think I have a little this 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.020
 same feeling so s and me in the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.150
 comments if you think like me or 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.500
 not the guy is like Kudu rice 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.580
 senile so he has a power 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.470
 unbelievable 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.569
 but if you look at what he has 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.650
 does it like guys if they are 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.720
 still fighting something 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.580
 he did not kill anyone he did not do anything 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.880
 of extraordinary so I admit I have a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.640
 little trouble understanding why 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.560
 so powerful ddd perso finally do 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.590
 not much to the limit my tara he has 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.170
 do ten times better at the same time 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.330
 some scans since he put ko the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.940
 the four notebooks like that in one 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.920
 snap of fingers good so here I 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.319
 do not understand too much there I think so 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.209
 that it is the splitting of saline water 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.060
 and so obito will become again a 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.530
 obito center simply blow this 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.820
 which makes my theory tone a little to 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.829
 water with regard to precisely 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.260
 madara since I thought it was 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.020
 obito thanks to its power tell ip from 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.640
 Celine and her kind of game 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.960
 weird that can affect the aids to 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.730
 116 I thought it was him who 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.910
 was going to finish with madam finally 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.980
 and apparently obito his reign is 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.040
 finished he's lying on the floor without 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.960
 power so I really tell myself what is 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.670
 that what is going to come 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.400
 bout of madar good I admit I do not know anything 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.620
 at all on the other hand when I 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.160
 thoughtful he claimed to have managed to kill the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.350
 ricoh finally to put an end to ricoh 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.940
 scattering people so madara 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.220
 finally they are able to 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.900
 the alliance under the belfry we'll see 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.170
 what goes in the jubilation that is going to 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.640
 pass 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.560
 in any case here is the scan was pretty 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.570
 strange and in the end we understand so I 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.430
 believe that stumbles at the bottom and you and that 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.740
 is finished all these stories with 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.000
 all his plan so I do not really know what 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.500
 what's going to happen is what ultimately 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.670
 the true but what I thought 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.620
 honestly it was the real bad guy 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.140
 of history the last villain the big 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.520
 nasty but apparently not so is this 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.560
 that eventually it will be madara who 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.120
 will occupy this place 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.220
 I do not know, so here we are 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.660
 will wait for the next scan to 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.050
 know maybe a little more let me 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.300
 your opinions on the scan and if you too 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.340
 you find it yes or no that their husbands 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.050
 decades so as a ball biteau 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.520
 finally was a bit too short to 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.299
 your taste here so let me your 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.530
 I'm interested 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.330
 do not hesitate to discuss it 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.130
 between you and we meet again 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.240
 next week for the next scan 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.920
 since suddenly I really want 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.200
 to know what's going to happen and 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.090
 who will take the role of this super villain 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.770
 final so here I am really waiting to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.120
 looking forward to a good week 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.120
