 all others also box individually 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.550
 order then this box would be 19 95 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 costs 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.170
 there are also subscriptions there again 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.969
 or all year abos this then 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 be cheaper accordingly 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.079
 The value of each individual box should 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.760
 at 14 again over 40 euros 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.530
 and I'm very excited here too 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 wrapped up as nicely as we did 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.010
 expect from such a beautiful 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 pretty little drugs a little 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.170
 sticker gaga stands on it and what in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 The carton as the box also came along 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.860
 was the latest issue 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.240
 of course I am very happy about that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.770
 I'm glad I do not have them anymore 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 In the subscription I believe you two 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.189
 had subscribed for years now 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.580
 i do not buy it anymore i buy it 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.680
 I like to keep on with it 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.299
 kiosk and that just came with me 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.350
 sent with this box I am pleased 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.659
 me very much because i have nothing 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.299
 scary like the gala read me 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.920
 By the way, here is a note 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.210
 but that is not a bit where the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.070
 prices are in it but there is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.869
 on the back of it what is in it me 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 now have no idea and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.729
 then yes this is again this 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.810
 feeling inside I'm drowning first 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.759
 dispose of it better to the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.170
 products come 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 while removing the little black one 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 I already have buffer snakes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.610
 what is quasi and michael immediately 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.619
 nail polish in the hands of perin ducks 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.759
 very nice, I think very well you know 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.729
 yes what the costs in the drugstore 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.280
 usually i have the color here 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.750
 421 piece of cake and that looks like 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.219
 a beautiful apricot stone so it 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.799
 is not pink with it or something 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.969
 simply apricot wonders for beautiful 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.409
 I am looking forward to the coming spring 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.670
 to apply that I have also in the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.509
 moment no color on it maybe 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.519
 I am brush 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.900
 maybe still very appealing to me 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.379
 I am already looking forward to the nail polish 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.030
 very much 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.180
 then I have a sunscreen here 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.730
 Protection factor 30 of Tyrolean nut oil b20 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.900
 milliliters so it's a bun 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.549
 I will be able to use in the summer 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.010
 I already had clear Tyrolean nut oil 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.849
 right in a box or something and what is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.489
 the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.349
 there is no sunscreen alpine the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.170
 is a pen and i already wrote 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.730
 It's all a bit like that 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.379
 I can feel good about wearing this 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.329
 That's nice on the forehead 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.650
 or on the nose so still 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.329
 on the places where one thinks of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.650
 Run faster or on top of that 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.700
 I just apply that, I think that's great 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.379
 I will definitely take that with me 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.870
 in the next holiday tyrolean nut oil 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.810
 is a good company I know how 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.459
 I think that's not bad at all 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.139
 next i have here from the company 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.170
 the greens are also familiar with this company 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.750
 I am an organist from the glossybox 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.299
 Racing an organic ostring body 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.730
 cream in his pump dispenser around dispenser 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.870
 I always find it nice and because there 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.430
 one wonders just not the finger 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.190
 you can just press on it and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.379
 I think that is 100 percent natural 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.019
 rahlstedter extra on it so it is one 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.430
 nature what with natural cosmetics company me 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.750
 I had my clerks from it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.040
 I was very excited about having a peeling 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.959
 I did not like that so much I am 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.030
 curious how the queen is doing so 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.310
 then it's in here again by kories 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.620
 a cream and that is a 24 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.690
 hours of streisand wide cream for 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.099
 Normal normal to dry skin 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.049
 I'll just take a look inside and 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.280
 just look how that is so and so sees the 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.980
 So cream is a normal one 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.500
 very light very easy kreon leaves 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.269
 Ease of cream like me 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.769
 very easy to coach and easy 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.239
 co there is also a good company there had 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.280
 I also know something from kories 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.629
 I like to use them so I can 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.680
 even imagine me as soft as that 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.629
 now completely on my skin 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.169
 maybe even as a race night cream too 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.870
 use 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.849
 wildrose this direction is here 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.980
 I have not had that yet 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.440
 the end here is even more of stevens 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.989
 an antifa anti wrinkle lifting 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.220
 Concentrates are here so absolutely in it 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.930
 you can turn it on so had something 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.459
 I ever get that enough then always 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.870
 exactly for one application I expire 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.000
 very much in the evening before going to bed 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.220
 why not go out here I have 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.979
 anything else from a make-up company else 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.190
 roses i dont know what it is a dual 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.380
 brews a eyebrow brother watching 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.500
 I 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.400
 but it was a pity to have it 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.810
 open now it is broken it is 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.950
 unfortunately broke down with her you arrived 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.810
 can see it here it is totally 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.030
 crumbles I'll try that 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.470
 maybe it all messes up what I am 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.080
 even now I'll mess up 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.240
 try to repress it with alcohol 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.200
 because the dark color is coming anyway 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.460
 not for me 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.350
 I'll try it this way 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.480
 maybe filming have the bright 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.620
 color is probably something for me 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.780
 think that has a slight red sting 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.950
 I just have to try it like that 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.020
 For me, but first I have to 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.060
 this whole crumbled a bit 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.230
 Unfortunately I think it's a pity to save 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.700
 basically, I think his 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.260
 eyebrow point a good idea and the 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.660
 I also knew the companies Rosen 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.530
 glossybox a very nice blush of 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.160
 this company in it 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.960
 I think it's a pity that is broken and 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.630
 The last product I think is one 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.870
 nail file of kathrin or catherine 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.680
 a nail file for the times may 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.420
 try out 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.520
 which is I think the enemies side since 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.500
 here is still a coarser page here 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.500
 and for clubs 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.680
 i just enjoy but i am right 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.850
 I believe sick strictly on the kelter 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.530
 This time they are in it of his 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.140
 hands with the whole beautiful 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.180
 colors by sally hansen thomas kubicki 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.480
 totally happy that I've been 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.220
 I then looked at it but so on 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.330
 box is empty and i think it's a pity 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.830
 that eyebrow brother 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.240
 maybe you can break it 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.620
 there is still work and that is one 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.940
 maybe in such a crack foil still 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.780
 could pack or so it would be 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.490
 maybe not happening 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.320
 Now you look at cards and shows 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.690
 you the prices to the individual points 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.050
 the wildrose moisturizer by 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.820
 kories has 16 milliliters and took that 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.030
 is a special size would normally have 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.760
 she would be 40 milliliters and would be 27 eur 90 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.740
 cost the eyebrow brother of susan 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.580
 is an original product and would 19 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.010
 cost euro 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.750

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.200

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.340
 cost six euros normal 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.960
 So the wall at the beginning pretty much 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.150
 Well, I think that will last a long time 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.550
 has pretty good surface i think 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.020
 the is not going as fast as broken 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.430
 a simple one from ebeleben or solar 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.350

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.000

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.030
 by stevens is an original size 179 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.950
 that usually costs my conclusion too 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.240
 the box falls now first positive 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.790
 I like the box 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.320
 I think they are reasonably high quality 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.510
 and very appealing I think that 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.460
 mix good eyebrows true because something 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.520
 Creaming the other well is usually always 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.889
 in it in such boxes nail polish like 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.360
 I like it so much so overall 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.160
 the content of this box and I think that 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.080
 quite quite nice I have 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.030
 unfortunately now when unpacking have 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.470
 I damaged the box a bit here 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.260
 I just scratched over it but that 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.690
 I was with a pair of scissors 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.040
 big carton slipped on the box 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.550
 in itself, as I said, so too 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.750
 quite what I particularly like 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.460
 give them the latest edition of the gala 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.890
 I'm also very happy with that 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.330
 appealing I thank you 

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.070
 for watching i wish you all 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.690
 I have a nice day for everyone 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.690
 healthy and until next time bye
