further<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.359> by<00:03:14.510> rotating<00:03:14.799> so<00:03:15.799> we<00:03:15.980> could

type<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:17.269> ID<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:20.349> then<00:03:21.349> we<00:03:21.470> could<00:03:21.620> type<00:03:21.859> in

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
type in the ID and then we could type in

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.949 
type in the ID and then we could type in
the<00:03:22.280> password<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.879> get<00:03:23.239> into<00:03:23.449> this<00:03:23.720> class

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449 
an animated yellow spot that can move

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.920 
an animated yellow spot that can move
forward<00:06:55.680> to<00:06:57.150> highlight<00:06:58.150> each<00:06:58.389> of<00:06:58.629> the<00:06:58.719> points

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
forward to highlight each of the points

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.879 
forward to highlight each of the points
that<00:06:59.349> the<00:06:59.680> instructor<00:07:00.159> may<00:07:00.310> want<00:07:00.659> to<00:07:01.659> make<00:07:01.889> the

that the instructor may want to make the

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.920 
that the instructor may want to make the
slides<00:07:03.159> will<00:07:03.490> rotate<00:07:03.909> on<00:07:04.210> the<00:07:04.360> cue<00:07:04.569> I<00:07:04.599> think

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
slides will rotate on the cue I think

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.480 
slides will rotate on the cue I think
you<00:07:05.020> can<00:07:05.199> begin<00:07:05.469> to<00:07:05.499> see<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.800> spot<00:07:06.189> moving

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
you can begin to see the spot moving

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.809 
you can begin to see the spot moving
around<00:07:06.849> now<00:07:07.509> and<00:07:07.719> we'll<00:07:07.870> just<00:07:08.080> give<00:07:08.229> it<00:07:08.349> time

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 
around now and we'll just give it time

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.309 
around now and we'll just give it time
to<00:07:09.819> get<00:07:09.939> down<00:07:10.120> to<00:07:10.300> the<00:07:10.360> bottom<00:07:10.569> I<00:07:10.930> think<00:07:11.199> we're

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 
to get down to the bottom I think we're

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.740 
to get down to the bottom I think we're
going<00:07:11.439> to<00:07:11.529> emphasize<00:07:11.979> right<00:07:12.430> into<00:07:12.909> atrium<00:07:13.509> and

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
going to emphasize right into atrium and

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.959 
going to emphasize right into atrium and
right<00:07:14.080> ventricles<00:07:14.650> and<00:07:14.860> left<00:07:15.099> atrium<00:07:15.550> and<00:07:15.729> so

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:15.969 
right ventricles and left atrium and so

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.779 
right ventricles and left atrium and so
on<00:07:16.090> and<00:07:16.270> then<00:07:17.139> will<00:07:17.319> advance<00:07:17.650> to<00:07:17.830> another

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
on and then will advance to another

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.519 
on and then will advance to another
slide<00:07:19.120> this<00:07:19.990> is<00:07:20.199> done<00:07:20.439> very<00:07:20.949> simply<00:07:21.189> with

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:22.529 
slide this is done very simply with

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.990 
slide this is done very simply with
software<00:07:23.529> that<00:07:23.680> we<00:07:23.740> have<00:07:23.889> site<00:07:24.129> licenses<00:07:24.699> for

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
software that we have site licenses for

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.450 
software that we have site licenses for
the<00:07:25.270> learning<00:07:25.599> curve<00:07:25.750> is<00:07:25.960> very<00:07:26.259> short<00:07:26.650> but<00:07:26.889> the

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.460 
the learning curve is very short but the

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.189 
the learning curve is very short but the
result<00:07:27.759> is<00:07:27.909> nice<00:07:28.150> you<00:07:28.449> can<00:07:28.629> see<00:07:28.810> the<00:07:28.960> slides

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 
result is nice you can see the slides

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.800 
result is nice you can see the slides
