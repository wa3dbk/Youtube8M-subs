actually<00:01:13.500> does<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> lightens<00:01:15.600> your

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

hair is through hydrogen peroxide

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
hair is through hydrogen peroxide
that's<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.170> its<00:01:19.380> main<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> also

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that's like its main thing but it also

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.020 
that's like its main thing but it also
has<00:01:21.270> conditioning<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.880> ingredients<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
has conditioning kind of ingredients in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.420 
has conditioning kind of ingredients in
it

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
it

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.420 
it
it's<00:01:25.940> not<00:01:26.150> going<00:01:26.480> to<00:01:26.720> completely<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:27.710> your

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
it's not going to completely like your

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.090 
it's not going to completely like your
hair<00:01:28.730> after<00:01:29.240> one<00:01:29.960> use<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.770> not<00:01:30.890> going<00:01:31.040> to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
hair after one use and it's not going to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100 
hair after one use and it's not going to
make<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.310> all<00:01:31.400> brittle<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.000> stuff<00:01:32.330> well<00:01:32.960> it's

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
make it all brittle and stuff well it's

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
make it all brittle and stuff well it's
kind<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.650> more<00:01:33.920> subtle<00:01:34.250> slow<00:01:34.840> process<00:01:36.130> that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
kind of a more subtle slow process that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.890 
kind of a more subtle slow process that
keeps<00:01:37.310> your<00:01:37.580> hair<00:01:37.820> healthy<00:01:38.270> which<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:39.080> like<00:01:39.760> so

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
keeps your hair healthy which I like so

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.870 
keeps your hair healthy which I like so
the<00:01:41.900> way<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.230> works<00:01:42.290> is<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.830> spray<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.640> into

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
the way it works is you spray it into

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.230 
the way it works is you spray it into
damp<00:01:44.540> hair<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.260> then<00:01:45.860> it's<00:01:46.370> heat<00:01:46.700> activated

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
damp hair and then it's heat activated

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.850 
damp hair and then it's heat activated
so<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.600> can<00:01:47.750> either<00:01:47.870> go<00:01:48.170> out<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.560> Sun

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
so you can either go out in the Sun

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.680 
so you can either go out in the Sun
which<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.250> kind<00:01:49.550> of<00:01:49.580> what<00:01:49.820> you're<00:01:50.240> supposed<00:01:50.420> to

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
which is kind of what you're supposed to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.690 
which is kind of what you're supposed to
do<00:01:50.870> or<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.860> take<00:01:52.040> a<00:01:52.100> hairdryer<00:01:52.640> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
do or you can just take a hairdryer to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.430 
do or you can just take a hairdryer to
it<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:54.680> know<00:01:54.740> dry<00:01:55.040> our<00:01:55.220> hair<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:57.170> does

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.140 
it and you know dry our hair and it does
I<00:01:57.830> said<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:58.280> was<00:01:58.369> like<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.490> slow<00:01:58.729> process

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
I said that it was like a slow process

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.540 
I said that it was like a slow process
but<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.390> does<00:01:59.570> work<00:01:59.840> even<00:02:00.590> after<00:02:00.860> just<00:02:00.890> one<00:02:01.250> use

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
but it does work even after just one use

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.550 
but it does work even after just one use
so<00:02:01.940> after<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.390> couple<00:02:02.600> days<00:02:02.840> you'll<00:02:03.110> definitely

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
so after a couple days you'll definitely

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.580 
so after a couple days you'll definitely
see<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> difference<00:02:04.280> um<00:02:05.260> there's<00:02:06.260> this<00:02:06.410> little

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
see a difference um there's this little

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.570 
see a difference um there's this little
like<00:02:08.260> things<00:02:09.260> aren't<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:09.800> blurry<00:02:10.160> but<00:02:10.399> this

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
like things aren't it's blurry but this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.890 
like things aren't it's blurry but this
little<00:02:10.790> like<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:13.120> little<00:02:14.120> chart<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.600> guess

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
little like is it little chart I guess

gotten<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:48.050> really<00:02:48.170> mind<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.500> way

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
gotten but I don't really mind the way

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.690 
gotten but I don't really mind the way
it<00:02:48.650> looks<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.980> actually<00:02:49.100> like<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.519> way<00:02:49.550> it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
it looks I actually like the way it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.509 
it looks I actually like the way it
looks<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.709> whole<00:02:51.830> reason<00:02:52.100> I'm<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:52.340> front

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
looks so the whole reason I'm in front

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.540 
looks so the whole reason I'm in front
of<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.760> new<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.750> new<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.070> like<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
of this new not new but it's like the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.610 
of this new not new but it's like the
window<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.910> new<00:02:56.269> set<00:02:56.510> up<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:57.019> just<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.380> show<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
window a new set up is just to show you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.590 
window a new set up is just to show you

know if you could tell up here it's not

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.790 
know if you could tell up here it's not
as<00:03:05.090> light<00:03:05.390> as<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.750> was<00:03:05.900> down<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.470> because

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
as light as it was down here because

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800 
as light as it was down here because
when<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:06.950> first<00:03:07.280> started<00:03:07.640> using<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.299> wanted

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
when I first started using it I wanted

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.539 
when I first started using it I wanted
to<00:03:08.900> see<00:03:09.080> if<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.230> would<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.500> anything<00:03:09.920> at<00:03:10.040> all<00:03:10.130> so

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
to see if it would do anything at all so

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.640 
to see if it would do anything at all so
I<00:03:10.580> sprayed<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:11.360> mainly<00:03:11.600> like<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.320> bottoms

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
I sprayed it mainly like on the bottoms

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.610 
I sprayed it mainly like on the bottoms
of<00:03:12.769> my<00:03:12.920> hair<00:03:13.250> bottoms<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.360> my<00:03:14.540> hairs<00:03:14.930> or

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
of my hair bottoms of my hairs or

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.009 
of my hair bottoms of my hairs or
whatever<00:03:15.860> um<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.299> could<00:03:17.510> just<00:03:17.630> compare<00:03:17.959> it

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
whatever um so I could just compare it

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.840 
whatever um so I could just compare it
to<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.200> top<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.620> there<00:03:18.769> was<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.489> drastic

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
to the top and there was a drastic

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.000 
to the top and there was a drastic
difference<00:03:20.420> like<00:03:20.630> when<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.230> put<00:03:21.680> my<00:03:21.709> hair<00:03:21.980> up

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
difference like when I put my hair up

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.039 
difference like when I put my hair up
for<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.310> top<00:03:22.489> like<00:03:23.180> up<00:03:23.360> here<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.660> was<00:03:23.780> black

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
for the top like up here it was black

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.370 
for the top like up here it was black
and<00:03:24.320> down<00:03:24.500> here<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.769> was<00:03:24.860> like

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and down here it was like

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.940 
and down here it was like
so<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:26.010> did<00:03:26.880> do<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.180> um<00:03:27.570> I'm<00:03:28.380> not<00:03:28.530> sure<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:28.830> you

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
so I did do this um I'm not sure if you

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.000 
so I did do this um I'm not sure if you
could<00:03:29.070> tell<00:03:30.290> let's<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.680> there's<00:03:31.950> a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
could tell let's see if there's a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.590 
could tell let's see if there's a
difference<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:34.850> hopefully<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.000> tell<00:03:36.330> but

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
difference so hopefully you can tell but

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.120 
difference so hopefully you can tell but
like<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:38.220> little<00:03:38.880> chunk<00:03:39.090> right<00:03:39.330> here<00:03:39.690> is

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
like this little chunk right here is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.970 
like this little chunk right here is
lighter<00:03:41.510> than<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.200> right<00:03:43.560> here<00:03:43.800> which

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
lighter than like this right here which

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.710 
lighter than like this right here which
is<00:03:44.130> black<00:03:44.400> that's<00:03:44.790> just<00:03:44.940> because<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.270> used<00:03:45.570> it

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
is black that's just because I used it

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.430 
is black that's just because I used it
more<00:03:46.020> down<00:03:46.320> at<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> bottom<00:03:46.740> um<00:03:47.990> yeah<00:03:48.990> so<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
more down at the bottom um yeah so it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.750 
more down at the bottom um yeah so it
does<00:03:49.590> make<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.340> difference

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
does make a difference

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.030 
does make a difference
um<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:54.510> I'm<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:54.750> gonna<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.140> try<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:55.740> show

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
um so I'm just gonna like try and show
