piston facing upwards and put a crafting

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.480 
piston facing upwards and put a crafting
table<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.109> top<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.920> don't<00:00:17.039> need<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.340> use<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
table on top you don't need to use a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.800 
table on top you don't need to use a
crafting<00:00:17.820> table<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.270> that's<00:00:18.420> what<00:00:18.570> I'm<00:00:18.630> using

change them at all now put redstone dust

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.050 
change them at all now put redstone dust
on<00:00:29.070> top<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:29.429> two<00:00:29.609> blocks<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.970> I've

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
on top of these two blocks that I've

side-by-side as I do here and put a
torch<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.960> middle<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> basically

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
torch in the middle so this is basically

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
torch in the middle so this is basically
what<00:01:33.630> I've<00:01:33.840> done<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> lower<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.650> by<00:01:34.979> now

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
what I've done in the lower one by now

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
what I've done in the lower one by now
doing<00:01:35.460> higher<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> repeater

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
doing higher on now put a repeater

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
doing higher on now put a repeater
facing<00:01:37.560> outwards<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.220> either<00:01:38.340> side<00:01:38.659> again

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
facing outwards on either side again

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
facing outwards on either side again
leaving<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.409> alone<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.520> diagonally

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
leaving them alone and then diagonally

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
leaving them alone and then diagonally
upwards<00:01:42.329> place<00:01:43.079> blocks<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.979> need<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> put

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
upwards place blocks now you need to put

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
upwards place blocks now you need to put
a<00:01:44.369> torch<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.820> side<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.240> dust<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.570> top<00:01:45.780> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
a torch on the side and dust on top so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.539 
a torch on the side and dust on top so
now<00:01:46.740> you're<00:01:46.829> gonna<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.340> side

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
now you're gonna go to the other side

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
now you're gonna go to the other side
and<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.790> same<00:01:48.030> thing<00:01:48.500> diagonally<00:01:49.500> upwards

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and do the same thing diagonally upwards

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
and do the same thing diagonally upwards
torch<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> side<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.509> redstone<00:01:51.780> dust<00:01:52.049> on

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
torch on the side and redstone dust on

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.340 
torch on the side and redstone dust on
top<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.759> instead<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> putting<00:01:54.390> my<00:01:54.720> normal

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
top so now instead of putting my normal

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.569 
top so now instead of putting my normal
piston<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> torch<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.490> gonna

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
piston on top of the torch you're gonna

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.030 
piston on top of the torch you're gonna
put<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.850> underneath<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.360> torch<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.040> normal

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
put it underneath the torch so normal

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.959 
put it underneath the torch so normal
piston<00:01:59.219> underneath<00:01:59.939> facing<00:02:00.659> inwards<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> now

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
piston underneath facing inwards so now

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.190 
piston underneath facing inwards so now
what<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> need<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> need<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> put

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
what you need to do is you need to put

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
what you need to do is you need to put
glowstone<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.130> example<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.579> using

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
glowstone for this example I'm using

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.440 
glowstone for this example I'm using
glowstone

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
glowstone

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.910 
glowstone
you're<00:02:06.659> gonna<00:02:06.750> put<00:02:06.960> three<00:02:07.140> outwards<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.860> do

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
you're gonna put three outwards as I do

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
you're gonna put three outwards as I do
here<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.539> gonna<00:02:09.629> remove<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> middle

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
here then you're gonna remove the middle

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.990 
here then you're gonna remove the middle
one<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> put<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> normal<00:02:11.310> piston<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.849> gap

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
one and put a normal piston in that gap

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.750 
one and put a normal piston in that gap
facing<00:02:12.360> em<00:02:12.450> with

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
facing em with

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.479 
facing em with
now<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.390> can<00:02:13.480> remove<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.750> outer<00:02:13.989> one<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.370> now

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
now you can remove the outer one so now

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.710 
now you can remove the outer one so now
we<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.730> need<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.120> go<00:02:16.239> around<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.510> front

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
we you need to do is go around the front

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.580 
we you need to do is go around the front
and<00:02:16.840> put<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.049> button<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> middle

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and put a button in the middle

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.949 
and put a button in the middle
underneath<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.250> redstone<00:02:18.580> torch<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.090> as

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
underneath the redstone torch and as

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.449 
underneath the redstone torch and as
you'll<00:02:20.110> see<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.409> swaps<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.769> normal<00:02:21.099> block<00:02:21.280> for

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you'll see it swaps the normal block for

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.720 
you'll see it swaps the normal block for
the<00:02:21.580> glowstone<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.709> they<00:02:24.220> were<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.549> simple

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the glowstone so they were really simple

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.850 
the glowstone so they were really simple
to<00:02:24.909> make<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.299> I'm<00:02:25.420> gonna<00:02:25.599> demonstrate<00:02:25.870> lemon

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
to make and I'm gonna demonstrate lemon

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.380 
to make and I'm gonna demonstrate lemon
action<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.370> how<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.790> kind<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.030> cover<00:02:28.269> up

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
action and how you can kind of cover up

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690 
action and how you can kind of cover up
the<00:02:28.510> redstone<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.160> here<00:02:30.340> I've<00:02:30.489> got<00:02:30.519> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
the redstone so here I've got the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.660 
the redstone so here I've got the
crafting<00:02:31.060> table<00:02:31.830> see<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.920> crafting<00:02:33.549> table

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
crafting table see the crafting table

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
crafting table see the crafting table
swapped<00:02:34.030> out<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.209> another<00:02:34.540> block<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.470> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
swapped out for another block so that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.309 
swapped out for another block so that
you<00:02:35.650> can't<00:02:35.890> see<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:37.239> is<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.629> nice<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
you can't see it this is really nice to

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.900 
you can't see it this is really nice to
have<00:02:38.379> in<00:02:38.530> your<00:02:38.560> house<00:02:38.769> in<00:02:38.950> economy<00:02:39.310> safes

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
have in your house in economy safes

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.400 
have in your house in economy safes
having<00:02:40.180> space<00:02:40.420> inside<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> room<00:02:41.170> what<00:02:41.319> does

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
having space inside the room what does

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.600 
having space inside the room what does
it<00:02:41.530> takes<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.920> lot<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.069> space<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.519> rest

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
it takes up a lot of space for the rest

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.569 
it takes up a lot of space for the rest
oh<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.989> now<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.040> ceiling

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
oh so now you see it in the ceiling

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.479 
oh so now you see it in the ceiling
I've<00:02:45.790> got<00:02:46.030> lights<00:02:46.239> placed<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.349> points<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.860> and

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
I've got lights placed on points in and

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.449 
I've got lights placed on points in and
it<00:02:48.610> swaps<00:02:48.819> out<00:02:49.000> for<00:02:49.150> another<00:02:49.299> block<00:02:50.400> okay<00:02:51.400> so

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
it swaps out for another block okay so

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.949 
it swaps out for another block okay so
there's<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.970> couple<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.239> examples<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
there's just a couple of examples of

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.479 
there's just a couple of examples of
what<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.290> means<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.590> blocks<00:02:53.799> walk<00:02:54.010> before<00:02:54.160> you

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
what it means the blocks walk before you

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.160 
what it means the blocks walk before you
can<00:02:54.849> also<00:02:55.000> make<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> horizontal<00:02:55.510> pot<00:02:55.930> smoker

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
can also make a horizontal pot smoker

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.869 
can also make a horizontal pot smoker
and<00:02:56.500> if<00:02:56.829> any<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.160> guys<00:02:57.280> need<00:02:57.519> help<00:02:57.549> but<00:02:57.790> I
