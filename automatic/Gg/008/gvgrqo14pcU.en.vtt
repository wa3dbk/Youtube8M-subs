to don't touch the White House so this

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.930 
to don't touch the White House so this
is<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> minigame<00:00:07.350> based<00:00:07.649> off<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.040> cool<00:00:08.340> app<00:00:08.580> and

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
is a minigame based off the cool app and

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.839 
is a minigame based off the cool app and
where<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.019> basically<00:00:10.349> don't<00:00:11.340> touch<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
where you basically don't touch the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.370 
where you basically don't touch the
white<00:00:12.000> tile<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.509> tabs<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> black<00:00:13.170> ones

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
white tile the tabs all the black ones

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530 
white tile the tabs all the black ones
but<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> Wise<00:00:14.040> Ones<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.580> that's<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.420> it

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
but not the Wise Ones and that's how it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140 
but not the Wise Ones and that's how it
works<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.080> let's<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.160> started<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.789> think

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
works so let's get this started I think

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.260 
works so let's get this started I think
we<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:19.529> over<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.220> begin<00:00:20.580> so

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
we just go over here and we can begin so

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
we just go over here and we can begin so
this<00:00:21.480> one's<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> little<00:00:21.960> strange<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.710> use<00:00:23.010> in

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
this one's a little strange we use in

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.859 
this one's a little strange we use in
the<00:00:23.369> pearls<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.970> Interpol<00:00:24.449> back<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the pearls and we Interpol back and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.560 
the pearls and we Interpol back and
forth<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> aa<00:00:26.330> high<00:00:27.330> score<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:28.170> nice<00:00:29.510> okay<00:00:30.510> so

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
forth and aa high score one nice okay so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.720 
forth and aa high score one nice okay so
we'll<00:00:31.019> treat<00:00:31.170> give<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> another<00:00:31.710> try<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.550> we

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
we'll treat give that another try so we

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.600 
we'll treat give that another try so we
just<00:00:32.940> enter<00:00:33.270> pearl<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:34.110> each<00:00:34.370> individual<00:00:35.370> tile

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
just enter pearl to each individual tile

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400 
just enter pearl to each individual tile
and<00:00:35.850> such<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.350> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and such so I think we do it kind of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
and such so I think we do it kind of
like<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.770> very<00:00:38.370> cool<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.790> AH<00:00:39.450> three<00:00:40.170> wow<00:00:41.149> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
like this very cool and AH three wow so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
like this very cool and AH three wow so
this<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.540> uses<00:00:42.719> intervals<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.530> I'm<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.100> too

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this one uses intervals and I'm not too

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.770 
this one uses intervals and I'm not too
sure<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.420> made<00:00:45.450> by

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
sure about this this one was made by

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420 
sure about this this one was made by
code<00:00:46.050> crafted<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.649> thought<00:00:46.980> I'd<00:00:47.100> give<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
code crafted I thought I'd give it a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.660 
code crafted I thought I'd give it a
little<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:50.039> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> cool<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

that's pretty cool I thought I'd give it
a<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.280> suck<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.670> it

a go but I'm kind I kind of suck at it
but<00:01:42.119> there's<00:01:42.810> another<00:01:43.820> piano<00:01:44.820> tiles<00:01:45.270> type

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
but there's another piano tiles type

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870 
but there's another piano tiles type
don't<00:01:46.229> touch<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.649> white<00:01:46.799> tiles<00:01:47.100> map<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.549> also

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
don't touch the white tiles map I also

of that redstone all right let I think
we<00:03:06.660> should<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.870> begin<00:03:07.350> there's<00:03:07.530> no

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
we should just begin there's no

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.010 
we should just begin there's no
instruction<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.520> well<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.940> sort<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.330> all

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020

right wonder what this one is over here

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.960 
right wonder what this one is over here
I'm<00:04:06.330> guessing<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.840> one's<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.670> arcade<00:04:08.670> mode

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
I'm guessing this one's the arcade mode

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.460 
I'm guessing this one's the arcade mode
or<00:04:09.270> something<00:04:09.720> where<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.989> have<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.200> push<00:04:10.350> as

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
or something where you have to push as

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.229 
or something where you have to push as
many<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.010> before<00:04:11.190> time<00:04:11.550> runs<00:04:11.700> out<00:04:11.940> so

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
many as you can before time runs out so

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.840 
many as you can before time runs out so
let's<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:12.900> begin<00:04:13.250> randomizes<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.459> all

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
let's just begin randomizes that all

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.900 
let's just begin randomizes that all
right<00:04:15.060> let's<00:04:15.540> begin<00:04:15.750> three<00:04:16.200> two<00:04:16.799> one<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:17.850> go

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
right let's begin three two one and go

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.210 
right let's begin three two one and go
oh<00:04:18.690> oh<00:04:19.910> wow<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.419> failed<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:22.140> think<00:04:23.130> I

have to wait for the tiles to appear
okay<00:04:26.100> we'll<00:04:26.460> try<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.669> again<00:04:26.970> then

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
okay we'll try that again then
