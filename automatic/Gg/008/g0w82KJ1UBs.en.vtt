00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

I'm<00:00:00.900> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.230> show<00:00:01.380> you<00:00:01.410> how<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.680> play<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> five

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
I'm going to show you how to play a five

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.849 
I'm going to show you how to play a five
stroke<00:00:02.639> roll<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:03.360> then<00:00:03.990> demonstrate<00:00:04.589> some

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
stroke roll and then demonstrate some

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.509 
stroke roll and then demonstrate some
ways<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.220> can<00:00:05.370> use<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:05.790> on<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.089> drum<00:00:06.420> set<00:00:07.519> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
ways you can use that on a drum set the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.549 
ways you can use that on a drum set the
five<00:00:08.790> stroke<00:00:09.150> roll<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.450> basically<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
five stroke roll is basically a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.070 
five stroke roll is basically a
variation<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.340> double<00:00:11.670> stroke<00:00:11.910> roll<00:00:12.049> what<00:00:13.049> I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
variation of a double stroke roll what I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.890 
variation of a double stroke roll what I
mean<00:00:13.320> by<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.980> there's<00:00:14.849> two<00:00:15.120> rights<00:00:15.420> two

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
mean by that is there's two rights two

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.980 
mean by that is there's two rights two
left's<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.440> then<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.869> let<00:00:18.869> me

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
left's and then a right let me

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:43.280 
left's and then a right let me
demonstrate

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.139 

so<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.410> trick<00:00:44.649> is<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.920> be<00:00:45.309> able<00:00:45.399> to<00:00:45.579> start<00:00:45.969> a

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
so the trick is to be able to start a

00:00:46.149 --> 00:01:04.619 
so the trick is to be able to start a
five<00:00:46.390> stroke<00:00:46.750> roll<00:00:46.870> with<00:00:47.200> either<00:00:47.410> hand<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:04.449> if

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
five stroke roll with either hand now if

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.840 
five stroke roll with either hand now if
I<00:01:04.750> reverse<00:01:05.170> things<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.770> start<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.369> five<00:01:06.610> stroke

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
I reverse things and start a five stroke

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.810 
I reverse things and start a five stroke
roll<00:01:06.909> with<00:01:07.659> a<00:01:07.990> single<00:01:08.830> stroke<00:01:09.070> first<00:01:09.369> then<00:01:09.700> it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
roll with a single stroke first then it

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.210 
roll with a single stroke first then it
makes<00:01:10.000> for<00:01:10.630> some<00:01:10.750> interesting<00:01:10.990> variations<00:01:11.320> in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
makes for some interesting variations in

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.550 
makes for some interesting variations in
other<00:01:12.369> words<00:01:12.550> right<00:01:13.270> left<00:01:13.899> left<00:01:14.170> right<00:01:14.380> right

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
other words right left left right right

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:24.710 
other words right left left right right
or<00:01:15.520> left<00:01:16.060> left

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.700 

if<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.840> can<00:01:25.990> alternate<00:01:26.500> those<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:29.140> sounds

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
if I can alternate those it sounds

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.490 
if I can alternate those it sounds
pretty<00:01:30.220> neat<00:01:30.460> Lister<00:01:30.850> I'll<00:01:31.509> use<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.110> single

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
pretty neat Lister I'll use the single

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.160 
pretty neat Lister I'll use the single
hit<00:01:32.679> on<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.920> time<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.490> double<00:01:34.179> hits<00:01:34.390> down<00:01:34.869> here

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
hit on the time a double hits down here

00:01:35.170 --> 00:02:06.940 
hit on the time a double hits down here
slow<00:01:35.440> motion<00:01:47.580> here's<00:01:48.580> some<00:01:48.789> variations

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.230 

what<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.980> showed<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.490> how<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.670> play<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> five

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
what I showed you is how to play a five

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.270 
what I showed you is how to play a five
stroke<00:02:09.540> roll<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.020> even<00:02:10.350> make<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.100> sound

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
stroke roll and even make them sound

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
stroke roll and even make them sound
like<00:02:11.550> triplets<00:02:11.850> when<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.540> group<00:02:12.780> them

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
like triplets when you group them

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.470 
like triplets when you group them
together<00:02:13.370> now<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> double<00:02:14.820> stroke<00:02:15.030> roll<00:02:15.060> can

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
together now a double stroke roll can

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.910 
together now a double stroke roll can
get<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> lot<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:15.990> speed<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.350> versatility

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
get you a lot of speed and versatility

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
get you a lot of speed and versatility
now<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.090> add<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.540> couple<00:02:18.870> single<00:02:19.350> notes

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
now if you add a couple single notes

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.010 
now if you add a couple single notes
after<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.070> double<00:02:20.460> stroke<00:02:20.790> rolls<00:02:21.210> after<00:02:21.990> a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
after the double stroke rolls after a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.130 
after the double stroke rolls after a
five<00:02:22.290> stroke<00:02:22.620> roll<00:02:22.650> add<00:02:23.130> two<00:02:23.370> single<00:02:23.820> notes

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
five stroke roll add two single notes

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:49.120 
five stroke roll add two single notes
you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.440> some<00:02:25.620> interesting<00:02:25.920> patterns

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.470 

here's<00:02:50.130> some<00:02:50.310> applications<00:02:51.000> using<00:02:51.360> that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
here's some applications using that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.750 
here's some applications using that
pattern
