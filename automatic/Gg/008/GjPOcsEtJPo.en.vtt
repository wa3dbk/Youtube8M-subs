00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
it in front of it so it can constantly

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.870 
it in front of it so it can constantly
wet<00:02:39.660> down<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.530> next<00:02:40.830> place<00:02:45.050> just<00:02:46.050> close<00:02:46.260> down

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
wet down the next place just close down

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.680 
wet down the next place just close down
and<00:02:47.880> you're<00:02:48.000> done<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:51.180> should<00:02:51.210> not

and you're done with that it should not
look<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:56.930> okay<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.110> next<00:02:58.290> method<00:02:58.590> is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
look like this okay this next method is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.790 
look like this okay this next method is
gonna<00:02:59.280> be<00:03:00.320> traditional<00:03:01.320> method<00:03:01.620> where<00:03:01.739> you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
gonna be traditional method where you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.410 
gonna be traditional method where you
just<00:03:01.890> wet<00:03:02.130> down<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> window<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:03.300> an

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
just wet down the window and do an

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.350 
just wet down the window and do an
estimate<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:05.160> method<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.730> usually<00:03:05.880> used<00:03:06.209> for

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
estimate this method is usually used for

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.970 
estimate this method is usually used for
windows<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> lot<00:03:07.350> dirtier<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.830> you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
windows that get a lot dirtier and you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.070 
windows that get a lot dirtier and you
have<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.250> scrub<00:03:08.550> them<00:03:08.730> down<00:03:08.930> pretty<00:03:09.930> good<00:03:12.080> take

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
have to scrub them down pretty good take

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.500 
have to scrub them down pretty good take
your<00:03:13.260> squeegee<00:03:13.560> cut<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.520> top<00:03:14.790> left<00:03:15.209> or
