00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.420 
okay let's go through the four strumming
patterns<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.559> take<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> left<00:00:14.010> hand<00:00:14.100> out<00:00:14.370> of

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
patterns just take the left hand out of

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.609 
patterns just take the left hand out of
the<00:00:14.490> situation<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.150> muting<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.809> strings<00:00:15.960> hear

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
