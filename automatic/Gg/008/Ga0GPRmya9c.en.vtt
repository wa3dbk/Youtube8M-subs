00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:06.540
 knit plastic armature for this 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.540
 use hook 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.410
 now and demonstrate for this 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.239
 we use bolts with a diameter 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.699
 per millimeter millimeter you can believe 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.300
 approximately 200 pliers 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 millimeters from the pieces 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.279
 prepare your dependencies for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.470
 further procedure we fold in half 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.550
 wire 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:42.400
 start the blow mottura and use the key 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.580
 the first step is hook and dress 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:55.480
 The following tips upward matter right 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:57.990
 on the left we make a puff again 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.990
 fold in half 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:08.710
 start thinking motor on the hook 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.380
 cooked wire again 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.009
 we get tarkas key simplify our 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.009
 the job
