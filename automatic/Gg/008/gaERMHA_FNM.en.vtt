rudder is mapped 100% to channel one we
can<00:00:22.920> Matt<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.550> mix<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> second<00:00:24.689> channel

can Matt we can mix in a second channel

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.749 
can Matt we can mix in a second channel
we'll<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.470> same<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:30.019> rudder

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
we'll do the same thing rudder

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.940 
we'll do the same thing rudder
100%<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.880> channel<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:34.290> both<00:00:34.530> channels

100% on channel one now both channels
are<00:00:36.170> responding<00:00:37.579> we're<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> reverse

reverse<00:00:42.829> menu<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:53.550> we're<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:55.100> set

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
reverse menu but we're just going to set

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.029 
reverse menu but we're just going to set
a<00:00:57.109> weight<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.440> -<00:00:59.090> 100%

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
a weight of - 100%

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:10.060 
a weight of - 100%
likewise<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:05.400> reduced<00:01:05.850> rates

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:21.609 

say<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.310> example<00:01:11.760> 60%<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:14.280> set<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.670> value

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
say for example 60% you set that value

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
say for example 60% you set that value
to<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:24.890> switch<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
to do a a switch so like if we want to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.620 
to do a a switch so like if we want to
do<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> gear<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.590> control<00:01:31.579> channel<00:01:32.579> -<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.479> we're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
do a gear to control channel - and we're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.080 
do a gear to control channel - and we're
going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> delete<00:01:34.110> mix<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.770> channel<00:01:35.189> 2<00:01:35.750> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
going to delete mix on channel 2 and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.090 
going to delete mix on channel 2 and
we're<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.420> add<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> we're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
we're going to add so we're going to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
we're going to add so we're going to
select<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:46.110> source<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.340> full<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.049> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
select the source to be full and the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.789 
select the source to be full and the
full<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> return<00:01:50.549> either<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.540> -<00:01:52.020> 100%

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
full is going to return either a - 100%

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.160 
full is going to return either a - 100%
or<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> plus<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.880> hundred<00:01:54.210> percent<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> by<00:01:56.219> itself

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
or a plus a hundred percent so by itself

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.420 
or a plus a hundred percent so by itself
we<00:01:58.170> don't<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.710> channel<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> do<00:02:00.479> anything<00:02:01.430> but

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
we don't see channel to do anything but

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
we don't see channel to do anything but
then<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.899> we're

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
then what we're going to do is we're

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.310 
then what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> come<00:02:05.219> down<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.270> we're<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
going to come down and we're going to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.470 
going to come down and we're going to
map

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
map

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:18.390 
map
the<00:02:10.480> switch<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.700> be<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.060> gear<00:02:13.420> switch<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:17.400> now

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the switch to be the gear switch and now

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.260 
the switch to be the gear switch and now
that<00:02:19.210> switch<00:02:20.640> will<00:02:21.640> control<00:02:24.090> channel<00:02:25.090> 2

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
that switch will control channel 2

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.790 
that switch will control channel 2
presumably<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.960> gear<00:02:26.170> something<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> nice

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
presumably the gear something the nice

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.640 
presumably the gear something the nice
thing<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:28.270> switches<00:02:28.630> are<00:02:28.960> equal<00:02:29.290> so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
thing is all the switches are equal so

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.230 
thing is all the switches are equal so
you<00:02:29.680> can<00:02:29.890> map<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.400> onto<00:02:30.580> what<00:02:30.880> are<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> dual

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
you can map that onto what are the dual

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.730 
you can map that onto what are the dual
rates<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.810> doesn't<00:02:32.080> matter<00:02:32.230> they're<00:02:32.470> just

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
rates it doesn't matter they're just

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.790 
rates it doesn't matter they're just
named<00:02:33.160> switches<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.000> there's<00:02:34.720> no<00:02:35.020> predefined

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
named switches and there's no predefined

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.570 
named switches and there's no predefined
operations<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.480> are<00:02:37.690> done<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.290> any<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.400> those

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
operations that are done on any of those

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.940 
operations that are done on any of those
now<00:02:40.420> we'll<00:02:40.600> have<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.810> quick<00:02:41.140> example<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.890> how<00:02:41.950> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
now we'll have a quick example of how to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.700 
now we'll have a quick example of how to
combine<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.340> mix<00:02:46.030> we're<00:02:46.630> going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> we're<00:02:47.560> going

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
combine a mix we're going to we're going

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.880 
combine a mix we're going to we're going

to do the elevator I mean I'm sorry the
we're<00:02:50.890> going<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> throttle<00:02:51.910> with<00:02:52.570> a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
we're going to do the throttle with a

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.160 
we're going to do the throttle with a
throttle<00:02:53.140> hold<00:02:53.380> switch<00:02:54.690> will<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.020> on

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
throttle hold switch will do this on

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.930 
throttle hold switch will do this on

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
channel 1 we're going to say map that to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.310 
channel 1 we're going to say map that to
the<00:03:00.970> throttle<00:03:01.600> as<00:03:02.590> we<00:03:03.310> expect<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:05.170> we're

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
the throttle as we expect and then we're

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.830 
the throttle as we expect and then we're
going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> come<00:03:05.650> over<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.760> see<00:03:07.690> where

going to come over here and see where

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.990 
going to come over here and see where

in<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> mix<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.459> take<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.630> as

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
in the mix we're going to take that as

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:27.960 
in the mix we're going to take that as
the<00:03:19.030> source<00:03:19.300> full<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:23.160> we're<00:03:24.160> going<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:26.970> set

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the source full and we're going to set

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.280 
the source full and we're going to set
the<00:03:28.150> switch<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:29.620> throttle<00:03:30.070> hold<00:03:31.140> we're<00:03:32.140> going

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the switch to throttle hold we're going

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.070 
the switch to throttle hold we're going
to<00:03:32.380> set<00:03:32.620> multiplex<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:34.300> be<00:03:34.480> replace<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:37.080> we're

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
to set multiplex to be replace and we're

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:53.140 
to set multiplex to be replace and we're
going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.260> set<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.800> weight<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:41.020> be<00:03:41.290> minus<00:03:42.130> 100

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.180 

and<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.420> what<00:03:54.630> we<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:54.990> see<00:03:55.350> here<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:58.190> the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
and so what we can see here is when the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.510 
and so what we can see here is when the
throttle<00:03:59.760> switch<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.840> down<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:05.070> throttle

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
throttle switch is down the throttle

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.330 
throttle switch is down the throttle
works<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.240> if<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.260> pull<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.680> throttle<00:04:07.950> switch

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
works and if we pull the throttle switch

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.370 
works and if we pull the throttle switch
up<00:04:08.840> then<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.080> locked<00:04:10.410> because<00:04:11.010> it's

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
up then it's locked because it's

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.680 
up then it's locked because it's
replacing<00:04:13.380> with<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> managed<00:04:14.610> 100%<00:04:15.240> now<00:04:15.510> we

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
replacing with a managed 100% now we

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.870 
replacing with a managed 100% now we
actually<00:04:15.959> want<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:17.010> differently<00:04:17.579> so

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
actually want to do this differently so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.909 
actually want to do this differently so
that<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.150> default<00:04:18.570> position<00:04:19.140> of<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> switch

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
that the default position of the switch

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.870 
that the default position of the switch
is<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:22.560> safe<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.190> what<00:04:23.340> we're<00:04:23.490> going<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.669> do

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
is is the safe so what we're going to do

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.720 
is is the safe so what we're going to do
is<00:04:24.180> we'll<00:04:26.030> change<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.510> be<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:29.490> bang

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
is we'll change that to be the bang

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.700 
is we'll change that to be the bang
throttle<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.540> exclamation<00:04:31.080> point<00:04:31.110> throttle

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
throttle the exclamation point throttle

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.570 
throttle the exclamation point throttle
and<00:04:32.060> now<00:04:33.060> when<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.110> switch<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.440> down<00:04:34.860> nothing

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
and now when the switch is down nothing

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.100 
and now when the switch is down nothing
happens<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.680> when<00:04:37.680> we<00:04:37.860> pull<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.250> switch<00:04:38.520> up

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
happens and when we pull the switch up

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.880 
happens and when we pull the switch up
then<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.290> have<00:04:40.530> full<00:04:41.190> throttle<00:04:41.760> control

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
then we have full throttle control

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.350 
then we have full throttle control
anyway<00:04:43.890> as<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.100> leave<00:04:44.340> some<00:04:44.580> comments<00:04:45.030> below<00:04:45.330> if
