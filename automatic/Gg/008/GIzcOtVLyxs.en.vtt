modes<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.409> even<00:03:02.500> lay<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.859> down<00:03:03.069> for<00:03:03.370> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
modes and you can even lay it down for a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.089 
modes and you can even lay it down for a
more<00:03:04.019> typing<00:03:05.019> angle<00:03:05.260> gives<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.769> little<00:03:05.889> bit<00:03:06.010> of

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
more typing angle gives a little bit of

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.610 
more typing angle gives a little bit of
a<00:03:06.219> bounce<00:03:06.459> there<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.569> check<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:07.989> out<00:03:08.409> this

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
a bounce there but check this out this

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.490 
a bounce there but check this out this
is<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:10.209> very<00:03:10.329> different<00:03:10.930> than<00:03:11.230> what<00:03:11.379> I've

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
is it's very different than what I've

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.099 
is it's very different than what I've
seen<00:03:12.030> yeah<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.299> just<00:03:13.510> saw<00:03:13.659> that<00:03:13.689> right

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
seen yeah you just saw that right

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.220 
seen yeah you just saw that right
there's<00:03:14.439> velcro<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> back<00:03:15.189> here<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.230> what

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
there's velcro on the back here so what

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.039 
there's velcro on the back here so what
that<00:03:17.409> does<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.340> couple<00:03:18.909> of<00:03:19.030> things<00:03:19.060> one<00:03:19.419> I

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
that does is a couple of things one I

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.930 
that does is a couple of things one I
guess<00:03:20.620> if<00:03:20.979> you<00:03:21.099> wanted<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.639> could<00:03:21.790> use

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
guess if you wanted to you could use

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.819 
guess if you wanted to you could use
this<00:03:22.120> case<00:03:22.359> like<00:03:22.599> this<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.169> purpose<00:03:23.680> of

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
this case like this but the purpose of

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.780 
this case like this but the purpose of
that<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.669> you<00:03:25.389> take<00:03:25.569> this<00:03:25.720> velcro<00:03:26.790> hopefully

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
that is you take this velcro hopefully

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.879 
that is you take this velcro hopefully
I'm<00:03:27.879> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.269> right<00:03:28.569> you<00:03:29.560> put<00:03:29.799> it

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
I'm going to do this right you put it

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.929 
I'm going to do this right you put it
there<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:31.389> have<00:03:31.599> a<00:03:31.659> stand<00:03:32.109> like<00:03:32.680> this

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
there and now you have a stand like this

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.479 
there and now you have a stand like this
so<00:03:33.939> there<00:03:34.689> have<00:03:34.870> been<00:03:35.079> other<00:03:35.319> cases<00:03:35.409> that<00:03:36.069> I've

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
so there have been other cases that I've

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.050 
so there have been other cases that I've
seen<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.199> a<00:03:38.229> rotation<00:03:38.799> mechanism<00:03:39.189> but

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
seen that have a rotation mechanism but

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.670 
seen that have a rotation mechanism but
they<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.329> hole<00:03:40.629> in<00:03:40.659> the<00:03:40.930> back<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.590> you

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
they have a hole in the back and so you

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.309 
they have a hole in the back and so you
have<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.859> big<00:03:42.069> area<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.519> exposure<00:03:43.079> they've<00:03:44.079> gone

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
have a big area of exposure they've gone

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.899 
have a big area of exposure they've gone
a<00:03:44.379> different<00:03:44.620> route<00:03:44.979> with<00:03:45.189> this<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.639> which<00:03:45.879> is

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
a different route with this one which is

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.599 
a different route with this one which is
pretty<00:03:46.269> ingenious<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:47.169> my<00:03:47.319> opinion<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:48.549> is

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
pretty ingenious in my opinion it is

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.819 
pretty ingenious in my opinion it is
going<00:03:48.939> to<00:03:49.000> add<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.299> bulk<00:03:49.509> that<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.840> saw<00:03:50.109> but

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
going to add the bulk that you saw but

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.800 
going to add the bulk that you saw but
it's<00:03:50.979> definitely<00:03:51.189> something<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.419> much

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
it's definitely something that is much

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.179 
it's definitely something that is much
different<00:03:53.349> than<00:03:53.439> what<00:03:53.590> I've<00:03:53.709> seen<00:03:53.919> in<00:03:54.099> the

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
different than what I've seen in the

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.979 
different than what I've seen in the
past<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:55.199> very<00:03:56.199> different<00:03:56.919> in<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.099> regard

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
past so very different in that regard

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.899 
past so very different in that regard
again<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.229> am<00:03:59.500> NOT<00:03:59.739> going<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.069> give<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.549> final

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
again I am NOT going to give a final

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.229 
again I am NOT going to give a final
review<00:04:01.299> score<00:04:01.810> on<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.319> particular<00:04:02.739> case

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
review score on this particular case

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.819 
review score on this particular case
until<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.299> get<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.689> final<00:04:04.930> production<00:04:05.349> run<00:04:05.799> of

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
until I get the final production run of

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.640 
until I get the final production run of
it<00:04:06.099> but<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.879> is<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.150> poetic<00:04:07.629> adoro<00:04:08.049> book<00:04:08.379> and
