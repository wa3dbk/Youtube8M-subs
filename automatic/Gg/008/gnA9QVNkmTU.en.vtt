baton this knife through it took me

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.520 
baton this knife through it took me
about<00:02:07.560> two<00:02:07.799> hours<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:09.300> camping<00:02:10.200> trip<00:02:10.349> because

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
about two hours a camping trip because

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.470 
about two hours a camping trip because
we<00:02:10.649> need<00:02:10.800> firewood<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.760> mad<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.330> cut

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
we need firewood really mad so I was cut

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.190 
we need firewood really mad so I was cut
an<00:02:12.569> entire<00:02:12.840> tree
