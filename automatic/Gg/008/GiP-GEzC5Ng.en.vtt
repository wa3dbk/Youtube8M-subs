bypass<00:03:12.079> digestion<00:03:12.680> I've<00:03:13.010> always<00:03:13.189> said<00:03:13.459> this

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
bypass digestion I've always said this

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.909 
bypass digestion I've always said this
go<00:03:14.060> straight<00:03:14.359> in<00:03:14.450> your<00:03:14.480> damp<00:03:14.780> muscles<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.409> get

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
go straight in your damp muscles and get

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.339 
go straight in your damp muscles and get
your<00:03:16.099> results<00:03:16.370> now<00:03:16.939> I<00:03:16.969> gotta<00:03:17.239> another<00:03:17.989> thing

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
your results now I gotta another thing

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.469 
your results now I gotta another thing
to<00:03:18.470> make<00:03:18.650> with<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> beta<00:03:19.699> alanine<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.269> also

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479 
to make with the beta alanine it also

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.030 
to make with the beta alanine it also
has<00:03:20.629> been<00:03:20.750> showing<00:03:21.049> enhanced<00:03:21.530> strength<00:03:21.709> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
has been showing enhanced strength and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.399 
has been showing enhanced strength and
endurance<00:03:23.199> so<00:03:24.199> another<00:03:25.209> thing<00:03:26.209> app<00:03:26.900> says<00:03:27.229> i

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
endurance so another thing app says i

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.899 
endurance so another thing app says i
did<00:03:27.650> try<00:03:27.829> this<00:03:27.949> back<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.549> day<00:03:28.729> and<00:03:28.790> i<00:03:28.879> have

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
did try this back in the day and i have

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.330 
did try this back in the day and i have
used<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.449> when<00:03:30.409> they<00:03:30.500> were<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.650> competitor<00:03:31.159> and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
used it when they were a competitor and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.429 
used it when they were a competitor and
I<00:03:31.819> will<00:03:32.030> say<00:03:32.269> entra<00:03:32.599> Pollock<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.079> damn<00:03:33.409> good

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 
I will say entra Pollock is a damn good

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.140 
I will say entra Pollock is a damn good
product<00:03:34.129> it's<00:03:34.579> one<00:03:34.729> of<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:34.909> better

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
