00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 hello I hope you are very well I am 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.510
 mireia and welcome to another tutorial 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.740
 in today's tutorial we will make headbands 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.440
 with chains we are going to need a ribbon of 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.720
 Various colors silicon plastic bases 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.279
 for tiaras and chains all this what 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.279
 you can find in fantasies miguel 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.990
 the first thing is to take the measure of the 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.619
 headband with the chain and cut what 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.619
 we will need 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 now we will take the bar and we will pass a 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.079
 lighter by the tips so that it does not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 undo 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.190
 we will pass a ribbon edge by the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.089
 first link in the chain that we cut 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.089
 and we will make a knot 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.670
 then we will go through the other end of the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.980
 ribbon first up and then through 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.610
 down on each of the links up 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.610
 get to the end 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.240
 at the end of the chain we will make a knot 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.240
 with the ribbon and ready 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.030
 now we will attach the chain to the headband 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.030
 of plastic putting some silicone 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
 at the end we will stick the edge of the ribbon 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 that we stayed on the inside part of 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.610
 the headband in this way 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 now we will put silicon on the part of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.190
 inside and we roll a little of the ribbon 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.080
 to form the tips 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.080
 we do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.090
 and our headband will be ready 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.120
 as they are thin headbands you can use 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.120
 several and combine colors 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.030
