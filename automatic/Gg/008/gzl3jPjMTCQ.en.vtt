so if we go to crop let's have a look at

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.490 
so if we go to crop let's have a look at
it<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.670> say<00:02:02.880> crop<00:02:03.210> okay<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.289> there<00:02:04.470> are

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
straightaway you've got this rectangle

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
straightaway you've got this rectangle
and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.020> move<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.830> fingers

might<00:02:08.459> expect<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.630> if<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.959> look<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.769> first

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
might expect so if we look at this first

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
might expect so if we look at this first
graph<00:02:11.130> say<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:11.849> one<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> those<00:02:12.180> lights<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
graph say I don't one of those lights in

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.360 
graph say I don't one of those lights in
the<00:02:13.140> background<00:02:13.530> there<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.980> big<00:02:14.190> light

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the background there that big light

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.870 
the background there that big light
there<00:02:15.049> that'll<00:02:16.049> do<00:02:16.170> nicely<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.519> we<00:02:17.670> just

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
there that'll do nicely and then we just

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.820 
there that'll do nicely and then we just
take<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:19.620> done

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
take it like that and then that's done

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.289 
take it like that and then that's done
so<00:02:20.100> there<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.400> are<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.700> cropped<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
so there we are that's cropped and

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.039 
so there we are that's cropped and
that's<00:02:21.450> all<00:02:21.600> good<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:22.680> about<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.069> exposure

we've<00:03:11.630> got<00:03:11.840> obviously<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.200> brightness<00:03:13.900> again

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
we've got obviously the brightness again

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.440 
we've got obviously the brightness again
just<00:03:15.830> using<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.400> by<00:03:16.580> sliding<00:03:16.850> your<00:03:17.150> finger

so superb and easy to manage and it and
it<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.750> made<00:03:26.930> us<00:03:27.080> -<00:03:27.290> brightness<00:03:29.170> that'll<00:03:30.170> do

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
it it made us - brightness that'll do

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.000 
it it made us - brightness that'll do
that'll<00:03:30.560> do<00:03:30.710> mean<00:03:30.890> let's<00:03:31.100> take<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:33.010> so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
that'll do mean let's take that and so

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.440 
that'll do mean let's take that and so
all<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.370> standard<00:03:34.730> things<00:03:34.880> you<00:03:34.970> expect<00:03:35.240> with

all the standard things you expect with
some<00:03:35.780> simple<00:03:36.110> editing<00:03:36.200> software<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:37.070> so

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
some simple editing software it's so

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.230 
some simple editing software it's so
easy<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.850> use

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
easy to use

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.720 
easy to use
not<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> problem<00:03:38.930> tool<00:03:39.610> soft<00:03:40.610> focus<00:03:40.850> again<00:03:42.730> it's

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
not a problem tool soft focus again it's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.870 
not a problem tool soft focus again it's
a<00:03:43.850> it's<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.180> finger<00:03:44.480> slide<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:46.250> we<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:46.610> click

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
a it's a finger slide if we just click

a it's a finger slide if we just click
there<00:03:47.950> right<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.070> see<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> number<00:03:49.550> at<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
there right you see the number at the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.270 
there right you see the number at the
top<00:03:49.880> there<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.330> that<00:03:50.990> will<00:03:51.140> determine<00:03:51.410> how

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
top there and that will determine how

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.560 
top there and that will determine how
much<00:03:52.430> soft<00:03:52.700> focus<00:03:52.910> oh<00:03:53.150> look<00:03:53.300> at<00:03:53.420> that

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
much soft focus oh look at that

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.800 
much soft focus oh look at that
too<00:03:54.080> soft<00:03:54.320> there

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.800 

berry<00:03:57.350> softer

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
berry softer

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.410 
berry softer
what<00:04:00.410> we<00:04:00.590> want<00:04:00.830> is

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.510 

and<00:04:05.630> my<00:04:06.530> phone<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:06.920> takes<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.190> little<00:04:07.310> while<00:04:07.460> to

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
and my phone it takes a little while to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.420 
and my phone it takes a little while to
catch<00:04:07.760> up<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.330> I'm<00:04:08.480> sure<00:04:08.510> on<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:09.220> faster<00:04:10.220> phone

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
catch up but I'm sure on a faster phone

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
you wouldn't really have that kind of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.420 
you wouldn't really have that kind of
problem<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:14.630> working<00:04:14.840> they're<00:04:15.430> probably

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
problem so it's working they're probably

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.620 
problem so it's working they're probably
a<00:04:16.579> bit<00:04:16.700> too<00:04:16.730> soft<00:04:17.120> there<00:04:17.420> I<00:04:18.760> mean<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:20.000> know

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630

that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.369 
that
and<00:04:31.650> then<00:04:32.490> finally<00:04:33.060> effects<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:33.990> borders<00:04:34.319> so
