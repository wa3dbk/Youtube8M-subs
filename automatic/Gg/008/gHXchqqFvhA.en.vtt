00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 now starts the newspaper bus channel 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 with the following details it is already possible 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.369
 cycling on the banks of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 to increase the benefits of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.109
 to the auxiliary environment in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
 classification of urban transport and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.320
 meet a need to reduce 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 costs 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.440
 vf features automatic transmission of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.440
 six marches for city buses 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.910
 it is possible to travel by bus and take 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.360
 bicycle for free 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.579
 the initiative is the comet company 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.280
 of road buses serving the 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.170
 states of sao paulo 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.500
 January and Parana 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.500
 a lot of people have always wanted to travel 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.140
 take the bike to get around and even 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.020
 even have fun at travel destinations 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.479
 but this is not always possible because 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.810
 cost and bureaucracy for the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.210
 road transport now 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.399
 passenger can take at no cost to 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.179
 the bicycle since you travel in the same 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.369
 bus free transportation to lonely 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.140
 for one bicycle per passenger that 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.800
 It should be taken in the compartment 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.509
 Used bicycles not used 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.330
 need an invoice 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.659
 the initiative came from an idea posted 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.479
 on the official kite page on facebook 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.739
 the company decided to bet on the networks 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.869
 Both Twitter and Facebook do 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:54.020
 company are used for the dissemination of 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.410
 curiosities and also for a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.489
 greater approximation between passengers and 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.429
 aviation 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:08.330
 pages are also 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:11.900
 promotions vs presents new broadcast 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.780
 automatic and promises reduction of up to 6% 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.360
 consumption of diesel as well as lower 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.910
 emission of pollutants 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.000
 the first differential that cef says 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.010
 the new automatic transmission system 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.379
 for urban buses is that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.420
 he has six second marches 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.150
 manufacturer makes the engine 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.170
 operates at lower speeds and up to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.569
 6% - diesel oil and also pollute less in 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.849
 previous transmissions 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.250
 other items in the broadcast also 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.980
 help save fuel and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.440
 increase the safety of operations 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.300
 one of them is the primary retarder that 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.569
 can reduce the speed of the bus 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.550
 up to 4 kilometers per hour without 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.620
 require nothing from the conventional brake 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.680
 the system identifies the level of consumption 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.010
 and force depending on the operation 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480
 the test drive performed by cef 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.090
 computers were connected to the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.580
 and showed these features of the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.040
 apple life here the sign of the bar 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.140
 shows that the bus is in the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 stretch that requires more strength 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.580
 already in flat or downhill locations 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.830
 transmission already identifies a 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.830
 requirement of the vehicle, which is also 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.110
 demonstrated on the screen used in the test drive 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.140
 all this is possible through a system of 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.020
 transmission called the top of em that 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.870
 every 10 meters calculates the weight of the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.000
 and the topography of the route as 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.650
 explains the development manager of 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.230
 cef business 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.930
 alexandre mackerel program him today 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.910
 calls in top life and was only able to 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.600
 The team collected it is a program 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.970
 single 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.260
 only that it has the capacity in a period 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.300
 within a distance of less than 10 meters 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.130
 check how the topography is taken into account 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.360
 what is the load the vehicle is and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.340
 it does an automatic programming 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040
 saying the engine needs more or 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.870
 less performance need less 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.670
 performance means he can 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.530
 consume less fuel than are 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.239
 more performance it needs a bit of 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.489
 strength to climb to topography 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.220
 causing the vehicle before form 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.100
 efficient and consuming or less or 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.239
 least possible and intelligent system 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.400
 communication with the motor and 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.960
 verification of the vehicle in that 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.370
 period of 10 meters 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.400
 he can always be programming 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.200
 along the way the executive of cf 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.570
 also said that the market for 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.120
 automatic transmission for buses has 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.370
 grown in Brazil even more 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.040
 context of the needs of 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.750
 modernization of urban mobility 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.190
 today we think any 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.010
 development that is done globally 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.070
 We think about improving transportation 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.470
 as a whole, it is not enough to think only of 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.740
 technology of what Joseph is developing in 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.410
 benefits that an operator or fleet 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.360
 own driver, the population and all 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.860
 people directly and indirectly 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.630
 related to transport can obtain 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.000
 through this benefit which are 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.229
 developed by the companies among them 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.340
 We can mention the transmission 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.350
 automatic 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.570
 today the automatic transmission is 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.020
 is already made for buses to develop 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.550
 by bus to urban transport and 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.230
 Today, he already has the great 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.330
 Most of its applications that the 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.760
 urban transport with articulated buses 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.220
 bi-articulated buses and standard buses 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.990
 current given in the articulated bus and 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.710
 thinking already in the set of 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.480
 brt 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.180
 you need technology also has 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.430
 throughout the process. 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.380
 In this you can see a box 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.550
 automatic driver he manages to 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.740
 100% focus on the operation he can 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.170
 reduce the number of accidents and this 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.990
 also helps fuel consumption 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.540
 to show entrepreneurs in the sector of 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.420
 transport and public managers a new 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.150
 cef automatic transmission system 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.640
 traveled with this bus between the months 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.950
 April and August more than 20 thousand 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.910
 kilometers in 15 cities of seven 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.920
 States 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.780
 despite the growth of the bus fleet 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.750
 urban automatic 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.640
 the number is still small with 20% of 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.040
 total number of vehicles and several businessmen 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.190
 still have doubts about 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.040
 cost-effectiveness of systems with 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:26.250
 technicians and cláudio lopes de são paulo a 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.750
 amil bazani did you accompany the newspaper 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.000
 bus channel 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.000
