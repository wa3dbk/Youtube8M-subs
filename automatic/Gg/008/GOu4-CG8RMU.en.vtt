00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
like a little puzzle piece here and it's

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.880 
like a little puzzle piece here and it's
rolling<00:04:44.090> around<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:45.010> heart-shaped<00:04:46.010> can

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
I could actually guide it from above if

I could actually guide it from above if
I<00:05:14.660> release<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.230> from<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.560> little<00:05:15.770> arm<00:05:16.130> and
