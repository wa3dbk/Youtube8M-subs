00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.140
 today for a new video that 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.390
 is going to be a tutorial you have me 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.610
 hugely asked all week 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.530
 last and even a little advanced a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.610
 back to school tutorial I confess 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.049
 that I asked myself a lot 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 whether you're in the iron or not because we 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 find a lot of videos like this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.859
 on youtube and I really 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.580
 content and to repeat the reasons that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.080
 I could find 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.000
 so obviously I think that's 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 tutorial will be aimed at the youngest 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 of you because I can not see 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.289
 older bear this stuff to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.270
 the university or even in high school or after 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 in business school etc 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 no matter what you do as 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.920
 studies but here I do them I think 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.870
 that I will make another video but with 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480
 a and martin can more classic and a 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.129
 little more wearable we will say for the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 older of you something that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.780
 is much more discreet and with 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 less drawing so I decided to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.110
 to make an enarque difference on each 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.030
 finger I'm going to start by applying 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 obviously my base as usual 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.379
 and then after the colors so I 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.800
 taken for it just yellow of the white and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.800
 of black 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.290
 on the little finger I'm just going to do 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.680
 small strokes to actually make 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.120
 a very simple cv rule to do the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.310
 black I took inked from China 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.530
 but obviously you can use 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.540
 painting or also black varnish 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.680
 if you have a little fine brush 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.229
 will amply suffice 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 so I drew the 1 and the 2 next 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.170
 but under the camera I really arrived 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.190
 not to do it so I withdrew my hand 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 from the camera 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.820
 on the middle finger I'm just going to take 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.530
 the light blue paint and I'm going 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.450
 draw lines like to make a 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.520
 sheet of paper I 'm losing lines 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.860
 horizontal and when the blue will be dry 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.650
 I'm going to make a red vertical line 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.420
 to make the margin of my leaf the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.979
 traits are not extremely straight in 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.030
 am quite conscious again a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.160
 time it's because I'm on the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.780
 tripod from the camera and that like 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.700
 usually I only see part of 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.770
 my fingernail and I do not see the other part 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.850
 So it was not easy for 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 those of you who have nails 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.940
 bombay and who have a little trouble doing 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.800
 straight lines like that there is a 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.730
 little trick which obviously finally that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.260
 obviously I have not implemented 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.239
 for this video but what I'm doing 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.820
 normally actually instead of moving 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.530
 your brush move your finger does the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.510
 switch from left to right and that allows 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.800
 to keep a semblance of straight lines 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.239
 or at least it's still a lot 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.750
 easier to do something to 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.750
 almost right 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.890
 on my ring finger I'm just going to do 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.900
 an addition i'm going to score just a 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.060
 more with white paint you 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.740
 can also take white polish 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.820
 it's exactly the same you just have to 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.920
 to go a little bit faster because 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.570
 your white polish will become pretty dough 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.750
 quickly but we can still 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.750
 make 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.520
 according to the index I will draw the tip 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.470
 of a wooden pencil in fact so I'm going 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.550
 just make red strokes on top I 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.530
 do not go all the way because 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.000
 you without it will be covered by a 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.370
 nail polish I'm going to take a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 nail polish so the rose and I'm going 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.390
 recover all the bottom of my nail in 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.390
 does the pencil eraser 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.960
 and to finish I will put some walleye 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.540
 to actually do it will be the little one 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.670
 ring that connects the pencil to the eraser 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.010
 Thank you for your explanations Cecile 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.720
 and then and then it's over I'll 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.510
 cover with matte varnish me 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.640
 I use the mat of proud bourgeois who 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.560
 is still relatively good I 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.720
 even if it's not my favorite have 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.130
 preferred matting varnish and that of 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.140
 china slips but we find it pretty 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.670
 hardly in France so for 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.630
 the moment I'm content with the bourgeois 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.160
 who does his job well 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.210
 even if he puts a little more time 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.460
 to dry 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.830
 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.420
 and you may want to 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.370
 reproduce if this is the case do not hesitate 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.320
 to show me all your photos as 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.370
 usually and then I'm curious 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.730
 I would like to know what you are 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.620
 make 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.970
 this year if you still do some 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.320
 studies what are you going to do from 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.910
 your school year so tell me 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.500
 in the comments I make you 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.160
 big kisses and I tell you to Saturday for 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.160
 the next video
