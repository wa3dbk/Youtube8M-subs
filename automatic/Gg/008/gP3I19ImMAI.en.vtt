indeed glass 77 has a larger area for

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.720 
indeed glass 77 has a larger area for
model<00:02:44.000> railroading<00:02:44.420> than<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.200> have<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.950> he<00:02:46.489> has

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
model railroading than I have and he has

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.960 
model railroading than I have and he has
some<00:02:46.970> nice<00:02:48.190> locomotives<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.400> things<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.879> he

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
some nice locomotives and things and he

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.410 
some nice locomotives and things and he
does<00:02:50.180> great<00:02:50.420> modeling<00:02:51.019> work<00:02:52.120> some<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.150> his

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
does great modeling work some of his

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.140 
does great modeling work some of his
trees<00:02:54.040> bunches<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.069> he<00:02:55.340> didn't<00:02:55.670> love<00:02:55.819> his

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
trees bunches that he didn't love his

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.080 
trees bunches that he didn't love his
Ridge<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.659> his<00:02:56.810> rock<00:02:57.049> formations<00:02:57.739> are<00:02:58.730> really

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
Ridge and his rock formations are really

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.210 
Ridge and his rock formations are really
outstanding<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:01.040> there's<00:03:01.879> different

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
outstanding so there's different

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.569 
outstanding so there's different
abilities<00:03:04.220> within<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.849> hobby<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:06.739> when

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
abilities within the hobby and so when

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.039 
abilities within the hobby and so when
we<00:03:07.730> think<00:03:07.970> about<00:03:08.120> what<00:03:08.540> we're<00:03:08.690> going<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.930> do

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
we think about what we're going to do

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.080 
we think about what we're going to do
with<00:03:09.200> our<00:03:09.349> model<00:03:09.500> railroad<00:03:10.099> first<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.640> need<00:03:10.819> to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
with our model railroad first we need to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.690 
with our model railroad first we need to
put<00:03:11.959> ourself<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.530> one<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.799> those<00:03:12.950> categories

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
put ourself in one of those categories

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.699 
put ourself in one of those categories
so<00:03:13.730> we<00:03:13.940> know<00:03:14.209> what<00:03:14.420> our<00:03:14.450> limitations<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.410> are

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
so we know what our limitations you are

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.000 
so we know what our limitations you are
either<00:03:16.069> by<00:03:16.370> size<00:03:16.700> or<00:03:17.150> by<00:03:17.450> finances<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.379> then

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
either by size or by finances and then

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.009 
either by size or by finances and then
work<00:03:19.609> to<00:03:20.599> get<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.049> most<00:03:21.319> bang<00:03:21.739> for<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.250> buck<00:03:22.280> I

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
work to get the most bang for the buck I

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.250 
work to get the most bang for the buck I
have<00:03:24.250> my<00:03:25.250> locomotives<00:03:26.000> or<00:03:26.150> Bachman<00:03:26.690> I've<00:03:27.079> got

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
have my locomotives or Bachman I've got

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.589 
have my locomotives or Bachman I've got
a<00:03:27.290> drawer<00:03:27.620> for<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.890> full<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.549> third<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:28.940> in

I mean I I'm not going to use them

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.069 
I mean I I'm not going to use them
anymore<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.430> maybe<00:03:38.060> I'll<00:03:38.329> do<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.510> video<00:03:38.690> and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
then you can get a pretty good railroad

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.620 
then you can get a pretty good railroad
in<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.500> small<00:04:00.799> amount<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.220> space<00:04:01.370> my<00:04:01.970> railroad

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
in a small amount of space my railroad

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.240 
in a small amount of space my railroad
if<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.930> take<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.319> time<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.769> look<00:04:03.859> at<00:04:03.980> some<00:04:04.130> of

if you take the time and look at some of
my<00:04:04.280> videos<00:04:04.730> my<00:04:05.389> railroad<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.169> have<00:04:06.560> will

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
my videos my railroad that I have will

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.720 
my videos my railroad that I have will
fit<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.480> area<00:04:09.019> if<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.440> had<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.859> former<00:04:10.519> eight

fit on a area if you had a former eight
piece<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.780> plywood<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.560> then<00:04:12.709> added<00:04:13.099> another

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
piece of plywood and then added another

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.220 
piece of plywood and then added another
four<00:04:13.760> foot<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.419> or<00:04:14.690> three<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.079> half

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
feet to the end of it you could get all

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.719 
feet to the end of it you could get all
of<00:04:17.269> my<00:04:17.450> model<00:04:17.959> railroad<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:19.099> space

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
of my model railroad in that space

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.659 
of my model railroad in that space
it's<00:04:20.599> that<00:04:20.870> simple<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.530> will<00:04:21.739> all<00:04:21.919> fit<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.460> that

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
it's that simple it will all fit in that

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.480 
it's that simple it will all fit in that
space<00:04:23.020> so<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.080> don't<00:04:24.530> have<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.889> have<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.099> room
