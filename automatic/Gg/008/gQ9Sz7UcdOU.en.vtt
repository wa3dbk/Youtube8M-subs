the<00:02:26.200> horse<00:02:26.409> doesn't<00:02:26.739> realize<00:02:27.069> what<00:02:27.489> he's<00:02:27.610> done

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the horse doesn't realize what he's done

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.949 
the horse doesn't realize what he's done
the<00:02:27.910> horse<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.269> wants<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.569> carrot<00:02:28.870> or

the horse just wants a carrot or
whatever<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.680> attitude<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.120> sports

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900

whatever and I attitude of the sports
commentary<00:02:32.440> world<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.459> thought<00:02:33.670> was

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
commentary world I thought was

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.180 
commentary world I thought was
interesting<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:35.110> live<00:02:35.319> kind<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.709> in<00:02:35.950> a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
interesting because we live kind of in a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.830 
interesting because we live kind of in a
time<00:02:36.370> when<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.879> lot<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.150> animals<00:02:37.599> are<00:02:37.720> being

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
time when a lot of animals are being

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.960 
time when a lot of animals are being
humanized<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.069> this<00:02:39.190> instance<00:02:39.430> they're

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
humanized but in this instance they're

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
humanized but in this instance they're
going<00:02:40.209> well<00:02:40.450> he's<00:02:40.659> a<00:02:40.690> horse<00:02:40.959> he<00:02:41.290> doesn't<00:02:41.560> know

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
going well he's a horse he doesn't know

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.960 
going well he's a horse he doesn't know
he<00:02:41.769> doesn't<00:02:42.040> realize<00:02:42.310> what<00:02:42.340> he's<00:02:42.610> done<00:02:42.760> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
he doesn't realize what he's done this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.180 
he doesn't realize what he's done this
is<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.510> ploy<00:02:44.079> for<00:02:44.349> people<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.799> make<00:02:44.950> money

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
is just a ploy for people to make money

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.530 
is just a ploy for people to make money
so<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.579> find<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.849> interesting<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.299> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
so I find it interesting that the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.530 
so I find it interesting that the
climate<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.680> commentators<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.790> against

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
climate of the commentators is against

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.319 
climate of the commentators is against
the<00:02:49.690> tide<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.230> we're<00:02:50.620> seeing<00:02:51.340> largely<00:02:51.879> that

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
the tide that we're seeing largely that

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.869 
the tide that we're seeing largely that
you<00:02:53.049> know<00:02:53.170> animals<00:02:53.560> deserve<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.640> same<00:02:54.819> kind

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
you know animals deserve the same kind

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.670 
you know animals deserve the same kind
of<00:02:55.090> rights<00:02:55.359> as<00:02:55.569> humans<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.260> things<00:02:56.379> like<00:02:56.530> that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
of rights as humans and things like that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.979 
of rights as humans and things like that
now<00:02:57.400> I'm<00:02:57.489> not<00:02:57.640> saying<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.090> animals<00:02:58.660> don't

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
now I'm not saying that animals don't

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.839 
now I'm not saying that animals don't
deserve<00:02:59.349> you<00:02:59.950> know<00:02:59.980> their<00:03:00.250> space<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.549> all
