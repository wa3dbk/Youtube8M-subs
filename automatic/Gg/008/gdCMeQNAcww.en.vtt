00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.890
 hello to all and welcome to the bastille me it's the churches we are 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.889
 Friday, June 27 and here is your dose of a daybreak 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:12.959
 when 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.400
 retirement 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.830
 the ad on TV after 9 pm will soon hate us 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.530
 the ancient history indeed nicolas sarkozy announced last Wednesday the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.190
 suppression of advertising leggings from 21 hours to the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.270
 public television and proposed to make extensive use of 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.129
 Internet providers and telecom operators to finance the reform 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.140
 we actually work sarko wants to accelerate the removal of revenue 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.940
 advertising by taxing the turnover of the operators of 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.130
 telephony and internet up to 0 19% 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.770
 378 million euros in all according to the provinces it should intervene 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.910
 as of January 2013 that is to say 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.149
 just one year after the announcement of the reform project by our president 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.530
 born January 8 last so ok it's tantalizing to no longer see ads on 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.280
 evening 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.480
 but the counterpart 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.850
 as such 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.890
 whereas it is apparently illegal according to the French Federation of 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 telecoms 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.250
 the tax is counterproductive and will affect the customers that is to say no 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.659
 as usual wholesale we will have only one on the TV he will have to pay this 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.760

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.240
 vermeil since Wednesday used as the foot channel of the plane and it's towards 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.650
 destinations for now the number of devices allowing 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 flying connections to increase in the coming weeks 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.790

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.149
 edge between jfk airports from new york 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.479
 and the act of the year 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.700
 internet access was at first free but the company 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.350
 airline is about to collect nine and a half 99 euros to 12 95 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.070
 sometimes it happened that the service will be more generalized 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.880
 I find it cool of course to be able to chat blog from the plane 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.270
