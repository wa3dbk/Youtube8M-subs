scientific<00:01:19.650> approach<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.130> went<00:01:20.520> ahead<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
scientific approach I went ahead and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
scientific approach I went ahead and
looked<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> turns<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:22.320> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
looked into it and it turns out that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
looked into it and it turns out that
black<00:01:23.040> widow<00:01:23.340> spiders<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.210> venom<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
black widow spiders have venom that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350 
black widow spiders have venom that
inject<00:01:25.259> black<00:01:25.680> tro<00:01:25.950> toxins<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.640> cause<00:01:26.880> lack

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
inject black tro toxins that cause lack

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
inject black tro toxins that cause lack
dro<00:01:27.630> decked<00:01:27.960> ism<00:01:28.320> blacks<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.829> decked<00:01:29.009> ism<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
dro decked ism blacks are decked ism is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.980 
dro decked ism blacks are decked ism is
essentially<00:01:29.939> an<00:01:30.030> illness<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> its<00:01:30.689> effects

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
essentially an illness and its effects

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
essentially an illness and its effects
are<00:01:31.170> pain<00:01:31.500> rigid<00:01:32.070> muscles<00:01:32.220> vomiting<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
are pain rigid muscles vomiting and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
are pain rigid muscles vomiting and
sweating<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.200> idea<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> maybe<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
sweating so my idea is that maybe this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
sweating so my idea is that maybe this
perk<00:01:35.520> causes<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> zombies<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.810> experience

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
perk causes the zombies to experience

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.530 
perk causes the zombies to experience
these<00:01:37.740> effects<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.490> same<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> widow

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
these effects the same thing as a widow

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.410 
these effects the same thing as a widow
in<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.680> better<00:01:41.070> yet<00:01:41.280> maybe<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.820> melee

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
in some way or better yet maybe a melee

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
in some way or better yet maybe a melee
or<00:01:42.659> knife<00:01:43.530> attack<00:01:43.890> which<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.130> about<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
or knife attack which is about the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.249 
or knife attack which is about the
closest<00:01:44.909> thing<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> humans<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
closest thing that humans can get to a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
closest thing that humans can get to a
bite<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> maybe<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.460> causes<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> zombies

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
bite and maybe that causes the zombies

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.060 
bite and maybe that causes the zombies
to<00:01:48.390> temporarily<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.229> rigid<00:01:49.590> muscles<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
to temporarily get rigid muscles and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.230 
to temporarily get rigid muscles and
have<00:01:50.189> trouble<00:01:50.520> walking<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> things<00:01:51.119> like

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
have trouble walking and things like

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
have trouble walking and things like
that<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.960> post<00:01:52.290> also<00:01:52.590> tells<00:01:52.979> us<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that so this post also tells us that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.920 
that so this post also tells us that
some<00:01:53.790> harsh<00:01:54.030> cases<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.600> even<00:01:54.780> cause

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
some harsh cases can even cause

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 
some harsh cases can even cause
paralysis<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.310> these<00:01:56.430> things<00:01:56.670> are

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
paralysis so all of these things are

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
paralysis so all of these things are
possibilities<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.170> widows<00:01:58.619> wine<00:01:58.860> perk

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
possibilities for this widows wine perk

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.469 
possibilities for this widows wine perk
