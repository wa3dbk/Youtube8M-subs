00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.250
 lantern that will be perfect for 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 use in our Christmas celebration 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.040
 good as a centerpiece to decorate 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.539
 during lunch or dinner or for 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.520
 decorate the house any corner to which 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.400
 we want to give it a more magical air 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.820
 it's really easy to do and I hope 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 I wish you like it 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.130
 to make our Christmas lantern 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.810
 that will be perfect to use it from the center 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.370
 of table or ornament of our 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.230
 Christmas celebrations 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 We are going to need a glass jar 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.550
 which can be of this type or more 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.220
 squares are shorter than you have 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.960
 you for human house also a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 candle that can also be this type 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.950
 more planet or it can be the ones that are more 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.460
 tall and fatter 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.379
 a ribbon or red ribbon and fat salt 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.870
 as you can see the first thing we have 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.550
 fact has been to remove the lid we are going to 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.810
 remove it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.850
 then let's take the fat salt let's go 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.500
 to throw him in to leave to simulate 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.870
 what is honey 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.770
 we have been able to enclose a little snow 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.280
 and I have the magic of Christmas in 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.280
 a little pot 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.140
 the amount of fat salt will depend on what 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.510
 high we want to sail it if the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.759
 we want to place higher because we will 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.869
 a little bit more to visit us small 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.210
 that is going to see you 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.310
 then, as you can see, we would have thrown 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.720
 our little piece of snow with salt 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.369
 fat woman 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.180
 well, once we have our 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.119
 border already within our territory the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 tie and what we're going to do is decorate 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.650
 what would be the top part 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.710
 to give it that Christmas touch 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.050
 you do not know the red and the green are the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.110
 Main colors of Christmas 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.110
 why choose a tie of this color 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 it makes the result much more 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.820
 Christmas 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.820
 let's look around 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.530
 and we will make a loop at the end 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.840
 as you see we would have our tie 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.349
 fact 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 our snow inside and it would only be 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.730
 introduce our candle inside 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.220
 for later when the guests come 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.620
 turn it on and create one more aspect 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.840
 magical probably if you put a candle 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.540
 higher then it will remain as more 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.819
 romantic more Christmas 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.430
 Well, as you can see here 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.959
 we would have our lantern for 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.340
 decorate our Christmas celebrations 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.079
 and give everything a more magical atmosphere if 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.750
