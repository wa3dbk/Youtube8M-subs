we practice no-till farming which is
really<00:02:18.530> good<00:02:18.740> for<00:02:19.040> for<00:02:19.550> soil<00:02:20.120> erosion<00:02:20.690> control

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
really good for for soil erosion control

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.200 
really good for for soil erosion control
and<00:02:21.770> actually<00:02:22.070> will<00:02:22.310> add<00:02:22.430> moisture<00:02:22.670> back<00:02:23.180> into

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
and actually will add moisture back into

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.280 
and actually will add moisture back into
the<00:02:23.750> soil<00:02:23.960> as<00:02:24.260> well<00:02:25.360> we're<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.390> water-wise

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
the soil as well we're very water-wise

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.100 
the soil as well we're very water-wise
here<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.370> use<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.790> drip<00:02:29.030> irrigation<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.900> we

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
here we use the drip irrigation and we

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.560
