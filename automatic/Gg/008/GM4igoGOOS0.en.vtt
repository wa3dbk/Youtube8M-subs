00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
like this G sharp d sharp G sharp that's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.740 
like this G sharp d sharp G sharp that's
a<00:02:15.960> flat<00:02:16.290> E<00:02:16.470> flat<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.950> flat<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:18.540> gonna<00:02:18.630> go

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
a flat E flat a flat so it's gonna go

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.839 
a flat E flat a flat so it's gonna go
like<00:02:18.870> this

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.280 

that's<00:02:23.329> gonna<00:02:23.540> be<00:02:23.689> the<00:02:23.719> pattern<00:02:23.959> for<00:02:24.200> this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
that's gonna be the pattern for this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.370 
that's gonna be the pattern for this
whole<00:02:24.469> part<00:02:24.769> so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.720 

from<00:02:30.740> GD<00:02:31.490> sharp<00:02:31.790> G

so<00:02:41.440> if<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.650> notice<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.250> left<00:02:42.430> hand<00:02:42.700> has

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
so if you notice that the left hand has

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
so if you notice that the left hand has
the<00:02:42.970> same<00:02:43.300> rather<00:02:43.510> than<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.690> whole<00:02:43.840> time

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.110 

the<00:03:00.019> same<00:03:00.260> pattern<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.310> B<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.700> E<00:03:01.849> and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
the same pattern is just a B and E and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.670 
the same pattern is just a B and E and
you<00:03:02.300> do<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.510> twice

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.720 

and<00:03:06.159> on<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.580> doing<00:03:06.909> again

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
