as<00:00:28.390> you<00:00:28.660> know<00:00:28.840> Pluto<00:00:29.500> is<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.710> long<00:00:30.099> long<00:00:30.490> long

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
as you know Pluto is a long long long

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.299 
as you know Pluto is a long long long
way<00:00:31.240> away<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.869> so<00:00:32.559> we've<00:00:32.710> asked<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.129> friend

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
way away and so we've asked a friend

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.619 
way away and so we've asked a friend
planetary<00:00:34.239> friend<00:00:34.540> Jupiter<00:00:35.080> to<00:00:35.650> help<00:00:35.830> us<00:00:36.010> out

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
and we're getting ready to start the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.700 
and we're getting ready to start the
sequence<00:01:46.790> for<00:01:47.150> closest<00:01:47.540> approach<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
first event we're doing is we're going

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.780 
first event we're doing is we're going
to<00:01:50.270> Europa<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:51.800> what<00:01:52.160> we're<00:01:52.310> going<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.550> do<00:01:52.670> is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
to Europa so what we're going to do is

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.300 
to Europa so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:52.940> going<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.090> slough<00:01:53.450> off<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.860> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
we're going to slough off of the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.740 
we're going to slough off of the
high-gain<00:01:55.520> antenna<00:01:55.940> off<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.420> earth<00:01:56.540> and

high-gain antenna off of the earth and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.530 
high-gain antenna off of the earth and
start<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.260> put<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.680> imagers<00:01:58.430> on<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:59.240> various

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
start to put the imagers on the various

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.890 
start to put the imagers on the various
moons<00:01:59.840> of<00:02:00.080> jupiter<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.490> Jupiter<00:02:02.090> itself

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.870 

it's<00:02:05.900> very<00:02:06.170> scary<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:07.010> build<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.580> spacecraft

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's very scary to build a spacecraft

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's very scary to build a spacecraft
and<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:08.630> launch<00:02:08.930> it<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.710> don't<00:02:09.979> get<00:02:10.070> any

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
and then launch it and don't get any

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.000 
and then launch it and don't get any
data<00:02:10.640> over<00:02:10.910> nine<00:02:11.090> years<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.440> it's<00:02:12.710> really

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
data over nine years and so it's really

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.520 
data over nine years and so it's really
key<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:14.000> test<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.780> instruments<00:02:15.350> before

key to test out the instruments before

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.130 
key to test out the instruments before
we<00:02:15.980> get<00:02:16.490> there<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.880> we've<00:02:17.480> designed<00:02:17.720> this

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
we get there and we've designed this

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.710 
we get there and we've designed this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
and our sensitivity have been a very

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.850 
and our sensitivity have been a very

rapid learning process for all of us and
we<00:02:46.400> don't<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.730> very<00:02:46.760> much<00:02:47.000> time<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.420> do<00:02:47.570> that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
we don't have very much time to do that

we don't have very much time to do that
the<00:02:48.380> Jupiter<00:02:48.680> encounter<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.190> only<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.640> over

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the Jupiter encounter is only just over

the Jupiter encounter is only just over
a<00:02:50.090> year<00:02:50.180> after<00:02:50.690> launch<00:02:50.930> because<00:02:51.140> we're<00:02:51.380> going

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
a year after launch because we're going

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.130 
a year after launch because we're going
so<00:02:51.709> incredibly<00:02:52.220> fast<00:02:52.489> with<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.850> spacecraft

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
so incredibly fast with this spacecraft

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.940 
so incredibly fast with this spacecraft
so<00:02:54.140> we're<00:02:54.290> having<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.560> learn<00:02:54.709> these<00:02:54.890> things

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
so we're having to learn these things

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.690 
so we're having to learn these things
very<00:02:55.430> fast<00:02:55.600> definitely<00:02:56.600> not<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:56.870> boredom<00:02:57.700> it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
very fast definitely not in boredom it's

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.610 
very fast definitely not in boredom it's
been<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:58.940> sprinting<00:02:59.660> for<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.260> whole<00:03:00.590> year

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620

we're<00:03:01.310> ready<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:01.700> hibernation<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:02.330> think<00:03:02.540> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
we're ready for hibernation I think to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.720 
we're ready for hibernation I think to
slow<00:03:02.840> down<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.050> little<00:03:03.320> bit<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.370> been<00:03:04.519> fun

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
slow down a little bit so it's been fun

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.320 
slow down a little bit so it's been fun
and<00:03:05.000> kept<00:03:05.360> busy<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.100> always<00:03:07.250> rehearse<00:03:07.700> in

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330

approach to Jupiter we will be

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.339 
approach to Jupiter we will be
simultaneously<00:05:27.449> doing<00:05:27.659> science<00:05:28.139> and

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
simultaneously doing science and

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
the time we we have jupiter in our

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.820 
the time we we have jupiter in our
rearview<00:05:33.389> mirror<00:05:33.809> i<00:05:33.899> think<00:05:34.229> we'll<00:05:34.349> have<00:05:34.469> a<00:05:34.529> a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
rearview mirror i think we'll have a a

rearview mirror i think we'll have a a
really<00:05:35.610> great<00:05:35.759> understanding<00:05:36.120> of<00:05:36.479> how<00:05:36.569> this

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
really great understanding of how this

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.959 
really great understanding of how this
this<00:05:37.349> machine<00:05:37.680> works<00:05:37.949> and<00:05:38.370> how<00:05:38.639> we<00:05:38.699> work

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
this machine works and how we work

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.649 
this machine works and how we work
together<00:05:39.180> on<00:05:39.449> it<00:05:39.569> and<00:05:39.930> we'll<00:05:40.110> be<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:41.659> making

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
together on it and we'll be just making

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.059 
together on it and we'll be just making
sure<00:05:42.779> we<00:05:42.930> remember<00:05:43.169> all<00:05:43.349> that<00:05:43.469> for<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.860> next

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
sure we remember all that for the next

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.270 
sure we remember all that for the next
eight<00:05:44.189> years<00:05:44.219> until<00:05:44.729> we<00:05:44.849> get<00:05:44.969> to<00:05:45.059> Prudhoe
