00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.919
 good afternoon and good to see you again 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.200
 to dance from TV 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.150
 despite the heat I do is incredibly 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 their best at the workshops 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 mambo and experiment to be happy 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.920
 they put a little oil in the pool 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.920
 find 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.110
 i'm cool this is to jenner he 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.750
 we have mambo works this year 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.370
 yes very cool man what they really 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.100
 kids will be very cool with violence as a partner 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.620
 and then not really yes no yes but 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.250
 you may like it too but i feel 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.320
 actually 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.570
 we both have mom oh of course 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.150
 therefor an advantage for the older ones 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.900
 kids more difficult than for the young 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.730
 kit 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.590
 but i have to say it was anyway 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.390
 very much from a whole 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.910
 enthusiastic energy 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.920
 And then you are always proud of it 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 if they really like those kids and have fun 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.490
 they do well and they have the most 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.860
 lots of fun 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.899
 in the end i think our style goes 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.300
 of dancing because you are the two of you 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.979
 doing it is really fun together and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.670
 if you see that in they have it then 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.670
 mission accomplished 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.619
 I'm sitting here for a reason and reason 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.440
 just dance and have fun together 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.600
 and in beautiful surroundings and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.429
 and just yes you just know new ones too 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.509
 I think it's discovering a dance style 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.459
 most important 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.810
 I am skan then indicates space 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.209
 children to discover new things 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.119
 and I think so too for ours 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.619
 is always nice to be here 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.380
 give you every year naturally give one 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:53.959
 another workshop and then you see them 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:58.420
 You always see them blasting and yes 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:01.090
 say now I do understand 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.009
 well of course other dance anyway 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.200
 where did we teach in the same way 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.479
 and that gentleman how they teach is always 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.060
 very nice I just put it in myself 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.150
 the public or to the like there and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:19.900
 between the dan cs and after that is when 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:25.350
 with those with younger got my hand 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.350
 done yes food tasty yes 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.640
 my name is kate there too and i am 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.580
 dance teacher can experiment there 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.010
 actually a mishmash of all sorts 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.310
 dance styles my case i have a hip 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.920
 hop background and also likes how it works 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.709
 I have also done a lot of theater work 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.549
 in my case it is a combination of 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.500
 all rows of techniques but also whole 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.970
 a lot of theater expression and in particular 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.760
 the exaggerated saying expressions 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.180
 then you go to the screen mode which is 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.340
 jenny yes and then comes comparing 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.830
 we did really well 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.569
 I had I would have expected that 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.840
 they would be a little less good at Wickham 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.630
 was very positively surprised at how 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.760
 they were fast and not only that they were 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.440
 actually have their own contribution 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.100
 given that is always 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.060
 really a blessing for a teacher me 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.930
 work as 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.540
 execution dancing i also work as throwing 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.450
 cool theater make especially 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.489
 and of course I also work as a teacher and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.410
 because I am very young and I try too 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.730
 as many projects as possible 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.840
 that are very interesting 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.840
 of development
