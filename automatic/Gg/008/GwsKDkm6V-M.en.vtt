00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.380
 surely it is always always me 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 shark of the strait 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.480
 we say so anyway definitely been 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.940
 important to come here to see this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.830
 this final part of this one of this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 stop is because I did n't know this 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.500
 arrival is to say that surely the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.020
 feelings that day will be 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.990
 very different 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.520
 from today therefore more or less we are there 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.070
 get an idea of ​​how it will look like 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.640
 this climb and therefore maybe how 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.500
 being able to interpret it knowing how and the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.530
 hardest point of this climb that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.840
 hammer comes on top but let's say it is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.870
 displaced these two in two parts the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.600
 first part are long straights 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.040
 with what salt he knows for example about instead 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 then when you get to the lake this is it 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.970
 let's make this part flatter 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.260
 then to resume a final part 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.310
 that 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.860
 in pieces about 14 15 percent while a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 around now less than a month 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.260
 you're ready vincenzo still missing 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 a little bit surely we like how 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.830
 the team really prepared 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.360
 very well we have been a very internship 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.990
 long in tenerife 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.150
 so we came back now and still not 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.550
 i really know how i ever thought 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.930
 to be very well then in the next 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.570
 days we will go around Trentino 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.810
 so we can see how yellows 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.100
 general condition then only first 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.940
 of the word liegi baston liegi word 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.790
 so it lacks but the last thing a 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.650
 look at the starting grids of the tour 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.520
 most wiggins listed on this climb 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.990
 perhaps but surely these these 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.510
 climbs are very different from those of the 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.980
 tour and have slopes a little bit 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.690
 however, there have been more climbs 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.490
 we have seen details this morning 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.730
 Also the time trial of new wrist 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.620
 maybe it suits him better 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.220
 a wound rather like this maybe you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 higher in more 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.609
 life hard long re ass 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.959
 we say that it is not continuous and therefore 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.329
 safe also really e 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.159
 from tactical intelligence because the 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.890
 hardest piece maybe they are the last 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.870
 kilometers from the start and hard though there is 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.800
 a fake they have half goes as I said 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.830
 before later after gavia e 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.980
 and the stelvio clearly if the face 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.980
 over
