when you were being shot at you could
not<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.290> cheats<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:29.040> okay<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> guess<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
not put in cheats which okay I guess is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
not put in cheats which okay I guess is
realistic<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.840> realistic<00:01:31.320> pneus<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
realistic if realistic pneus is what you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
realistic if realistic pneus is what you
want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.820> good<00:01:33.090> because

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
want to go for then that's good because

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
want to go for then that's good because
who<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.170> real<00:01:34.560> life<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.040> able<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
who in real life would be able to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
who in real life would be able to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560 
navigate a cell phone menu while they're
taking<00:01:37.770> bullets<00:01:38.189> inside<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> their<00:01:39.090> bodies<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
taking bullets inside of their bodies I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
taking bullets inside of their bodies I
mean<00:01:39.780> okay<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.320> guess<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:41.070> not

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
mean okay I guess that's that's not

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
mean okay I guess that's that's not
gonna<00:01:41.310> happen<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.060> maybe<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> good

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
gonna happen so maybe that was a good

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.620 
gonna happen so maybe that was a good
thing<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.920> me<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> couldn't<00:01:45.420> stand

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
cheat wouldn't go and then you try it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
cheat wouldn't go and then you try it
again<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> find<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.170> you're
