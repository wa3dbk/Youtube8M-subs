00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and stick a chisel right in the glue on

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.620 
and stick a chisel right in the glue on
like<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:43.310> with<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.459> bevel<00:02:44.760> side<00:02:45.060> towards

like this with the bevel side towards
the<00:02:45.720> Chuck<00:02:46.500> we're<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.810> tap<00:02:48.810> that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the Chuck we're just going to tap that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.660 
the Chuck we're just going to tap that
lightly<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:52.380> we<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.950> take<00:02:53.610> that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
lightly really and now we can take that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.960 
lightly really and now we can take that
too<00:02:54.269> right<00:02:55.019> off<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.530> check<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:56.519> so

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.980 

and<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.740> our<00:03:02.770> finished<00:03:03.250> tray

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
and there we have our finished tray

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.680 
and there we have our finished tray
which<00:03:04.990> we<00:03:05.230> chucked<00:03:05.560> without<00:03:06.540> disturbing<00:03:07.540> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
which we chucked without disturbing a

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.080 
which we chucked without disturbing a
single<00:03:08.290> fiber<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:10.390> wood<00:03:11.580> using<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.730> same

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
single fiber of the wood using the same

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.010 
single fiber of the wood using the same
paper<00:03:14.050> joint<00:03:14.850> technique<00:03:15.850> we<00:03:16.300> can<00:03:16.480> glue<00:03:16.750> two

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
paper joint technique we can glue two

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.310 
paper joint technique we can glue two
halves<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.710> spindle<00:03:18.130> turning<00:03:18.520> together<00:03:18.730> and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
halves of a spindle turning together and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.230 
halves of a spindle turning together and
turn<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.560> turning<00:03:20.980> as<00:03:21.490> we<00:03:21.730> would<00:03:21.940> normally

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
turn the turning as we would normally

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.530 
turn the turning as we would normally
and<00:03:22.990> when<00:03:23.830> we're<00:03:24.010> all<00:03:24.160> finished<00:03:24.550> we<00:03:25.300> can

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and when we're all finished we can

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.440 
and when we're all finished we can
simply<00:03:25.960> take<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.820> put<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:27.850> down<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.150> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
simply take it and put it down on the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.980 
simply take it and put it down on the
bench<00:03:28.860> put<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.920> chisel<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.640> glue<00:03:30.910> line<00:03:31.360> like

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
bench put a chisel in the glue line like

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:42.900 
bench put a chisel in the glue line like
that<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:34.140> cap<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.170> with<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> hammer<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:42.070> we

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
that and cap it with a hammer and we

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.140 
that and cap it with a hammer and we
have<00:03:43.150> created<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:44.050> half<00:03:44.890> turning<00:03:45.490> or<00:03:45.670> often

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
have created a half turning or often

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.140 
have created a half turning or often
