00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.369
 special sediments i call queen 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.220

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 This is what I want to talk to about 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.329
 nutritionist salt before the pass you olga

 Hello 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.070
 actually what is different in the river 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.040
 from then all the cereals if they bow 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.250
 about the same but buckwheat in what 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.640
 better than others in it is less carbohydrates and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 there is in fact for the fact that in the river 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.170
 a lot of mussels she is good at cosmetic 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.320
 plan 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 because there are eg exfoliated nails 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.490
 break your voice something be a few days 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.560
 on the buckwheat diet know how that 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.770
 happens that is how much you need to eat 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.140
 for example 5-6 meals per day 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.010
 It get somewhere half a kilo of buckwheat in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 boiled 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.619
 and this day or two a week a week is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 Here is a good option to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.760
 feed your body din let's 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.960
 move on to our tasting area 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.659
 well what have we done here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 shredded buckwheat and I 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.250
 grains so much whole grain in the shell 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.870
 better first the shell itself 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 we need because she is the source 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.450
 vitamins of group b with and vitamins of group b 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.020
 need to have a power system with us 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.880
 was very strong without a group of vitamins 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.270
 b unfortunately our mood is not very 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.190
 good ones can even shed tears cry 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.900
 chronic fatigue syndrome can 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.000
 prompt to develop gradually and 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.940
 do you know such depression in the river 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.390
 initially a lot 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.180
 and on copper but we said speak 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.920
 really when cooking cereals and buckwheat 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.190
 loses a lot of good we are nutritionists 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.760
 love to teach people not to cook therefore its 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.210
 in the evening you can pour buckwheat over here with milk 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.520
 or kefir or yogurt extreme 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.500
 the case of water she married swell 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.930
 actually by morning the willingness to try 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 but buckwheat 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.760
 there are these black grains 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.160
 normally have not been afraid of standing on 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.550
 in fact it is the shell yurin they are useful 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.860
 black whom all get rid of it 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.050
 the flight is helpful do not know if the cereals 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.360
 peeled there are uncleaned ones here 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.480
 which are not cleaned they are useful and because 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.160
 that in the shells of cereal butterflies made 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.700
 there is a large amount of vitamins 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.240
 group b 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 notices in Russia are very fond of buckwheat 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.330
 The quality of the garnish with meat is normal with 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.460
 meat is better to eat vegetables and buckwheat 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.590
 refers to a landmark product to 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.500
 carbohydrate food more than that in it 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.320
 enough starch content therefore 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.720
 this combination is not the best buckwheat better 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.140
 only if the milk does not contain buckwheat 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360
 fat 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.950
 Naturally, it contains several 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.680
 about 12 percent a friend 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.470
 and the rest is carbohydrates here with 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.020
 microelements and vitamins so on and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.470
 milk is a product that is both fat and 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.560
 protein and carbohydrates in the form of lactose and very 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.380
 many vitamins fat soluble that's it 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.420
 the combination between them gives a very 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.269
 blanched breakfast offer to see 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.810
 to the letter of viewers kei 1 question from 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.790
 penza 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.489
 Victoria Dobrynina read in the journal 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.560
 that buckwheat contains substance Rusyns 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.970

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.910
 what is the moment of it is pp 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.550
 against him he is an iron good substance 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.590
 which is very good so to speak 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.800
 on the vascular wall in principle to all this 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.880
 shown especially to those who have 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.590
