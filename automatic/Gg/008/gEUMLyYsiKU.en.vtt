mod for minecraft anyway so the first
thing<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.769> we're<00:00:13.860> going

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:14.040> build<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.250> new<00:00:14.280> kind<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.670> pressure<00:00:14.969> plate<00:00:15.330> go

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to build a new kind of pressure plate go

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.710 
to build a new kind of pressure plate go
over<00:00:16.289> here<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> my<00:00:16.970> crafting<00:00:17.970> table<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.539> I'm

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
over here to my crafting table and I'm

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.120 
over here to my crafting table and I'm
going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> put<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.199> pressure<00:00:19.439> plates<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.920> top

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
going to put two pressure plates on top

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.920 
going to put two pressure plates on top
of<00:00:20.279> each<00:00:20.340> other<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> build

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
of each other and that's going to build

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.429 
of each other and that's going to build
a<00:00:22.080> safety<00:00:22.500> pressure<00:00:22.740> plate<00:00:24.050> now<00:00:25.050> what's<00:00:25.260> safe

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
a safety pressure plate now what's safe

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
a safety pressure plate now what's safe
about<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.769> well<00:00:26.760> what's<00:00:27.060> safe<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
about it well what's safe about it is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.990 
about it well what's safe about it is
that<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:28.080> can't<00:00:28.410> trigger<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.880> walk

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that I can't trigger this I can walk

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
that I can't trigger this I can walk
over<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.480> much<00:00:30.630> as<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.869> want<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> player

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
over it as much as I want as the player

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.360 
over it as much as I want as the player
I<00:00:32.189> cannot<00:00:32.489> trigger<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.739> pressure<00:00:34.739> plate<00:00:34.980> now

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
I cannot trigger the pressure plate now

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.270 
I cannot trigger the pressure plate now
if<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.520> had<00:00:38.700> some<00:00:38.940> sheep<00:00:39.809> around<00:00:41.899> bacon<00:00:42.899> Fred

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
if I had some sheep around bacon Fred

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.840 
if I had some sheep around bacon Fred
they<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.430> press<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> pressure<00:00:44.879> plate<00:00:46.850> all

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
they can press the pressure plate all

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.110 
they can press the pressure plate all
they<00:00:48.090> want<00:00:49.670> except<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> looks<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.000> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
they want except it looks like they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:04.429 
they want except it looks like they
don't<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:52.010> stop<00:00:53.010> staring<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.610> me<00:01:03.439> there

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
don't want to stop staring at me there

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.510 
don't want to stop staring at me there
we<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:05.630> as<00:01:06.630> long<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.049> step<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
we go as long as they step on it the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
we go as long as they step on it the
pressure<00:01:08.729> plate<00:01:08.909> extends<00:01:12.350> now<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> great

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
pressure plate extends now this is great

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.100 
pressure plate extends now this is great
for<00:01:13.860> building<00:01:14.100> traps<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.780> use<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
for building traps we can use some of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
for building traps we can use some of
the<00:01:16.259> other<00:01:16.380> blocks<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.250> aberrant

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the other blocks that are in aberrant

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.440 
the other blocks that are in aberrant
tools<00:01:19.250> like<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.280> lightening<00:01:20.759> block<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
tools like the lightening block or the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.469 
tools like the lightening block or the
fire<00:01:21.840> block<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.030> example<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
fire block and I have an example of that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.670 
fire block and I have an example of that
over<00:01:24.750> here

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.990 

we<00:01:32.680> have<00:01:32.829> these<00:01:33.009> lightning<00:01:33.250> blocks<00:01:33.640> and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
we have these lightning blocks and

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.450 
we have these lightning blocks and
they're<00:01:34.119> surrounded<00:01:34.600> by<00:01:34.860> safety<00:01:35.860> plates<00:01:36.130> and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
they're surrounded by safety plates and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.319 
they're surrounded by safety plates and
I<00:01:36.939> am<00:01:37.090> not<00:01:37.270> in<00:01:37.390> fact<00:01:37.570> electrocuting<00:01:38.229> myself<00:01:38.350> ya

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.840 

see<00:01:43.329> let's<00:01:43.539> throw<00:01:43.719> a<00:01:43.780> couple<00:01:43.960> enemies<00:01:44.350> down

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
see let's throw a couple enemies down

00:01:44.850 --> 00:02:07.499 
see let's throw a couple enemies down
oops<00:01:45.850> I'm<00:01:46.119> in<00:01:46.270> peaceful<00:01:46.600> mode<00:02:06.209> so<00:02:07.209> that<00:02:07.240> works

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
oops I'm in peaceful mode so that works

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.120 
oops I'm in peaceful mode so that works
pretty<00:02:07.659> well<00:02:07.810> based<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.619> on<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.920> trap

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
pretty well based up on the trap

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.259 
pretty well based up on the trap
lightning<00:02:12.130> comes<00:02:12.310> down<00:02:12.519> from<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.790> sky<00:02:13.000> and

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
lightning comes down from the sky and

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:38.679 
lightning comes down from the sky and
they<00:02:13.750> die<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:19.750> see<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.019> one<00:02:20.140> more<00:02:20.170> time

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.610 

of<00:02:39.689> course<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.019> works<00:02:40.140> better<00:02:40.319> when<00:02:40.469> you're

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of course it works better when you're

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.059 
of course it works better when you're
not<00:02:40.709> placing<00:02:41.069> them<00:02:41.159> yourself<00:02:41.549> but<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.950> get

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
not placing them yourself but you get

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.490 
not placing them yourself but you get
the<00:02:44.129> idea<00:02:47.629> so<00:02:48.629> we<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.930> one<00:02:49.109> more<00:02:49.260> block

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the idea so we have one more block

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.879 
the idea so we have one more block
that's<00:02:50.340> new<00:02:50.639> in<00:02:50.849> 08<00:02:54.530> I'll<00:02:55.530> go<00:02:55.680> back<00:02:55.829> over<00:02:56.189> to<00:02:56.370> my

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
that's new in 08 I'll go back over to my

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.649 
that's new in 08 I'll go back over to my
sheep<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.099> festive<00:03:00.560> area<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.790> use<00:03:03.569> the

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
sheep and festive area and use the

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.869 
sheep and festive area and use the
crafting<00:03:03.989> table<00:03:04.250> make<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> put<00:03:05.489> three<00:03:05.669> dirt

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
crafting table make a put three dirt

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:14.179 
crafting table make a put three dirt
down<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:09.019> three<00:03:10.019> sand<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.709> get<00:03:13.889> a<00:03:13.919> tower

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
down and three sand and we get a tower

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:23.990 
down and three sand and we get a tower
block<00:03:21.709> now<00:03:22.709> it's<00:03:22.950> important<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.489> find<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.849> nice

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
block now it's important to find a nice

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.959 
block now it's important to find a nice
hole<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.540> stick<00:03:24.629> your<00:03:24.900> tower<00:03:25.139> block<00:03:25.439> in<00:03:25.849> so<00:03:26.849> it

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:26.969 
hole to stick your tower block in so it

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.420 
hole to stick your tower block in so it
knows<00:03:27.150> where<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.389> build<00:03:27.629> from<00:03:28.129> so<00:03:29.129> put<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
knows where to build from so put that

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.059 
knows where to build from so put that
right<00:03:29.639> there<00:03:29.989> drop<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> little<00:03:31.229> red<00:03:31.470> stone<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
right there drop a little red stone and

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.539 
right there drop a little red stone and
switch<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:34.379> when<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> flip<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.919> switch<00:03:36.530> tower

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
switch and when I flip the switch tower

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.129 
switch and when I flip the switch tower
it<00:03:38.549> just<00:03:38.819> built<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.090> cobblestone<00:03:39.389> tower<00:03:39.780> around

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
it just built a cobblestone tower around

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.309 
it just built a cobblestone tower around
us<00:03:40.290> flip<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.250> switch<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.669> goes<00:03:41.819> away<00:03:43.849> tower<00:03:45.319> no

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
us flip the switch it goes away tower no

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.750 
us flip the switch it goes away tower no
tower<00:03:46.760> tower<00:03:48.260> no<00:03:49.260> tower<00:03:49.639> we<00:03:50.639> have

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
tower tower no tower we have

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.369 
tower tower no tower we have
configuration<00:03:51.419> for<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.689> stuff<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.199> hold

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
configuration for this stuff we hold

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.819 
configuration for this stuff we hold
down<00:03:52.560> tab<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.159> right<00:03:53.340> click<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.650> say

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
down tab and right click we can say

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.030 
down tab and right click we can say
built<00:03:56.069> ceiling<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:57.359> can<00:03:57.509> say<00:03:57.659> make<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.019> shorter

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.550 

or<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.340> guess<00:04:03.520> I<00:04:03.610> change<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.940> length<00:04:04.120> didn't<00:04:04.450> I

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
or I guess I change the length didn't I

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.450 
or I guess I change the length didn't I
now<00:04:05.560> look<00:04:05.710> at<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.010> change<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.280> length

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
now look at that it change the length

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.160 
now look at that it change the length
well<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:07.120> can<00:04:07.300> change<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.720> length<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
well you can change the length and the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.640 
well you can change the length and the
height<00:04:10.620> let's<00:04:11.620> turn<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:11.980> off<00:04:12.070> first<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:13.650> make

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
height let's turn it off first and make

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.760 
height let's turn it off first and make
some<00:04:14.800> changes

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.290 

we<00:04:23.340> make<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.550> smaller<00:04:23.819> tower<00:04:25.940> we<00:04:26.940> can<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.270> fact

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
we make a smaller tower we can in fact

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.909 
we make a smaller tower we can in fact
change<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.960> block<00:04:28.169> type<00:04:28.379> so<00:04:28.560> I've<00:04:28.620> got<00:04:28.770> some

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
change the block type so I've got some

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.040 
change the block type so I've got some
glowstone<00:04:29.340> here<00:04:29.639> I'll<00:04:30.629> make<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.930> out<00:04:31.020> of

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
glowstone here I'll make it out of

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.619 
glowstone here I'll make it out of
glowstone<00:04:31.639> make<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.789> big<00:04:32.970> again<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.479> we<00:04:33.539> have

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
glowstone make it big again and we have

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.200 
glowstone make it big again and we have
different<00:04:33.930> shapes<00:04:34.190> we<00:04:35.190> can<00:04:35.310> use<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> diamond<00:04:35.940> or

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
different shapes we can use a diamond or

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.290 
different shapes we can use a diamond or
a<00:04:36.810> pentagon<00:04:37.520> let's<00:04:38.520> make<00:04:38.699> a<00:04:38.729> 10<00:04:38.940> by<00:04:39.090> 10

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
a pentagon let's make a 10 by 10

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.529 
a pentagon let's make a 10 by 10
Pentagon<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:39.960> glowstone<00:04:41.150> pink<00:04:42.680> there<00:04:43.680> we<00:04:43.770> go

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
Pentagon on a glowstone pink there we go

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.640 
Pentagon on a glowstone pink there we go
you'll<00:04:45.539> notice<00:04:45.840> there<00:04:46.020> are<00:04:46.110> some<00:04:46.319> holes<00:04:46.470> in

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you'll notice there are some holes in

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.369 
you'll notice there are some holes in
the<00:04:46.710> ceiling<00:04:46.860> I'm<00:04:47.310> still<00:04:47.639> working<00:04:47.669> on<00:04:48.030> the

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
the ceiling I'm still working on the

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.990 
the ceiling I'm still working on the
polygon<00:04:49.379> contraction<00:04:50.009> algorithm<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.699> fills

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
polygon contraction algorithm that fills

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.409 
polygon contraction algorithm that fills
in<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.240> top<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.699> think<00:04:53.699> this<00:04:53.819> is<00:04:54.000> aliasing

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
in the top I think this is aliasing

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.689 
in the top I think this is aliasing
which<00:04:55.349> means<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:55.979> might<00:04:56.130> or<00:04:56.280> might<00:04:56.310> not<00:04:56.460> be

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
which means it might or might not be

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.309 
which means it might or might not be
easy<00:04:56.819> to<00:04:57.030> fix<00:04:57.180> but<00:04:57.419> anyways<00:04:57.690> it's<00:04:58.139> still

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
easy to fix but anyways it's still

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.469 
easy to fix but anyways it's still
significantly<00:04:58.889> better<00:04:59.130> than<00:04:59.370> having<00:05:00.300> to

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
significantly better than having to

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.570 
significantly better than having to
build<00:05:00.569> the<00:05:00.720> entire<00:05:00.930> tower<00:05:01.199> yourself<00:05:01.710> now<00:05:02.400> if

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
build the entire tower yourself now if

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.159 
build the entire tower yourself now if
if<00:05:02.819> you<00:05:03.060> like<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.360> tower<00:05:03.569> where<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:03.990> you

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
if you like this tower where it is you

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.320 
if you like this tower where it is you
can<00:05:04.319> just<00:05:04.530> break<00:05:05.159> this<00:05:05.370> block<00:05:05.699> and<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.150> tower

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
can just break this block and the tower

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.480 
can just break this block and the tower
will<00:05:06.539> stay<00:05:06.810> there<00:05:07.130> otherwise<00:05:08.130> if<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:08.340> turn

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
will stay there otherwise if you turn

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.170 
will stay there otherwise if you turn
the<00:05:08.580> power<00:05:08.699> off<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.960> goes<00:05:09.990> away<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.880> we<00:05:14.969> can<00:05:15.090> of

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
the power off it goes away and we can of

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.240 
the power off it goes away and we can of
course<00:05:15.330> make<00:05:15.479> these<00:05:15.690> really<00:05:16.020> big<00:05:16.319> let's<00:05:17.069> start

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
course make these really big let's start

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.290 
course make these really big let's start
at<00:05:17.340> 25<00:05:17.669> by<00:05:17.819> 25<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.630> we<00:05:18.690> can<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:19.940> just<00:05:20.940> about<00:05:21.060> as

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
at 25 by 25 and we can go just about as

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.809 
at 25 by 25 and we can go just about as
big<00:05:21.449> as<00:05:21.479> you<00:05:21.719> can<00:05:21.870> possibly<00:05:22.050> want<00:05:22.560> but<00:05:23.069> I<00:05:23.340> warn

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
big as you can possibly want but I warn

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.279 
big as you can possibly want but I warn
you<00:05:23.909> the<00:05:24.330> bigger<00:05:24.509> you<00:05:24.690> make<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.110> more

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
you the bigger you make it the more

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.719 
you the bigger you make it the more
likely<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:26.610> are<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.759> get<00:05:26.940> lag<00:05:28.520> which<00:05:29.520> I'm

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
likely you are to get lag which I'm

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.670 
likely you are to get lag which I'm
going<00:05:29.819> to<00:05:29.909> keep<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.150> with<00:05:30.300> low<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:31.440> show<00:05:31.469> you

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
going to keep the with low to show you

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.600 
going to keep the with low to show you
the<00:05:31.830> oblong<00:05:36.800> ya<00:05:37.800> seem<00:05:38.039> a<00:05:38.130> dilute<00:05:38.370> we<00:05:38.490> had<00:05:38.580> a

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
the oblong ya seem a dilute we had a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.760 
the oblong ya seem a dilute we had a
little<00:05:38.789> lag<00:05:39.000> there<00:05:39.270> but<00:05:39.479> this<00:05:39.599> is<00:05:39.840> well<00:05:40.590> it's

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
little lag there but this is well it's

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.240 
little lag there but this is well it's
ginormous<00:05:42.289> it's<00:05:43.289> just<00:05:43.940> ridiculously<00:05:44.940> huge

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
ginormous it's just ridiculously huge

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.999 
ginormous it's just ridiculously huge
now<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.310> notice<00:05:47.550> this<00:05:47.819> follows<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.360> rules<00:05:48.599> of

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
now you notice this follows the rules of

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.189 
now you notice this follows the rules of
the<00:05:50.009> tower<00:05:50.219> builder<00:05:50.669> item<00:05:51.029> in<00:05:51.690> which<00:05:51.840> case<00:05:52.050> it

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
the tower builder item in which case it

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.320 
the tower builder item in which case it
does<00:05:52.380> not<00:05:52.620> replace<00:05:53.009> box<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.669> only<00:05:53.789> fills<00:05:54.150> in

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
does not replace box it only fills in

does not replace box it only fills in
areas<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:55.440> as<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.650> can<00:05:55.770> see<00:05:55.949> we<00:05:56.130> didn't

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
areas so as you can see we didn't

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.820 
areas so as you can see we didn't
destroy<00:05:57.300> our<00:05:57.479> little<00:05:57.779> repeater<00:05:58.139> here<00:05:58.229> or<00:05:58.650> any

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
destroy our little repeater here or any

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.050 
destroy our little repeater here or any
of<00:05:58.919> this<00:05:59.009> redstone<00:05:59.400> that<00:05:59.669> happened<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.000> be

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
of this redstone that happened to be

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.189 
of this redstone that happened to be
there<00:06:01.639> one<00:06:02.639> exception<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.180> snow<00:06:03.419> I<00:06:03.690> hate<00:06:03.930> snow

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
there one exception is snow I hate snow

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.379 
there one exception is snow I hate snow
snow<00:06:04.949> is<00:06:05.009> getting<00:06:05.190> replaced<00:06:05.639> pretty<00:06:06.270> much

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
snow is getting replaced pretty much

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:12.540 
snow is getting replaced pretty much
every<00:06:06.659> time

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.890 

yeah<00:06:13.210> there's<00:06:13.510> a<00:06:13.570> little<00:06:13.840> leg<00:06:15.660> but<00:06:16.660> there's<00:06:16.810> a

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
yeah there's a little leg but there's a

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.740 
yeah there's a little leg but there's a
huge<00:06:17.080> amount<00:06:17.140> of<00:06:17.320> blocks<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:19.360> probably<00:06:19.600> don't

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
huge amount of blocks you probably don't

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.830 
huge amount of blocks you probably don't
want<00:06:21.780> where<00:06:22.780> we<00:06:22.900> have<00:06:23.080> 50<00:06:23.890> by<00:06:24.040> 50<00:06:24.100> x<00:06:24.490> 24<00:06:25.030> that's

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
want where we have 50 by 50 x 24 that's

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.920 
want where we have 50 by 50 x 24 that's
why<00:06:25.960> the<00:06:26.020> max<00:06:26.260> goes<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.590> 25<00:06:26.950> by<00:06:27.100> 25<00:06:27.160> by<00:06:27.640> 25<00:06:27.930> you

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
why the max goes to 25 by 25 by 25 you

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.630 
why the max goes to 25 by 25 by 25 you
should<00:06:29.080> probably<00:06:29.230> have<00:06:29.560> no<00:06:29.710> problem<00:06:30.070> with<00:06:30.430> lag

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
should probably have no problem with lag

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.660 
should probably have no problem with lag
little<00:06:31.300> tip<00:06:31.420> really<00:06:31.660> slow<00:06:31.840> system<00:06:32.580> so<00:06:33.580> we've

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
little tip really slow system so we've

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.240 
little tip really slow system so we've
got<00:06:33.850> hexagon<00:06:34.330> heptagon<00:06:35.010> what's<00:06:36.010> a<00:06:36.100> heptagon

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
got hexagon heptagon what's a heptagon

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.430 
got hexagon heptagon what's a heptagon
go<00:06:37.210> look<00:06:37.360> it<00:06:37.450> up<00:06:38.160> octagon<00:06:39.570> decagon<00:06:40.570> dodecagon

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
go look it up octagon decagon dodecagon

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.250 
go look it up octagon decagon dodecagon
and<00:06:41.890> then<00:06:42.640> circle<00:06:43.060> and<00:06:43.270> of<00:06:43.450> course<00:06:43.660> it's

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
and then circle and of course it's

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.920 
and then circle and of course it's
really<00:06:44.500> not<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.800> circle<00:06:45.660> because<00:06:46.660> this<00:06:46.810> is

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
really not a circle because this is

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.990 
really not a circle because this is
minecraft<00:06:47.380> and<00:06:47.620> there's<00:06:48.130> no<00:06:48.370> real<00:06:48.520> circles<00:06:48.910> in

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
minecraft and there's no real circles in

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.300 
minecraft and there's no real circles in
Minecraft<00:06:49.420> but<00:06:49.660> it's<00:06:50.530> about<00:06:50.800> as<00:06:50.920> close<00:06:51.070> as<00:06:51.220> I

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
Minecraft but it's about as close as I

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.530 
Minecraft but it's about as close as I
can<00:06:51.370> get<00:06:52.710> once<00:06:53.710> again<00:06:53.830> we're<00:06:54.070> oblong<00:06:54.490> and<00:06:54.760> so

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
can get once again we're oblong and so

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.090 
can get once again we're oblong and so
we've<00:06:55.690> got<00:06:55.720> more<00:06:56.020> of<00:06:56.080> an<00:06:56.230> oval<00:06:56.380> shape<00:06:56.560> than<00:06:57.010> a

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
we've got more of an oval shape than a

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.910 
we've got more of an oval shape than a
circle<00:06:57.400> shape

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:15.390 

and<00:07:04.580> once<00:07:04.790> again<00:07:04.880> it's<00:07:05.120> two<00:07:06.050> huge

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.650 

as<00:07:15.940> it<00:07:16.180> deletes<00:07:16.449> all<00:07:16.570> of<00:07:16.720> those<00:07:16.810> there<00:07:17.470> we<00:07:17.560> go

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
as it deletes all of those there we go

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.749 
as it deletes all of those there we go
but<00:07:19.660> certainly<00:07:20.110> more<00:07:20.500> sensible<00:07:20.979> sizes<00:07:23.759> just

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 
but certainly more sensible sizes just

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.870 
but certainly more sensible sizes just
kind<00:07:24.910> of<00:07:24.970> appear<00:07:25.330> and<00:07:26.199> disappear<00:07:26.370> no<00:07:27.370> problem

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.850 

you<00:07:30.880> can<00:07:31.060> even<00:07:33.780> see<00:07:34.780> we<00:07:35.169> have<00:07:35.259> a<00:07:35.289> no<00:07:35.410> even<00:07:35.770> of

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
you can even see we have a no even of

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.090 
you can even see we have a no even of
triangle<00:07:38.880> it's<00:07:39.880> a<00:07:39.970> triangle<00:07:40.770> it's<00:07:41.770> a<00:07:41.860> happy

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
triangle it's a triangle it's a happy

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.240 
triangle it's a triangle it's a happy
little<00:07:42.220> triangle<00:07:45.360> anyway<00:07:46.360> so<00:07:46.419> that's<00:07:46.600> it

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.250 
little triangle anyway so that's it

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.040 
little triangle anyway so that's it
those<00:07:48.250> are<00:07:48.400> the<00:07:48.430> two<00:07:48.610> new<00:07:48.729> blocks<00:07:49.050> available
