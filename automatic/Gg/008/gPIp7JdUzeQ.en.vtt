hey<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.610> package<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.450> package<00:04:32.630> says<00:04:33.110> that

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
hey the package the package says that

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.820 
hey the package the package says that
these<00:04:33.650> are<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.979> best<00:04:34.280> value<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.200> I<00:04:36.200> would<00:04:36.590> only

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
these are the best value so I would only

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.310 
these are the best value so I would only
assume<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.220> they<00:04:37.760> are<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.180> best<00:04:38.210> value<00:04:38.840> and

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
assume that they are the best value and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.370 
assume that they are the best value and
plus<00:04:39.770> they<00:04:40.340> were<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.669> clearance<00:04:41.120> which<00:04:42.110> makes

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
plus they were on clearance which makes

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.250 
plus they were on clearance which makes
the<00:04:42.560> best<00:04:42.740> value<00:04:43.190> even<00:04:43.580> better<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.870> next

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
the best value even better and the next

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.620 
the best value even better and the next

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.870 
before it's so simple it's so ingenious
it<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:02.380> probably<00:06:03.380> already<00:06:04.340> been<00:06:04.490> thought<00:06:04.700> of

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
it is probably already been thought of

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.910 
it is probably already been thought of
and<00:06:05.150> somebody<00:06:05.540> had<00:06:06.020> some<00:06:06.320> sort<00:06:06.530> of<00:06:06.620> failure

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
and somebody had some sort of failure

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.580 
and somebody had some sort of failure
with<00:06:07.310> it<00:06:07.490> because<00:06:07.820> why<00:06:08.660> wouldn't<00:06:09.170> you<00:06:09.380> have

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
with it because why wouldn't you have

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.800 
with it because why wouldn't you have
that<00:06:09.860> this<00:06:10.850> happen<00:06:11.150> all<00:06:11.210> those<00:06:11.330> moments<00:06:11.690> it's

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
that this happen all those moments it's

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.780 
that this happen all those moments it's
actually<00:06:12.110> so<00:06:12.350> good<00:06:12.380> that<00:06:13.340> I'm<00:06:13.430> not<00:06:13.580> gonna<00:06:13.700> tell

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
actually so good that I'm not gonna tell

actually so good that I'm not gonna tell
you<00:06:14.090> what<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.360> idea<00:06:14.690> was<00:06:14.930> because<00:06:15.170> if<00:06:15.470> you

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
you what the idea was because if you

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.400 
you what the idea was because if you
guys<00:06:15.800> are<00:06:16.750> technologically<00:06:17.750> advanced<00:06:18.200> in<00:06:18.290> any

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
guys are technologically advanced in any
