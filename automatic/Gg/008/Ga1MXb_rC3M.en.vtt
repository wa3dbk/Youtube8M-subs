catch it did that a few times and if

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.400 
catch it did that a few times and if
you're<00:02:28.710> ready<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> next<00:02:30.060> part

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
you're ready you go on to the next part

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
you're ready you go on to the next part
which<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.440> spin<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.280> landing<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:33.000> finger

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
which is spin it landing on your finger

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.860 
which is spin it landing on your finger
now<00:02:34.400> spin<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.520> landed<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.210> bring<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.660> out

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
now spin it landed on here bring it out

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.710 
now spin it landed on here bring it out
so<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:38.460> takes<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.790> lot<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.940> practice

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so it takes a lot of practice

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.290 
so it takes a lot of practice
but<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.620> think<00:02:40.830> gets<00:02:41.100> practice<00:02:41.490> like<00:02:41.610> four<00:02:42.150> or

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
but you think gets practice like four or

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.830 
but you think gets practice like four or
five<00:02:42.330> hours<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.900> day<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.530> really<00:02:43.650> up<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.520> this

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
five hours a day but really up I do this

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.960 
five hours a day but really up I do this
I'd<00:02:45.840> say<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> whole<00:02:46.860> week<00:02:47.040> ten<00:02:47.550> minutes<00:02:47.880> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I'd say for a whole week ten minutes a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
I'd say for a whole week ten minutes a
day<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> whole<00:02:48.510> week<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.830> being<00:02:50.130> Bank

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
day for a whole week so just being Bank

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.520 
day for a whole week so just being Bank
assist<00:02:50.790> them<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.060> your<00:02:51.150> practice<00:02:51.660> will<00:02:52.380> go<00:02:52.500> a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
assist them in your practice will go a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.940 
assist them in your practice will go a
long<00:02:52.800> way<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:55.050> much<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.560> good<00:02:55.709> spin

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
long way so much you have a good spin

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.850 
long way so much you have a good spin
and<00:02:56.340> know<00:02:56.640> how<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.880> spin<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> ball<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:58.709> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and know how to spin the ball then you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.949 
and know how to spin the ball then you
can<00:02:59.040> knowledge<00:02:59.459> them<00:02:59.640> to<00:03:00.150> do<00:03:00.300> around<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
can knowledge them to do around the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.160 
can knowledge them to do around the
world<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:02.090> good<00:03:03.090> point<00:03:03.360> would<00:03:03.630> be<00:03:05.540> focus<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
world a good point would be focus on the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.570 
world a good point would be focus on the
ball<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.720> trying<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.959> balance<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.470> ball<00:03:10.620> at

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
ball and trying to balance the ball at

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.340 
ball and trying to balance the ball at
all<00:03:11.850> up<00:03:12.150> at<00:03:12.420> all<00:03:12.540> times<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.989> your<00:03:13.020> mind

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
all up at all times in your mind

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.330 
all up at all times in your mind
focusing<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.989> having<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.110> mindset<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:17.280> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
focusing and having that mindset so I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.690 
focusing and having that mindset so I
would<00:03:17.520> focus<00:03:18.590> always<00:03:19.590> trying<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.950> balance<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
would focus always trying to balance the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.140 
would focus always trying to balance the
ball<00:03:21.830> just<00:03:22.830> trying<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.190> let<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.700> stay<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:23.970> my

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
ball just trying to let it stay on my

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.620 
ball just trying to let it stay on my
finger<00:03:24.420> attempting<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> trip<00:03:26.390> another<00:03:27.390> good

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
finger attempting the trip another good

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.350 
finger attempting the trip another good
point<00:03:27.810> because<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.950> trip<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.519> takes

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
point because to do the trip it takes

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.850 
point because to do the trip it takes
more<00:03:30.540> than<00:03:30.600> balance<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.410> takes<00:03:31.620> some

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
more than balance it takes some

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.400 
more than balance it takes some
technique<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> first<00:03:33.510> time<00:03:33.810> doing<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
technique for the first time doing the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.720 
technique for the first time doing the
jerk<00:03:34.620> okay

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
jerk okay

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.449 
jerk okay
so<00:03:36.090> there's<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.200> good<00:03:37.380> technique<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.920> want<00:03:38.340> you

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
so there's a good technique I want you

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.580 
so there's a good technique I want you
guys<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:39.019> bend<00:03:40.019> over<00:03:40.580> but<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.670> like<00:03:41.880> that

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
guys to bend over but not like that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.970 
guys to bend over but not like that
you<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.190> will<00:03:44.340> do<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.580> trick<00:03:44.730> thing<00:03:45.060> over<00:03:45.510> so

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
you you will do the trick thing over so

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.979 
you you will do the trick thing over so
you'll<00:03:46.980> bounce<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.459> ball<00:03:47.640> spinning<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
you'll bounce the ball spinning it and

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.039 
you'll bounce the ball spinning it and
then<00:03:49.590> bend<00:03:50.160> over<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.660> ball<00:03:52.019> is

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
then bend over so now the ball is

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.920 
then bend over so now the ball is
underneath<00:03:52.560> you're<00:03:53.130> under<00:03:53.459> pitch<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.720> now<00:03:54.870> you

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
underneath you're under pitch so now you

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.890 
underneath you're under pitch so now you
have<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.260> space<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:57.299> what<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.750> want

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
have that space and then what you want

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900 
have that space and then what you want
to<00:03:57.959> do<00:03:58.080> by<00:03:58.500> balancing<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.340> want<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.580> try<00:03:59.760> and

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
to do by balancing you want to try and

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.370 
to do by balancing you want to try and
see<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.239> can<00:04:00.360> put<00:04:00.480> all<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.930> way<00:04:01.049> up<00:04:01.170> there

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
see if you can put all the way up there

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.500 
see if you can put all the way up there
and<00:04:01.680> then<00:04:02.610> since<00:04:02.910> it's<00:04:03.090> all<00:04:03.209> over<00:04:03.390> out<00:04:03.480> there

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and then since it's all over out there

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.920 
and then since it's all over out there
now<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.470> go<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:05.489> let's<00:04:06.450> try<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.660> again

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
now you can go up let's try this again

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.800 
now you can go up let's try this again
spin<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.830> ball<00:04:08.239> bend<00:04:09.239> over

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
spin the ball bend over

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.949 
spin the ball bend over
now<00:04:10.230> that's<00:04:10.380> under<00:04:10.590> your<00:04:10.739> under<00:04:10.950> pick<00:04:11.299> now<00:04:12.299> try

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
now that's under your under pick now try

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.190 
now that's under your under pick now try
to<00:04:12.989> get<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.530> out<00:04:13.680> there<00:04:13.920> by<00:04:14.070> balancing<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:15.200> as

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
to get it out there by balancing and as

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
to get it out there by balancing and as
you<00:04:16.410> walk<00:04:16.620> with<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:17.100> that's<00:04:17.910> all<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> is

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
you walk with it that's all it is

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.320 
you walk with it that's all it is
what's<00:04:19.640> up<00:04:19.820> spin<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> ball<00:04:21.430> bend<00:04:22.430> over<00:04:22.880> it's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
what's up spin the ball bend over it's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.690 
what's up spin the ball bend over it's
under<00:04:23.660> your<00:04:23.810> hunger<00:04:24.080> pit<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:26.050> go<00:04:27.050> up<00:04:27.700> again
