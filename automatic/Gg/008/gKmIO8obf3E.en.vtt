00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
night out at the track I think if you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.999 
night out at the track I think if you
look<00:01:39.700> at<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.810> crowd<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.619> goes<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
look at the crowd that goes to the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.859 
look at the crowd that goes to the
Kentucky<00:01:42.310> Derby<00:01:42.789> or<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.060> Preakness<00:01:43.569> or<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
Kentucky Derby or the Preakness or the

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.139 
Kentucky Derby or the Preakness or the
Belmont<00:01:44.259> Stakes<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.890> think<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.939> should<00:01:46.090> be

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
Belmont Stakes I think that it should be

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.639 
Belmont Stakes I think that it should be
like<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.569> I'm<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.079> weekends<00:01:47.499> you<00:01:47.619> know

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.499 
like that I'm the weekends you know
you'd<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.189> see<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.460> all<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.609> time<00:01:48.729> but<00:01:49.270> I

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
you'd like to see it all the time but I

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.899 
you'd like to see it all the time but I
think<00:01:49.960> if<00:01:50.079> you<00:01:50.200> go<00:01:50.229> back<00:01:50.499> to<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:51.100> know<00:01:51.399> way<00:01:51.700> back
