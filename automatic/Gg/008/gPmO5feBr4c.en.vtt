a month ago and I think it was someone
should<00:00:52.130> just<00:00:52.160> posting<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.790> like<00:00:52.940> something

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.420 
they'd made like a new block type and I
think<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.140> guys<00:00:57.290> who<00:00:57.590> make<00:00:57.950> minecraft

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.639 
pretty easy i mean all you gotta do is
take<00:01:32.179> out<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.479> towers<00:01:32.689> sit<00:01:33.259> in<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.380> middle<00:01:33.499> of

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
take out the towers sit in the middle of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.219 
take out the towers sit in the middle of
the<00:01:33.710> end<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.219> then<00:01:34.369> just<00:01:34.609> fire<00:01:34.969> arrows<00:01:35.960> at<00:01:36.109> it

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
the end and then just fire arrows at it

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.660 
the end and then just fire arrows at it
until<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.560> dies<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:37.069> pretty<00:01:37.249> simple<00:01:37.429> so

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
until it dies it's pretty simple so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.940 
until it dies it's pretty simple so
obviously<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.899> is<00:01:39.109> come<00:01:39.289> by<00:01:39.319> update<00:01:39.619> they<00:01:39.770> want

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
obviously it is come by update they want

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.279 
obviously it is come by update they want
to<00:01:40.009> make<00:01:40.100> people<00:01:40.249> focus<00:01:41.179> more<00:01:41.479> on<00:01:41.509> combat<00:01:42.049> so

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
to make people focus more on combat so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.719 
to make people focus more on combat so

harder<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.179> possibly<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.170> my

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
harder and possibly this is just my

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.529 
harder and possibly this is just my
opinion<00:01:45.920> they<00:01:46.490> keep<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.819> change<00:01:47.149> the

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
opinion they keep that change the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.410 
opinion they keep that change the
difficulty<00:01:47.929> of<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.439> actual<00:01:48.889> fight<00:01:49.249> with<00:01:49.999> the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
difficulty button so hard for example we

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.269 
difficulty button so hard for example we
could<00:01:52.520> actually<00:01:52.840> fire<00:01:53.840> thermo<00:01:54.560> fireballs<00:01:55.159> are

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
could actually fire thermo fireballs are

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.859 
could actually fire thermo fireballs are

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
we've seen one screenshot of it kind of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.340 
we've seen one screenshot of it kind of
in<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> glass<00:02:22.970> cage<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.930> almost<00:02:24.080> looks

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
in like a glass cage and it almost looks

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.960 
in like a glass cage and it almost looks
like<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.470> beacon<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.100> then<00:02:25.610> we've<00:02:25.700> got<00:02:25.730> another

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
like a beacon and then we've got another

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.060 
like a beacon and then we've got another
screenshot<00:02:26.300> with<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.260> kind<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.800> been<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.010> a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
screenshot with it kind of been like a

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.890 
screenshot with it kind of been like a
log<00:02:28.550> circle<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.120> armor<00:02:29.420> stand<00:02:29.630> sitting

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
log circle with armor stand sitting

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.110 
log circle with armor stand sitting
around<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.920> there's<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.850> really

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
around it so and it's there's not really

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.640 
around it so and it's there's not really
been<00:02:35.360> any<00:02:35.660> proper<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:38.260> evidence<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.350> say<00:02:39.500> what

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
been any proper and evidence to say what

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.280 
been any proper and evidence to say what
it<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:40.300> but<00:02:41.300> people<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.660> lot<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.990> people<00:02:42.080> on<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
it is but people a lot of people on the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.100 
it is but people a lot of people on the
radio<00:02:42.530> saying<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.950> it's<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.840> Medusa<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:45.020> a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
radio saying that it's a Medusa like a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.610 
radio saying that it's a Medusa like a
beacon<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.410> felt<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.620> reversed<00:02:46.160> reverse<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
beacon of felt like reversed reverse so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.230 
beacon of felt like reversed reverse so
effects<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.340> player<00:02:49.550> rather<00:02:49.880> than<00:02:50.030> add

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
effects on the player rather than add

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.960 
effects on the player rather than add
effects<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.830> that's<00:02:52.010> bus<00:02:52.340> possibly<00:02:52.700> play<00:02:52.820> good

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
effects so that's bus possibly play good

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.720 
effects so that's bus possibly play good
but<00:02:53.180> remember<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.630> combat<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:55.370> gotta<00:02:55.580> be

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
but remember is combat so it's gotta be

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.100 
but remember is combat so it's gotta be
something<00:02:55.790> linked<00:02:56.210> with<00:02:56.300> combat<00:02:56.600> maybe<00:02:56.840> it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
something linked with combat maybe it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.660 
something linked with combat maybe it
could<00:02:57.260> be<00:02:57.380> some<00:02:57.530> kind<00:02:57.710> of<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.190> could<00:02:58.370> be<00:02:58.520> some

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
could be some kind of it could be some

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.460 
could be some kind of it could be some
kind<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.850> weapon<00:02:59.030> upgrader<00:02:59.510> maybe<00:03:00.260> you

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
kind of weapon upgrader maybe you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.080 
kind of weapon upgrader maybe you
right-click<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.160> put<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.400> weapon<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.850> and

right-click on it put a weapon in and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.000 
right-click on it put a weapon in and
it'll<00:03:02.240> upgrade<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.170> now<00:03:03.830> that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it'll upgrade it for you and now that

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.950 
it'll upgrade it for you and now that
links<00:03:04.280> quite<00:03:04.490> nicely<00:03:04.700> onto<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.900> I'm

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
links quite nicely onto and what I'm

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960 
links quite nicely onto and what I'm
thinking<00:03:06.230> about<00:03:06.290> for<00:03:06.710> personal<00:03:07.580> updates<00:03:07.670> that

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
thinking about for personal updates that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.640 
thinking about for personal updates that
I'd<00:03:08.120> like<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.420> see<00:03:08.540> one<00:03:08.990> of<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.140> main<00:03:09.320> ones<00:03:09.350> I'd

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
I'd like to see one of the main ones I'd

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.950 
I'd like to see one of the main ones I'd
like<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.950> see<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.400> an<00:03:11.090> enchantment<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> bow

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
like to see is an enchantment for a bow

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.050 
like to see is an enchantment for a bow
which<00:03:12.260> fires<00:03:12.530> three<00:03:12.980> arrows<00:03:13.280> at<00:03:13.400> once<00:03:13.580> or<00:03:13.760> like

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
which fires three arrows at once or like

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.180 
which fires three arrows at once or like
up<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.450> three<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:14.990> then<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:15.950> might<00:03:16.100> think

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
up to three and then you might think

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.620 
up to three and then you might think
that's<00:03:16.310> quite<00:03:16.460> ope<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.120> obviously<00:03:17.450> they

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
that's quite ope but obviously they

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.320 
that's quite ope but obviously they
would<00:03:17.750> be<00:03:17.920> some<00:03:18.920> kind<00:03:19.130> of<00:03:19.190> down<00:03:19.820> grace<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.239> the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
would be some kind of down grace to the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.910 
would be some kind of down grace to the
weapon<00:03:20.570> as<00:03:20.690> well<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.290> i'm<00:03:21.410> thinking<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.770> at<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
weapon as well so i'm thinking is at the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.860 
weapon as well so i'm thinking is at the
moment<00:03:22.250> when<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.820> fire<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.000> arrow<00:03:23.209> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
moment when you fire one arrow it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.510 
moment when you fire one arrow it
practically<00:03:24.350> follows<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.830> cross<00:03:25.040> there<00:03:25.250> and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
practically follows the cross there and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.060 
practically follows the cross there and
lands<00:03:26.330> on<00:03:26.480> your<00:03:26.660> target<00:03:26.840> depending<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.590> you

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
lands on your target depending on you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.790 
lands on your target depending on you
know<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> height<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.720> vertical<00:03:30.050> axis<00:03:30.080> but<00:03:30.560> if

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
know the height the vertical axis but if

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.890 
know the height the vertical axis but if
you<00:03:30.920> could<00:03:31.190> fly<00:03:31.340> three<00:03:31.760> say<00:03:32.000> could<00:03:32.660> be<00:03:32.690> called

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
you could fly three say could be called

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.340 
you could fly three say could be called
multi<00:03:33.320> aryl<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.890> moti<00:03:34.370> MultiAir<00:03:35.300> 0<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.510> phi<00:03:36.290> 2
