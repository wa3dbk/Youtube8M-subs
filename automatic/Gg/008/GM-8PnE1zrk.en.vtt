00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
tuning in to this video team kaliber has

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.940 
tuning in to this video team kaliber has
decided<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.880> cease<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.480> operations

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
decided to cease all operations

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.249 
decided to cease all operations
involving<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.070> knifing<00:00:20.490> division<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.259> while

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
involving the knifing division and while

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.960 
involving the knifing division and while
don't<00:00:22.529> necessarily<00:00:23.130> agree<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
don't necessarily agree with the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
don't necessarily agree with the
decision<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.720> felt<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.410> maybe<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.710> needed

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
decision I felt like maybe we needed

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.590 
decision I felt like maybe we needed
more<00:00:26.550> time<00:00:26.699> warp<00:00:26.970> some<00:00:27.090> other<00:00:27.210> things<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
more time warp some other things out and

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.990 
more time warp some other things out and
that<00:00:27.720> sort<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.990> thing<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:29.430> know<00:00:29.550> they've

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that sort of thing but you know they've

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400 
that sort of thing but you know they've
already<00:00:30.150> made<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> decision<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.170> what's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
already made the decision and what's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.080 
already made the decision and what's
done<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> done<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.129> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.580> definitely<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
done is done so this is definitely not a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.939 
done is done so this is definitely not a
video<00:00:33.360> bashing<00:00:33.840> team<00:00:34.080> kaliber<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.620> anything

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
video bashing team kaliber or anything

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.369 
video bashing team kaliber or anything
like<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.269> I<00:00:36.269> do<00:00:36.540> definitely<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
like that I do definitely like a

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.380 
like that I do definitely like a
majority<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> people<00:00:38.730> who<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.210> there

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
majority of the people who are in there

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
majority of the people who are in there
and<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.720> I<00:00:39.780> wish<00:00:40.019> them<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.230> best<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.650> luck<00:00:40.710> from

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and so I wish them the best of luck from

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.329 
and so I wish them the best of luck from
that<00:00:41.220> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.150> actually<00:00:42.479> offered<00:00:42.839> to<00:00:43.339> stay

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
that and I was actually offered to stay

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.729 
that and I was actually offered to stay
on<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.519> team<00:00:44.699> from<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.089> different<00:00:45.449> aspect<00:00:45.870> but

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
on the team from a different aspect but

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.350 
on the team from a different aspect but
I<00:00:46.799> didn't<00:00:46.979> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.150> what

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I didn't want to do that and that's what

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.719 
I didn't want to do that and that's what
this<00:00:48.479> video<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.080> of<00:00:49.199> about<00:00:49.610> I'm<00:00:50.610> not

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
this video is kind of about I'm not

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.060 
this video is kind of about I'm not
going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.089> detail<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.720> it's<00:00:51.900> not<00:00:52.140> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
going to detail because it's not really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.030 
going to detail because it's not really
of<00:00:53.220> any<00:00:53.309> importance<00:00:54.269> as<00:00:54.600> far<00:00:54.839> as<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.619> general

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
of any importance as far as the general

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.079 
of any importance as far as the general
public<00:00:56.339> i<00:00:56.400> guess<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.760> sort<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> thing

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
public i guess and that sort of thing

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.189 
public i guess and that sort of thing
but<00:00:57.869> i<00:00:57.930> didn't<00:00:58.530> feel<00:00:58.650> right<00:00:59.839> you<00:01:00.839> know<00:01:00.869> staying

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
but i didn't feel right you know staying

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.289 
but i didn't feel right you know staying
on<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> team<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:01.830> any<00:01:01.979> means<00:01:02.220> even<00:01:02.549> if<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.879> felt

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
on the team and any means even if I felt

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.460 
on the team and any means even if I felt
like<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> probably<00:01:03.809> would<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:03.989> benefited<00:01:04.379> me

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
like it probably would have benefited me

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
like it probably would have benefited me
maybe<00:01:04.650> personally<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:06.150> far<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> growth

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
maybe personally as far as just a growth

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.649 
maybe personally as far as just a growth
standpoint<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.560> sort<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.570> me

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
standpoint that sort of thing but to me

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.940
