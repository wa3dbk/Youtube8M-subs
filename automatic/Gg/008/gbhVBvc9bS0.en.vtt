00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.790 
whatever that mystery character could be
so<00:06:16.880> we<00:06:17.090> haven't<00:06:17.300> got<00:06:17.389> any<00:06:17.570> doubles<00:06:18.020> yet<00:06:18.199> so<00:06:18.530> it

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
so we haven't got any doubles yet so it

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.650 
so we haven't got any doubles yet so it
can<00:06:18.919> open<00:06:19.070> amidst<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.520> new<00:06:19.820> case<00:06:20.120> in<00:06:20.150> order

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
can open amidst a new case in order

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.200 
can open amidst a new case in order
there's<00:06:21.410> brand<00:06:22.310> new<00:06:22.490> toys<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:22.850> won't<00:06:23.000> get

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
there's brand new toys you won't get

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.580 
there's brand new toys you won't get
doubles<00:06:23.630> as<00:06:23.750> long<00:06:23.900> as<00:06:23.990> you<00:06:24.050> open<00:06:24.260> up<00:06:24.320> from<00:06:24.440> the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
doubles as long as you open up from the

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.089 
doubles as long as you open up from the
one<00:06:24.770> half<00:06:25.070> so<00:06:25.940> let's<00:06:26.539> find<00:06:26.780> out<00:06:26.960> who<00:06:27.500> we<00:06:27.680> got<00:06:27.889> we

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
one half so let's find out who we got we

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.089 
one half so let's find out who we got we
got<00:06:28.130> Sven<00:06:29.380> so<00:06:30.380> it's<00:06:30.560> almost<00:06:30.710> like<00:06:30.979> we're

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
got Sven so it's almost like we're

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.070 
got Sven so it's almost like we're
getting<00:06:31.310> all<00:06:31.460> these<00:06:31.580> toys<00:06:31.880> in<00:06:32.180> order

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
getting all these toys in order

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.219 
getting all these toys in order
spen<00:06:33.680> looks<00:06:33.919> really<00:06:34.430> cool<00:06:34.849> so<00:06:35.750> if<00:06:36.020> we<00:06:36.110> got

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
spen looks really cool so if we got

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.839 
spen looks really cool so if we got
spending<00:06:36.590> for<00:06:36.710> box<00:06:36.860> number<00:06:37.070> seven<00:06:37.370> hopefully

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
spending for box number seven hopefully

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.060 
spending for box number seven hopefully
we<00:06:37.970> got<00:06:38.120> that<00:06:38.270> chaser<00:06:38.720> figure<00:06:39.139> at<00:06:39.320> number

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
we got that chaser figure at number

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.450 
we got that chaser figure at number
eight

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
eight

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.640 
eight
but<00:06:40.550> you<00:06:40.639> remember<00:06:40.940> there's<00:06:41.120> only<00:06:41.360> one<00:06:42.110> chaser

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
but you remember there's only one chaser

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.490 
but you remember there's only one chaser
figure<00:06:42.979> in<00:06:43.160> the<00:06:43.370> entire<00:06:43.639> case<00:06:43.940> so<00:06:44.900> that's

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
figure in the entire case so that's

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.170 
figure in the entire case so that's
either<00:06:45.770> a<00:06:45.919> double<00:06:46.340> or<00:06:46.820> or<00:06:47.810> the<00:06:48.110> chaser<00:06:48.470> figure

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
either a double or or the chaser figure

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.089 
either a double or or the chaser figure
so<00:06:50.180> let's<00:06:50.780> put<00:06:50.900> spend<00:06:51.139> right<00:06:51.320> there<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:51.740> open

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
so let's put spend right there and open

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:54.490 
so let's put spend right there and open
up<00:06:52.160> our<00:06:52.310> very<00:06:52.639> very<00:06:52.760> last<00:06:53.270> box<00:06:53.690> hopefully<00:06:54.349> we

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
up our very very last box hopefully we

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:11.189 
up our very very last box hopefully we
get<00:06:54.620> that<00:06:54.680> mystery<00:06:55.250> character

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.529 

and<00:07:12.199> we<00:07:12.349> got<00:07:12.469> a<00:07:12.499> double<00:07:12.919> we<00:07:13.039> got<00:07:13.159> Olaf<00:07:13.699> well<00:07:14.059> we

and we got a double we got Olaf well we
had<00:07:14.779> to<00:07:14.930> get<00:07:15.050> a<00:07:15.080> double<00:07:15.349> at<00:07:15.649> least<00:07:15.680> we<00:07:15.979> got<00:07:16.069> a

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:16.129 
had to get a double at least we got a

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:18.639 
had to get a double at least we got a
double<00:07:16.369> of<00:07:16.669> my<00:07:16.939> favorite<00:07:17.389> character<00:07:17.809> all<00:07:18.139> off

double of my favorite character all off

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:20.320 
double of my favorite character all off
well<00:07:19.009> let's<00:07:19.189> compare<00:07:19.309> him<00:07:19.729> just<00:07:19.939> to<00:07:20.029> make<00:07:20.149> sure

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
well let's compare him just to make sure

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.879 
well let's compare him just to make sure
he's<00:07:20.509> not<00:07:20.599> any<00:07:20.809> different<00:07:21.020> than<00:07:21.589> the<00:07:21.710> other

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889 
he's not any different than the other

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:23.739 
he's not any different than the other
Olaf<00:07:22.339> and<00:07:22.639> it<00:07:22.939> looks<00:07:23.059> like<00:07:23.119> they're<00:07:23.300> exactly

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:23.749 
Olaf and it looks like they're exactly

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:28.389 
Olaf and it looks like they're exactly
identical<00:07:24.879> so<00:07:25.930> that<00:07:26.930> is<00:07:27.139> the<00:07:27.319> eight<00:07:27.680> boxes

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:28.399 
identical so that is the eight boxes

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.619 
identical so that is the eight boxes
that<00:07:28.550> we<00:07:28.639> were<00:07:28.729> gonna<00:07:28.819> go<00:07:28.999> ahead<00:07:29.059> and<00:07:29.270> open<00:07:29.360> up
