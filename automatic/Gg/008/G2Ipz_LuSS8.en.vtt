a nice single file line behind you

a nice single file line behind you
waiting<00:02:59.250> their<00:02:59.760> death<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.480> most<00:03:00.660> part<00:03:00.870> so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.290 
waiting their death for the most part so
it<00:03:01.620> was<00:03:01.770> kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:01.980> difficult<00:03:02.240> eventually<00:03:03.240> I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
it was kind of difficult eventually I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300 
it was kind of difficult eventually I
look<00:03:03.960> at<00:03:04.080> my<00:03:04.170> sub<00:03:04.410> box<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.710> see<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> video<00:03:05.010> from

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
look at my sub box to see a video from

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.400 
look at my sub box to see a video from
yogi<00:03:05.580> slaya<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.180> he<00:03:06.600> was<00:03:06.690> running<00:03:07.080> trains

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
yogi slaya and he was running trains

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.990 
yogi slaya and he was running trains
here<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.070> call<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> fork<00:03:08.670> he<00:03:08.880> also

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
here and we call it the fork he also

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.850 
here and we call it the fork he also
called<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.870> Buddha<00:03:10.230> room<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.710> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
called the the Buddha room I like the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380 
called the the Buddha room I like the
fort<00:03:11.100> sounds<00:03:11.400> manly<00:03:11.580> or<00:03:11.730> some<00:03:11.940> stuffer<00:03:12.270> and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
fort sounds manly or some stuffer and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.420 
fort sounds manly or some stuffer and
essentially<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.500> running<00:03:13.830> trains<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.250> here

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
essentially just running trains in here

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.130 
essentially just running trains in here
like<00:03:14.610> well<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.940> looks<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.360> neat<00:03:15.660> area<00:03:15.900> so

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
like well that looks like a neat area so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.630 
like well that looks like a neat area so
I<00:03:16.200> tried<00:03:16.500> out<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.740> first<00:03:17.070> time<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> tried<00:03:17.610> this

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I tried out the first time I tried this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.630 
I tried out the first time I tried this
little<00:03:18.480> strategy<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.110> guess<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.620> will<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:19.980> I

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
little strategy I guess if you will is I

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.730 
little strategy I guess if you will is I
mate<00:03:20.850> around<00:03:21.060> 25<00:03:21.510> until<00:03:21.990> eventually<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.440> walked

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
mate around 25 until eventually I walked

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.170 
mate around 25 until eventually I walked
through<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:22.920> door<00:03:23.040> word<00:03:23.459> she<00:03:23.640> put<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> place

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
through that door word she put the place

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
through that door word she put the place
I<00:03:24.330> chest<00:03:24.630> went<00:03:24.870> down<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.350> walked<00:03:25.920> into<00:03:26.130> that

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I chest went down I walked into that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
door I get put down and that was the end

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.710 
door I get put down and that was the end
of<00:03:28.590> my<00:03:28.650> game<00:03:28.920> my<00:03:29.100> next<00:03:29.610> try<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.850> was<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.510> one

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
of my game my next try it was this one

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.150 
of my game my next try it was this one
right<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:30.930> you're<00:03:31.230> seeing<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.010> made

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
right here you're seeing it and I made

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.680 
right here you're seeing it and I made
it<00:03:32.250> through<00:03:32.340> round<00:03:32.370> 50<00:03:32.820> I'm<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.090> good<00:03:33.360> golly

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
it through round 50 I'm like good golly

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.660 
it through round 50 I'm like good golly
gracious<00:03:34.260> i<00:03:34.410> haven't<00:03:34.620> tried<00:03:34.740> sensing<00:03:35.340> i<00:03:35.490> could

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
gracious i haven't tried sensing i could

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.540 
gracious i haven't tried sensing i could
probably<00:03:35.910> also<00:03:36.150> get<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> upper<00:03:36.840> 70s<00:03:37.550> it's

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
probably also get in the upper 70s it's

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.160 
probably also get in the upper 70s it's
just<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.790> matter<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.120> how<00:03:39.240> much<00:03:39.420> time<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.870> also

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
just a matter of how much time you also

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.260 
just a matter of how much time you also
have<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> little<00:03:41.490> bit<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.640> luck<00:03:41.910> as<00:03:42.090> well

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
have and a little bit of luck as well

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.460

the<00:04:05.820> strategy<00:04:06.240> itself<00:04:06.540> though<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:07.020> pretty

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
the strategy itself though is pretty

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.260 
the strategy itself though is pretty
sound<00:04:07.680> because<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.250> one<00:04:08.430> down<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.880> saw<00:04:09.090> me

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
sound because that one down you saw me

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.050 
sound because that one down you saw me
have<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.780> literally<00:04:10.709> my<00:04:11.010> first<00:04:11.310> down<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.850> this

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
have is literally my first down of this

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.970 
have is literally my first down of this
match<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.630> know<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.380> problem<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.770> room

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.650 
match you know the problem of the room
is<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.250> i<00:04:14.370> like<00:04:14.610> i<00:04:14.700> said<00:04:14.880> though<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.060> room

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
is like i like i said though the room

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.409 
is like i like i said though the room
itself<00:04:15.989> it's<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.380> really<00:04:16.560> good<00:04:16.739> place<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.130> go

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
itself it's a really good place to go

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.240 
itself it's a really good place to go
very<00:04:18.419> rarely<00:04:18.750> will<00:04:18.930> occurrences<00:04:19.919> like<00:04:20.040> that

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
very rarely will occurrences like that

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.560

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
end up going down touch your kind of

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.320 
end up going down touch your kind of
funny<00:05:23.039> when<00:05:23.280> you<00:05:23.370> look<00:05:23.520> at<00:05:23.699> it<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.910> way<00:05:24.060> I<00:05:24.090> go

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.640 
funny when you look at it the way I go
down<00:05:24.509> but<00:05:24.750> now<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.110> guess<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:25.440> cross<00:05:25.620> that

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
down but now I guess we cross that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.749 
down but now I guess we cross that
bridge<00:05:25.949> here<00:05:26.220> in<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.340> moment<00:05:26.610> when<00:05:26.699> we

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
bridge here in the moment when we

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.830 
bridge here in the moment when we
