00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.759
 had to recognize from the faith of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 this great controlling institution of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.740
 the food obviously that's where 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.889
 they teach that the chickens brought arsenic 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.049
 in North America is not the case of what 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 what happens here in Chile and obviously that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 everything is producing the generation 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 accelerated of many types of cancers in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.800
 people now we do have the note and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.800
 we go 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.219
 chicken is one of the most foods 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.989
 consumed feeling them some years have 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.850
 ignited the alarms by the great 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.590
 amount of hormones that are added 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.500
 but now the situation is even worse 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.129
 because I could pay attention to cause 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 Cancer 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.210
 I listen well to this food so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.070
 desired that is present in many 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 of our meals could be the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 responsible for many diseases among 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.860
 they cancer 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 the alarm is turned on in the sixth region 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.910
 when a few months ago he found 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.880
 dioxins in the chickens of the plant 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.860
 agrosúper de requínoa in rancagua when 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.229
 this substance enters the body can 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.710
 cause from cancer to problems 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710
 immunological 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 the chile the issue of the toxin was 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.780
 present in pork meats and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.750
 also in some chicken meats but 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.310
 I understand that this has been solved 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.390
 therefore it must be the authority 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.440
 health minister of health 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.350
 physically who is permanently 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.240
 supervising this issue and taking the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.540
 corrective measures that do not apply 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.979
 I know exactly what the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.410
 Friction theme in chickens but 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.100
 I know that until July of this year there was 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.100
 a brain problem 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.010
 the situation is serious since near the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.590
 10% of different types of cancer 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.690
 are produced by the farewell molecule 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.790
 Also, exposure to these 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.140
 substances under 2 years can 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.720
 cause problems in the system 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.850
 immune for life what is 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.710
 translate in that these people will suffer 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.710
 different infections in your body 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.610
 for us it is very impressive to see 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.010
 how this happens and through is supposed 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 which is a medication that is given to 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.900
 chickens contained arsenic just to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.880
 deworm the let's say and that this 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.850
 so it's probably happening 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.560
 a long time ago and there is no or you did not know 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.750
 or would not continue or did not want to be known 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.090
 they 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.700
 the text agricultural and livestock service 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.850
 43 thousand kilos of chicken meat with 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.140
 dioxin in the agrosuper plant 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.120
 We try to communicate with different 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.440
 companies but no one did 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.440
 refer to this topic 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.340
 and there are carcinogenic supports the attention what 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.890
 that he was finally are awful 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.450
 like right now an one was in the background 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.430
 that are uncovering these great 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.989
 like where people dare to jump 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.400
 suddenly against big company but for 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.299
 usually for many years that's why 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.370
 the best all with the chickens 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.319
 carcinogens is was upside down 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.909
 let's say they had so much power that all 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.590
 quiet and there what happens that I think 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.319
 that we are already poisoning ourselves but 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.939
 everywhere I think that everything has 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.680
 a product that in a certain way 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.780
 poisons in some way and monya 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.430
 with me a lot of support in my life I'm going to 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.930
 to die to spend the truth 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.150
 scenic so we're not far from 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.099
 be reality nothing I go and I think it 's the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.930
 food issue surprises us more before 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.370
 the milk spike pyramid nowadays 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.109
 we all know that milk makes terrible 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.299
 alalay consume milk the subject the 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.939
 transgenic the subject of how finally 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.040
 by means of hormones develop 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.150
 certain types of food to be able to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.549
 do it effectively a larger business 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.799
 sad I hope more programs will be regulated 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.150
 realization to be able to be more 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.829
 sure of what one consumes and not 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.239
 ending up sick that day is very 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.889
 important to know first I think it's 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.120
 happening in the USA and know if it's from a 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.500
 another way does not bounce here 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 the minimum you know that what you are 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.370
 eating chicken of 19 your things that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.290
 are not chickens pichicateros 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.049
 but this is not happening only in 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.360
 chile in usa the food agency and 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.299
 medicines admitted that the meat of the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.129
 North American chickens cause cancer 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.650
 study determined that the chickens 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.010
 contain arsenic a chemical that causes 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.229
 cancer and that is deadly in high doses the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.530
 arsenic would be added to the food of 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.530
 the birds 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.050
 for years they wanted to deny this 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.270
 possibility saying that arsenic was 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.070
 excreted by the hens and did not arrive 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.260
 to the human body but now with the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.600
 study the evidence is undeniable both 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.610
 so the pink company sonia decided 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.330
 remove the product from the shelves 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.310
 but only the us and admitted that no 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.520
 will necessarily remove these 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.210
 products in the countries 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.150
 Arsenic is a poison 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.090
 and if the chickens have so many hormones 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.300
 imagine with an arsenic is like to 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.380
 die feel good technicians of the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.490
 disease 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.640
 is medicine of life then yes that 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.220
 they inspect that and the universe forbids it 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.600
 of responsibility on the part of the government 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.220
 which are the ones that control each one 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.780
 entry of this kind animals like 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.910
 also another type of product are 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.790
 harmful the children toys that are 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.830
 toxic all that during a barracks 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.330
 with greater reason possible in and with a 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.300
 poison in case it's in the north in 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.250
 antofagasta clear modes so you have to 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.660
 eliminate but that irresponsibility 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.060
 but sweet but nevertheless for the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.760
 people who do it seems to me extremely 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.070
 horrible 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.220
 because that shows first that no 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.710
 exists or if it exists, there could be little 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.680
 control over food I 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.040
 it seems wrong or in reality all 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.320
 the chickens are like more 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.670
 more processed now than before 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.960
 and that we do not have to buy this type 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.200
 whether they are going to hurt and I think 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.200
 we have 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.530
 if it were necessary it would be but if we 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.380
 we will harm I think 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:17.810
 right not to allow entry 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:20.890
 because there is a possibility that if that 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.890
 in her 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.560
 all these backgrounds open the 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.320
 concern about what they use 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.570
 companies to feed the chickens are 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.580
 will be monitoring as appropriate 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.560
 this process could be that we are 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.560
 poisoning without knowing it 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.220
 like all morning we want to thank 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.240
 of course to mom-to-be for his thing 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.240
 really exquisite you can visit 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.940
 www.movistar.com.ve presence of 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.220
 arsenic in chickens in usa it says what 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.780
 following the products used in the 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.630
 chicken feed in the usa 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.210
 there are additives whose use is not 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.680
 authorized in Chile in our country the 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.760
 regulation of food additives 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.900
 animal is based on the registration 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.520
 of additives for 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.170
 animal feed in Europe 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.450
 names of the products are not 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.070
 the regulations are authorized 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.900
 European has the highest standards 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.910
 of safety for products 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.190
 intended for animal feed and 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.080
 considers the impact on human health 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.510
 by the indicated ones we can affirm that 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.000
 the products questioned in the usa no 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.980
 the sat fix is used in Chile 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.600
 permanently makes the manufacturing 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.490
 of food for the birds watching 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.320
 for the use for not using these 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.870
 substances that do not exist at the date of 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.150
 reports of your latest product the 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.480
 products that remove from the us what also 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.760
 they take back the products 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.340
 to the countries that import those chickens 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.830
 because it is clear to me that sag is not 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.720
 say raising chickens in chile but 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.610
 what about the export of chickens and or 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.590
 I do not have the exact figure of how much support 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.140
 chile exports but I get the feeling 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.330
 that something falls is not true that now 

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.700
 mercola or therefore I think it's me 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.620
 a little bit of oil is missing. 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.160
 sachs and now for us it is not 

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.160
 made of chicken
