00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
used Vargas in goal instead just because

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.770

you should probably steer clear of the
goalkeeper<00:03:54.799> he<00:03:54.980> looks<00:03:55.160> absolutely<00:03:55.459> dreadful

cost<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.620> quite<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.799> lot<00:04:07.040> although<00:04:07.220> apart<00:04:07.880> from

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
cost you quite a lot although apart from

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.550 
cost you quite a lot although apart from
Muriel<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.450> most<00:04:08.690> expensive<00:04:09.140> player<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.350> think

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
Muriel the most expensive player I think

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.379 
Muriel the most expensive player I think
is<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.680> Pereira<00:04:10.130> at<00:04:10.250> six<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.609> a<00:04:10.639> half<00:04:10.670> K<00:04:11.030> the

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
is that Pereira at six and a half K the

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.270 
is that Pereira at six and a half K the
rest<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:11.750> them<00:04:11.840> are<00:04:11.989> pretty<00:04:12.350> reasonable<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.010> Oh

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
rest of them are pretty reasonable so Oh

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.280 
rest of them are pretty reasonable so Oh
actually<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.150> full-backs<00:04:14.510> Armero<00:04:14.930> cost<00:04:15.170> me

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
actually the full-backs Armero cost me

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.529 
actually the full-backs Armero cost me
23,000<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.220> think<00:04:16.400> arias<00:04:16.760> was<00:04:16.789> like<00:04:17.060> five<00:04:17.359> as

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
23,000 I think arias was like five as

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.420 
23,000 I think arias was like five as
well<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.350> quite<00:04:18.560> an<00:04:18.709> expensive<00:04:18.919> team<00:04:19.250> but

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
well so it's quite an expensive team but

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.500 
well so it's quite an expensive team but
