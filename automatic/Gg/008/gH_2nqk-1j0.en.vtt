00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
gun in this game that could be a primary

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.480 
gun in this game that could be a primary
because<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.180> how<00:02:03.270> deadly<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.189> one<00:02:05.340> thing

already
I<00:02:11.039> thought<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.970> with

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
I thought you on that with

I thought you on that with
you<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.110> regarding<00:02:13.680> some<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> other

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
guns but movement with the desert eagle

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.290 
guns but movement with the desert eagle
is<00:02:16.769> important<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.120> accurate

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
is important because you can be accurate

while moving so practicing you know

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.240

of<00:02:23.370> sticky<00:02:23.640> situations<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:24.959> also<00:02:25.110> being

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
of sticky situations and then also being

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.479 
of sticky situations and then also being
accurate<00:02:25.739> with<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> gun<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.190> something<00:02:26.400> that

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
accurate with the gun is something that

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.369 
accurate with the gun is something that
you<00:02:26.550> definitely<00:02:26.670> want<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.120> try<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> perfect

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
you definitely want to try to perfect

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.530 
you definitely want to try to perfect
while<00:02:28.769> you're<00:02:28.920> using<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.519> in<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> deathmatch

while you're using it in the deathmatch

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.050 
while you're using it in the deathmatch
and<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.590> would<00:02:31.709> say<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.010> gun<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.849> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and I would say this gun is one that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.900 
and I would say this gun is one that
benefits<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.660> most<00:02:33.840> from<00:02:34.019> death<00:02:34.319> matching

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
benefits the most from death matching

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.860 
benefits the most from death matching

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
opinions on that but for me when I was

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.699 
opinions on that but for me when I was
in<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.120> prime<00:02:39.330> which<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.780> am<00:02:39.870> far<00:02:40.200> from<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.560> now

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
when I was in my prime and my deagle was

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.180 
when I was in my prime and my deagle was
really<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.260> was<00:02:49.349> because<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.680> def<00:02:49.950> match

with it you know an hour to a day and

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.309 
with it you know an hour to a day and
you'll<00:02:52.799> see<00:02:53.010> instant<00:02:53.760> results<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:55.200> any

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the deagle in particular I think you'll

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.750 
the deagle in particular I think you'll
see<00:02:59.599> see<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.630> lot<00:03:00.840> quicker<00:03:01.019> than<00:03:01.640> some<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
see see a lot quicker than some of the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the reload time on it is actually the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.870 
the reload time on it is actually the
quickest<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> any<00:03:13.410> pistol<00:03:13.829> if<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:14.790> not

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
quickest of any pistol if I'm not

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.220 
quickest of any pistol if I'm not
mistaken<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.450> might<00:03:15.569> not<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> quickest

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
mistaken it might not be the quickest

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.720 
mistaken it might not be the quickest
but<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.380> know<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:16.680> faster<00:03:16.950> than<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.130> USP<00:03:17.549> and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
but I know it's faster than the USP and

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.170 
but I know it's faster than the USP and
the<00:03:17.970> Glock<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.440> animation<00:03:20.150> finishes<00:03:21.150> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the Glock so the animation finishes a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300 
the Glock so the animation finishes a
lot<00:03:21.359> quicker<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.319> don't<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.530> afraid<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.799> spin

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
lot quicker so don't be afraid to spin

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.300
