00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
number eight cylinder had issues with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.630 
number eight cylinder had issues with
overheating<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.650> actually<00:02:46.650> cracking<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
overheating and actually cracking in the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.350 
overheating and actually cracking in the
cylinder<00:02:48.270> itself<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.550> I'm<00:02:50.820> hoping<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.150> not

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
cylinder itself so I'm hoping that's not

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.950 
cylinder itself so I'm hoping that's not
the<00:02:51.450> case<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.410> don't<00:02:52.710> know<00:02:53.750> when<00:02:54.750> this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
the case but I don't know when this

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.130 
the case but I don't know when this
motor<00:02:55.200> was<00:02:55.470> produced<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.100> no<00:02:56.280> idea

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
motor was produced I have no idea

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.720 
motor was produced I have no idea
because<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.380> crate<00:02:58.650> motor<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
because it was a crate motor in the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.310 
because it was a crate motor in the
other<00:02:59.880> truck<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.750> put<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.020> into<00:03:01.140> this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
other truck and then I put it into this

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.740 
other truck and then I put it into this
truck<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:01.920> don't<00:03:02.130> know<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.900> oh<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.630> then

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
