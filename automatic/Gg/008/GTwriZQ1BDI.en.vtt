we<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.110> sometimes<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:34.890> petty<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.640> can

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we can be sometimes pretty petty we can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
we can be sometimes pretty petty we can
be<00:01:35.909> sometimes<00:01:36.150> jealous<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.320> would

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
be sometimes jealous and I would

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.530 
be sometimes jealous and I would
understand<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.610> those<00:01:38.729> abilities<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
understand if I had those abilities I

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.390 
understand if I had those abilities I
think<00:01:39.840> there'd<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.200> few<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.740> semi<00:01:41.070> trucks

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
think there'd be a few more semi trucks

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
think there'd be a few more semi trucks
wrapped<00:01:41.670> around<00:01:41.820> trees<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.380> crew

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
wrapped around trees I think the crew

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
wrapped around trees I think the crew

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
sound and then listening to the the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.559 
sound and then listening to the the
echoes<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.250> sound<00:03:05.489> bouncing<00:03:06.000> off<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.209> an

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
echoes of that sound bouncing off of an

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.080 
echoes of that sound bouncing off of an
object<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.319> sounds<00:03:07.800> pretty<00:03:08.340> difficult<00:03:08.670> for

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
object that sounds pretty difficult for

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.479 
object that sounds pretty difficult for
your<00:03:09.180> average<00:03:09.450> human<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.870> do<00:03:10.019> well<00:03:10.560> yes<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.400> no

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
your average human to do well yes and no

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.930 
your average human to do well yes and no
I<00:03:11.640> mean<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.090> think<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:13.230> um<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.670> knew<00:03:14.790> what

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
I mean I think that um if you knew what

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.759 
I mean I think that um if you knew what
you<00:03:14.970> were<00:03:15.060> listening<00:03:15.269> for<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> mean<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.620> would

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
you were listening for I mean you would

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.770 
you were listening for I mean you would
hear<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.159> plate<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.519> for<00:03:17.730> example<00:03:17.790> when

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
hear it in plate like for example when

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.119 
hear it in plate like for example when
you're<00:03:18.930> driving<00:03:19.110> around<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.590> traffic<00:03:19.890> right

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
you're driving around in traffic right

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.369 
you're driving around in traffic right
and<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.790> pass<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> bunch<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.080> stores

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
and you pass like a bunch of stores

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.080 
and you pass like a bunch of stores
let's<00:03:22.680> say<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.190> can<00:03:23.340> sort<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.580> hear<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.849> sound

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
let's say you can sort of hear the sound

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.559 
let's say you can sort of hear the sound
change<00:03:24.450> as<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.230> are<00:03:25.530> between<00:03:26.099> stores<00:03:26.549> it's<00:03:27.000> in

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
change as you are between stores it's in

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.820 
change as you are between stores it's in
other<00:03:27.720> words<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.019> sounds<00:03:28.260> different<00:03:28.379> in<00:03:28.650> front

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
other words it sounds different in front

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.199 
other words it sounds different in front
of<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.950> store<00:03:29.159> that<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.879> does<00:03:30.030> when<00:03:30.180> there's

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
of a store that it does when there's

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.149 
of a store that it does when there's
nothing<00:03:30.450> next<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.870> your<00:03:31.019> car<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.769> different

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
nothing next to your car so do different

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.399 
nothing next to your car so do different
objects<00:03:32.730> sound<00:03:33.120> differently<00:03:33.629> depending<00:03:33.870> on

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
objects sound differently depending on

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.199 
objects sound differently depending on
on<00:03:34.830> what<00:03:35.040> kind<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.310> environment<00:03:35.640> they<00:03:36.060> are

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
on what kind of environment they are

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.600 
on what kind of environment they are
like<00:03:36.480> if<00:03:36.690> if<00:03:37.049> you're<00:03:37.590> inside<00:03:38.040> there's<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.400> big

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
like if if you're inside there's a big

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.220 
like if if you're inside there's a big
bookcase<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.780> tell<00:03:40.019> where<00:03:40.200> that

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
bookcase can you can you tell where that

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.800 
bookcase can you can you tell where that
is<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:41.190> parked<00:03:41.549> car<00:03:41.610> for<00:03:42.060> example<00:03:42.599> how

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
is or a parked car for example how

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.960 
is or a parked car for example how
specific<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.010> get<00:03:44.159> I<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.670> sort<00:03:44.849> of

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
specific can it get I can sort of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.130 
specific can it get I can sort of
distinguish<00:03:45.299> between<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.750> couple<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.110> things

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
distinguish between a couple of things

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.600 
distinguish between a couple of things
but<00:03:46.409> I<00:03:46.470> couldn't<00:03:46.830> tell<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:46.980> exactly<00:03:47.099> what

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
but I couldn't tell you exactly what

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.979 
but I couldn't tell you exactly what
something<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.599> know<00:03:48.750> what<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.870> mean

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
something was you know what I mean

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.740 
something was you know what I mean
gotcha<00:03:49.409> is<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.610> less<00:03:50.790> viable<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
gotcha is it is it less viable in a

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.720 
gotcha is it is it less viable in a
crowded<00:03:52.080> environment<00:03:52.739> like<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.890> busy<00:03:53.250> street

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
crowded environment like a busy street

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.149 
crowded environment like a busy street
on<00:03:54.150> does<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.569> become<00:03:54.930> unusable<00:03:55.349> at<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:55.890> point

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
on does it become unusable at that point

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.839 
on does it become unusable at that point
um<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:57.360> know<00:03:57.450> what<00:03:57.599> can<00:03:57.930> um<00:03:58.769> who<00:03:59.370> but<00:03:59.549> we<00:03:59.640> did<00:03:59.819> a

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
um you know what can um who but we did a

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.449 
um you know what can um who but we did a
video<00:04:00.060> about<00:04:00.900> crossing<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.470> street<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.950> we

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
video about crossing the street and we

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.830 
video about crossing the street and we
cross<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.849> street<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.209> two<00:04:03.510> different<00:04:03.689> towns

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
cross the street in two different towns

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.839 
cross the street in two different towns
in<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.439> town<00:04:04.620> where<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.830> live<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.250> then<00:04:05.580> a

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
in the town where I live and then a

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.350 
in the town where I live and then a
Manhattan<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.129> it's<00:04:08.129> very<00:04:08.489> busy<00:04:08.790> man<00:04:09.060> there's

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
Manhattan and it's very busy man there's

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.330 
Manhattan and it's very busy man there's
a<00:04:09.420> lot<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.810> listen<00:04:10.110> for<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.560> really<00:04:11.069> as<00:04:11.189> I'm

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
a lot to listen for and really as I'm

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.530 
a lot to listen for and really as I'm
crossing<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.700> street<00:04:11.939> I'm<00:04:12.150> more<00:04:12.299> concerned

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
crossing the street I'm more concerned

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.330 
crossing the street I'm more concerned
about<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:13.409> know<00:04:13.439> is<00:04:13.650> there<00:04:13.769> anybody<00:04:13.950> coming

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
about you know is there anybody coming

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.589 
about you know is there anybody coming
in<00:04:14.400> front<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.670> me<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.909> imagine<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.450> would<00:04:15.510> be

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
in front of me I imagine it would be

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.150 
in front of me I imagine it would be
very<00:04:15.750> difficult<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.350> differentiate<00:04:16.769> between

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
very difficult to differentiate between

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.479 
very difficult to differentiate between
for<00:04:17.729> example<00:04:17.759> a<00:04:18.150> human<00:04:19.049> versus<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:19.919> solid

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
for example a human versus a solid

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.790 
for example a human versus a solid
object<00:04:20.609> are<00:04:21.090> there<00:04:21.209> any<00:04:21.329> q's<00:04:21.780> other<00:04:22.079> than<00:04:22.350> the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
object are there any q's other than the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.790 
object are there any q's other than the
person<00:04:23.070> moving

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
person moving

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.439 
person moving
under<00:04:24.099> speaking<00:04:24.580> or<00:04:24.759> breathing<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.389> you

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
under speaking or breathing that you

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.480 
under speaking or breathing that you
would<00:04:25.539> be<00:04:25.659> able<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.900> use<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.409> don't<00:04:26.740> think<00:04:26.979> so<00:04:27.220> no

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
would be able to use I don't think so no

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.219 
would be able to use I don't think so no
I<00:04:27.520> think<00:04:27.789> for<00:04:28.120> humans<00:04:28.509> it's<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:29.080> know<00:04:29.199> it's

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
I think for humans it's you know it's

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.499 
I think for humans it's you know it's
all<00:04:29.500> about<00:04:29.680> them<00:04:30.009> cuz<00:04:30.460> they're<00:04:30.669> I<00:04:30.909> mean<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.389> has

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
all about them cuz they're I mean it has

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.379 
all about them cuz they're I mean it has
to<00:04:31.569> be<00:04:31.750> sort<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.050> large<00:04:32.259> in<00:04:32.590> order<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:34.360> know

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
to be sort of large in order to you know

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.659

have<00:04:34.629> sound<00:04:34.870> bounce<00:04:35.050> off<00:04:35.289> of<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:36.039> what<00:04:36.550> other

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
have sound bounce off of you what other

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.240 
have sound bounce off of you what other
senses<00:04:37.120> would<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.419> use<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.919> kind<00:04:39.159> of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
senses would you use in that kind of

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.890 
senses would you use in that kind of
situation<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:40.030> kind<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.270> get<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.449> sense<00:04:40.539> of

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
situation to kind of get a sense of

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.540 
situation to kind of get a sense of
what's<00:04:41.139> around<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.590> in<00:04:41.710> your<00:04:41.830> environment<00:04:42.039> um

what's around you in your environment um

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.240 
what's around you in your environment um
touch<00:04:43.150> really<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.629> important<00:04:44.169> because<00:04:44.289> you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
touch really is important because you

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.710 
touch really is important because you
know<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.430> were<00:04:45.610> talking<00:04:45.909> about<00:04:45.970> could<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.419> tell

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
know you were talking about could I tell

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.540 
know you were talking about could I tell
if<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.930> was<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.080> human<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.650> let's<00:04:47.860> say<00:04:48.039> I'm<00:04:48.280> like

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
if it was a human so let's say I'm like

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.309 
if it was a human so let's say I'm like
there's<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.819> human<00:04:49.090> or<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.389> post<00:04:49.659> next<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.110> me<00:04:50.229> and

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
there's a human or a post next to me and

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.619 
there's a human or a post next to me and
I'm<00:04:50.440> not<00:04:50.470> quite<00:04:50.770> sure<00:04:50.800> what<00:04:51.129> it<00:04:51.220> is<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.599> we

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
I'm not quite sure what it is so can we

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.059 
I'm not quite sure what it is so can we
just<00:04:52.930> eat<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.169> maybe<00:04:53.319> tap<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.770> with<00:04:53.860> my<00:04:54.039> stick

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
just eat up maybe tap it with my stick

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.800 
just eat up maybe tap it with my stick
and<00:04:54.490> like<00:04:54.940> if<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.150> answered<00:04:55.419> back<00:04:55.599> I'd

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
and like if it answered back I'd

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.450 
and like if it answered back I'd
probably<00:04:55.960> know<00:04:56.199> was<00:04:56.349> a<00:04:56.379> cube<00:04:59.159> that's<00:05:00.159> great

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
probably know was a cube that's great

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.369 
probably know was a cube that's great
what<00:05:01.090> kind<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.330> environments<00:05:01.960> would<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.199> say

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
what kind of environments would you say

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.499 
what kind of environments would you say
echo<00:05:02.590> location<00:05:02.949> is<00:05:03.219> most<00:05:03.430> valuable<00:05:03.879> in<00:05:04.060> so

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
echo location is most valuable in so

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.270 
echo location is most valuable in so
let's<00:05:04.719> say<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:04.990> tell<00:05:05.469> me<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.860> meet<00:05:06.069> you

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
let's say you tell me to meet you

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.459 
let's say you tell me to meet you
someplace<00:05:06.550> for<00:05:06.729> lunch<00:05:07.090> right<00:05:07.419> so<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:07.810> say<00:05:08.199> you

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
someplace for lunch right so you say you

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.200 
someplace for lunch right so you say you
know<00:05:08.590> now<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.250> go<00:05:09.430> down<00:05:09.580> this<00:05:09.729> street<00:05:09.969> here

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
know now you go down this street here

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.850 
know now you go down this street here
and<00:05:10.449> at<00:05:10.659> the<00:05:10.780> light<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.139> want<00:05:11.319> to<00:05:11.379> cross<00:05:11.590> and

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
and at the light you want to cross and

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.529 
and at the light you want to cross and
then<00:05:11.979> it's<00:05:12.129> going<00:05:12.219> to<00:05:12.310> be<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.430> third<00:05:12.849> place<00:05:13.300> on

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
then it's going to be a third place on

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.619 
then it's going to be a third place on
the<00:05:13.659> left<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.710> could<00:05:15.129> tell<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:16.210> know<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.360> can

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
the left so I could tell you know I can

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.809 
the left so I could tell you know I can
hear<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.379> difference<00:05:17.800> between<00:05:18.699> whether

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
hear the the difference between whether

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.249 
hear the the difference between whether
there's<00:05:19.120> like<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.330> store<00:05:19.690> next<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:19.990> me<00:05:20.080> or<00:05:20.229> a

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
there's like a store next to me or a

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.469 
there's like a store next to me or a
doorway<00:05:20.590> now<00:05:21.129> I<00:05:21.159> haven't<00:05:21.490> played<00:05:21.819> the<00:05:22.090> last<00:05:22.270> of

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
doorway now I haven't played the last of

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.240 
doorway now I haven't played the last of
us<00:05:22.569> just<00:05:23.020> yet<00:05:23.319> i<00:05:23.349> know<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.590> lot<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.830> my<00:05:24.039> friends

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
us just yet i know a lot of my friends

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.159 
us just yet i know a lot of my friends
have<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.969> it<00:05:25.060> seems<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.659> zombies<00:05:26.020> in

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
have and it seems like the zombies in

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.510 
have and it seems like the zombies in
that<00:05:26.319> game<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.800> know<00:05:26.889> they<00:05:27.009> definitely<00:05:27.310> use

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
that game you know they definitely use

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.519 
that game you know they definitely use
echolocation<00:05:27.819> to<00:05:28.270> get<00:05:28.479> around<00:05:28.690> do<00:05:29.289> you<00:05:29.349> think

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
echolocation to get around do you think

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.559 
echolocation to get around do you think
that's<00:05:29.680> something<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:30.250> typical<00:05:30.969> zombie<00:05:31.150> would

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
that's something a typical zombie would

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.019 
that's something a typical zombie would
be<00:05:31.690> able<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:32.050> do<00:05:32.319> or<00:05:32.770> is<00:05:33.039> that<00:05:33.310> you<00:05:33.729> know<00:05:33.849> once

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
be able to do or is that you know once

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.459 
be able to do or is that you know once
you<00:05:34.120> kind<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.419> go<00:05:34.569> down<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.020> zombification

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
you kind of go down the zombification

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.120 
you kind of go down the zombification
path<00:05:36.159> perhaps<00:05:36.789> you're<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:38.229> unaware<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:39.039> the

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
path perhaps you're so unaware of the

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.559 
path perhaps you're so unaware of the
rest<00:05:39.310> of<00:05:39.460> your<00:05:39.550> senses<00:05:40.000> other<00:05:40.210> than<00:05:40.389> that

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
rest of your senses other than that

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.659 
rest of your senses other than that
undying<00:05:41.080> thirst<00:05:41.529> for<00:05:41.800> human<00:05:41.860> flesh<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
undying thirst for human flesh and

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.370 
undying thirst for human flesh and
brains<00:05:42.909> that<00:05:43.659> maybe<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.050> wouldn't<00:05:44.229> be<00:05:44.319> able

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
brains that maybe you wouldn't be able

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.689 
brains that maybe you wouldn't be able
to<00:05:44.529> focus<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.009> much<00:05:45.159> on<00:05:45.279> the<00:05:45.400> echolocation

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
to focus so much on the echolocation

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.120 
to focus so much on the echolocation
part<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.599> know<00:05:46.719> I<00:05:46.750> think<00:05:46.990> because<00:05:47.710> well<00:05:48.009> the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
part you know I think because well the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.680 
part you know I think because well the
way<00:05:48.219> you<00:05:48.279> put<00:05:48.550> it<00:05:48.610> there<00:05:48.880> i<00:05:48.909> mean<00:05:49.120> i<00:05:49.180> think<00:05:49.360> that

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
way you put it there i mean i think that

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.330 
way you put it there i mean i think that
that<00:05:49.719> thirst<00:05:50.440> for<00:05:50.650> human<00:05:50.710> flesh<00:05:51.069> and

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
that thirst for human flesh and

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.510 
that thirst for human flesh and
everything<00:05:51.669> would<00:05:52.150> just<00:05:52.180> be<00:05:52.449> overpowering<00:05:53.050> so

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
everything would just be overpowering so

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.589 
everything would just be overpowering so
you<00:05:54.520> know<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:54.789> would<00:05:54.879> be<00:05:54.969> your<00:05:55.090> main<00:05:55.270> focus

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
you know that would be your main focus

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.269 
you know that would be your main focus
so<00:05:56.020> no<00:05:56.409> I<00:05:56.440> don't<00:05:56.800> think<00:05:56.860> you'd<00:05:57.039> be<00:05:57.129> paying

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
so no I don't think you'd be paying

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.519 
so no I don't think you'd be paying
attention<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.849> much<00:05:58.029> else<00:05:58.270> right<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.409> be

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
attention to much else right you be

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.200 
attention to much else right you be
motivated<00:06:00.039> by<00:06:00.069> oh<00:06:00.250> my<00:06:00.460> god<00:06:00.639> there's<00:06:00.879> human

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
around human ring me human so I'm gonna

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.209 
around human ring me human so I'm gonna
guess<00:06:05.620> that<00:06:05.650> so<00:06:06.520> in<00:06:06.699> real<00:06:06.969> life<00:06:07.270> humans<00:06:08.219> with

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
guess that so in real life humans with

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.490 
guess that so in real life humans with
full<00:06:09.460> faculty<00:06:09.969> of<00:06:10.120> all<00:06:10.419> their<00:06:10.569> other<00:06:10.690> or<00:06:11.050> most

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
full faculty of all their other or most

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.709 
full faculty of all their other or most
of<00:06:11.620> their<00:06:11.740> senses<00:06:12.190> can<00:06:12.460> use<00:06:12.669> echolocation<00:06:13.029> to

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
of their senses can use echolocation to

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.659 
of their senses can use echolocation to
to<00:06:14.199> get<00:06:14.349> around<00:06:14.560> especially<00:06:14.860> if<00:06:15.250> it<00:06:15.340> if<00:06:15.520> it's

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
to get around especially if it if it's

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.490 
to get around especially if it if it's
heightened<00:06:16.029> I'll<00:06:16.449> put<00:06:16.659> it<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.779> you<00:06:16.900> this<00:06:16.960> way<00:06:17.229> I

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
heightened I'll put it to you this way I

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.260 
heightened I'll put it to you this way I
wouldn't<00:06:17.979> trade<00:06:18.129> my<00:06:18.190> stick<00:06:18.550> for<00:06:18.789> it<00:06:18.909> you<00:06:19.150> know

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
wouldn't trade my stick for it you know

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.519 
wouldn't trade my stick for it you know
I<00:06:19.300> me<00:06:19.479> and<00:06:19.539> I<00:06:19.629> much<00:06:19.779> rather<00:06:19.930> walk<00:06:20.169> around<00:06:20.440> with

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
I me and I much rather walk around with

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.439 
I me and I much rather walk around with
a<00:06:20.590> cane<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:21.009> no<00:06:21.190> echo<00:06:21.520> location<00:06:21.969> or<00:06:22.240> fifth

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
a cane and no echo location or fifth

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.570 
a cane and no echo location or fifth
sense<00:06:22.690> then<00:06:23.349> walk<00:06:23.620> around<00:06:23.860> with<00:06:24.009> echolocation

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
sense then walk around with echolocation

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.730 
sense then walk around with echolocation
or<00:06:25.120> fifth<00:06:25.300> sense<00:06:25.509> and<00:06:25.690> no<00:06:25.779> cane<00:06:26.020> gotcha<00:06:26.469> that

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
or fifth sense and no cane gotcha that

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.129 
or fifth sense and no cane gotcha that
make<00:06:26.889> sense<00:06:27.039> yes<00:06:27.490> absolutely<00:06:27.849> it<00:06:28.810> seems<00:06:29.050> like

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
make sense yes absolutely it seems like

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.800 
make sense yes absolutely it seems like
zombies<00:06:29.680> perhaps<00:06:30.099> would<00:06:30.490> not<00:06:30.969> typically<00:06:31.479> be

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
zombies perhaps would not typically be

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.810 
zombies perhaps would not typically be
very<00:06:32.020> good<00:06:32.259> at<00:06:32.409> using<00:06:32.529> echolocation<00:06:32.949> outside

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
very good at using echolocation outside

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.909 
very good at using echolocation outside
of<00:06:33.969> the<00:06:34.029> fictional<00:06:34.449> realm<00:06:34.659> no<00:06:35.020> yeah<00:06:35.440> get<00:06:35.889> a

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
of the fictional realm no yeah get a

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.350 
of the fictional realm no yeah get a
cane<00:06:36.190> zombies<00:06:36.699> it's<00:06:37.060> fun

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
cane zombies it's fun

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.670 
cane zombies it's fun
and<00:06:37.449> then<00:06:37.599> you<00:06:37.719> can<00:06:37.870> probably<00:06:38.080> ride<00:06:38.259> the<00:06:38.439> train

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
and then you can probably ride the train

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.080 
and then you can probably ride the train
for<00:06:38.860> half<00:06:39.009> price<00:06:41.310> so<00:06:42.310> overall<00:06:42.550> I'm<00:06:42.849> going<00:06:43.030> to

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
for half price so overall I'm going to

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.990 
for half price so overall I'm going to
say<00:06:43.270> that<00:06:43.810> echo<00:06:43.990> location<00:06:44.379> is<00:06:44.800> fact<00:06:45.219> I<00:06:45.580> mean<00:06:45.849> it

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
say that echo location is fact I mean it

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.089 
say that echo location is fact I mean it
is<00:06:46.120> a<00:06:46.150> real<00:06:46.389> thing<00:06:46.659> and<00:06:46.960> even<00:06:47.199> humans<00:06:47.590> can<00:06:47.860> use

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099 
is a real thing and even humans can use

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:49.879 
is a real thing and even humans can use
it<00:06:48.280> to<00:06:48.400> some<00:06:48.580> effect<00:06:48.939> but<00:06:49.419> it's<00:06:49.599> probably

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
it to some effect but it's probably

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.830 
it to some effect but it's probably
fictional<00:06:50.889> for<00:06:51.069> zombies<00:06:51.400> yeah<00:06:51.909> I<00:06:52.240> go<00:06:52.689> with

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
out there in the world use echolocation

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.050 
out there in the world use echolocation
and<00:07:19.360> though<00:07:19.840> humans<00:07:20.319> are<00:07:20.770> not<00:07:20.919> great<00:07:21.310> at<00:07:21.550> it<00:07:21.729> we

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
and though humans are not great at it we

said<00:07:26.050> zombies<00:07:26.919> I<00:07:27.159> think<00:07:27.400> they<00:07:27.550> they<00:07:27.849> have<00:07:27.969> lost

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 
said zombies I think they they have lost

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.689 
said zombies I think they they have lost
some<00:07:28.449> of<00:07:28.479> their<00:07:28.779> their<00:07:29.259> faculties<00:07:29.860> in<00:07:30.219> in<00:07:30.520> that

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:30.699 
some of their their faculties in in that

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
regard I think they are pretty much just

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.980 
regard I think they are pretty much just
motivated<00:07:33.340> by<00:07:33.490> that<00:07:33.789> that<00:07:34.270> hunger<00:07:34.750> that
