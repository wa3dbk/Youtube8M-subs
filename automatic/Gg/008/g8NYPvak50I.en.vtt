00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
 Here we go! Tamagotchi! 

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.116
 Yah-tchi! 

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:15.016
 Kuromametchi is SO popular ?! 

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.586
 Bye, Mrs. Perfect! 

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.846
 Hello children, see you soon! Haha! 

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:26.046
 Can you all come to the Tamagotchi department store? 

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:29.386
 A very popular band is playing tonight! 

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.016
 Okay, that sounds nice. 

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:33.486
 If Mametchi goes, we go too. 

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.016
 We're going too, oh yeah, yeah, yeah! 

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:39.186
 Hey? 

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:41.986
 Hey, Kuromametchi, do you want to come too? 

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.716
 No thanks. 

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:47.216
 He's such a loner. 

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:50.686
 But that makes him so cool! 

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.486
 He is also very smart. 

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.616
 And very good at sports. 

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.786
 Ah! What if he thinks we're not cool enough to hang out with him ?! 

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:02.386
 Mametchi is cool enough ... He is even your biggest rival, isn't he? 

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:06.886
 Not really a rival. I consider him more like a friend. 

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:16.286
 Yo, Ciaotchi. 

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.246
 What do you want now, Bikertchi? 

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.716
 There is something very important that I want to talk to you about. 

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:25.246
 I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. 

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.116
 Ciao. 

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.246
 You don't have to be in such a hurry. 

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.486
 What do you mean, right? 

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:34.986
 Well, you know ... 

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.546
 Au, au, au, au, au! 

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.286
 What do you think you're doing, Kuromametchi? 

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:43.046
 Thanks for your help. 

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:46.886
 Wait, Ciaotchi, come back ... 

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.386
 Au, au, au, au! 

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.686
 It's his. 

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:09.446
 Uh ... sorry for the misunderstanding, Bikertchi. 

00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:15.116
 My love letter! 

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:21.816
 She is reading him! Finally! Thank you, Kuromamet. Kuromametchi? 

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:24.586
 Wait a minute, where did he go ?! Kuromametchi? 

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:28.946
 I owe you! 

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:33.516
 If you ever need anything, let me know, okay? 

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:36.846
 Apparently he has a new groupie. 

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:40.846
 Kuromametchi is so cool, even boys want to do everything to hang out with him!
