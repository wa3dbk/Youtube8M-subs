00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.990 
they did not have the cleaning clear
toner<00:04:43.860> when<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.100> went<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.520> store<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.820> get<00:04:44.940> it

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
so I had to settle for the equate brand

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.400 
so I had to settle for the equate brand
which<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.310> not<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.850> big<00:04:48.060> deal<00:04:48.240> it's<00:04:48.540> pretty<00:04:49.260> much

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
which is not a big deal it's pretty much

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.050 
which is not a big deal it's pretty much
the<00:04:49.560> same<00:04:49.740> thing<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.760> little<00:04:50.880> bit

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
the same thing and it's a little bit

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.660 
the same thing and it's a little bit
cheaper<00:04:51.270> so<00:04:51.750> that's<00:04:52.200> always<00:04:52.470> good<00:04:52.740> then<00:04:53.550> I'm

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
cheaper so that's always good then I'm

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.600
