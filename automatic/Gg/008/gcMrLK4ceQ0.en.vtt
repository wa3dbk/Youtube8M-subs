last fall in 2012 and we're observing

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.820 
last fall in 2012 and we're observing
adult<00:00:20.760> steelhead<00:00:21.390> returning<00:00:22.109> from<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> ocean

adult steelhead returning from the ocean

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.019 
adult steelhead returning from the ocean
and<00:00:23.510> they're<00:00:24.769> constructing<00:00:25.769> their<00:00:26.099> nests

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and they're constructing their nests

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.290 
and they're constructing their nests
which<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.779> call<00:00:27.990> reds<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.939> they're<00:00:29.939> gonna<00:00:30.029> lay

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
which we call reds and they're gonna lay

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.569 
which we call reds and they're gonna lay
their<00:00:30.480> eggs<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.929> there<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> cover<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.430> over

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
their eggs in there and cover them over

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.970 
their eggs in there and cover them over
and<00:00:33.120> later<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.350> summer<00:00:34.649> they're<00:00:34.890> gonna

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and later on this summer they're gonna

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.940 
and later on this summer they're gonna
hatch<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.670> little<00:00:35.850> babies<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.649> fry<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
hatch out as little babies as fry and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090 
hatch out as little babies as fry and
they're<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.960> rear<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> stream<00:00:40.530> for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
they're going to rear in the stream for

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
they're going to rear in the stream for
one<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> three<00:00:42.210> years<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.809> swim<00:00:43.050> down<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
one to three years and then swim down to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.810 
one to three years and then swim down to
the<00:00:43.500> ocean<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> whole<00:00:44.489> thing<00:00:44.520> over

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the ocean and do the whole thing over

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.560 
the ocean and do the whole thing over
again<00:00:48.020> that's<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> big<00:00:49.289> fish<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.820> shows<00:00:51.329> exactly

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
again that's a big fish it shows exactly

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.520 
again that's a big fish it shows exactly
the<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.770> idea<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:54.300> well<00:00:55.199> thought-out

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the the idea of a well thought-out

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.880 
the the idea of a well thought-out
process<00:00:56.059> that<00:00:57.059> puts<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> habitat<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.739> we

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
process that puts the habitat in that we

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.819 
process that puts the habitat in that we
know<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.309> fish<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.750> build<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> then

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
know that fish like to build it and then

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
know that fish like to build it and then
the<00:01:02.039> following<00:01:02.550> spring<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.359> adult

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the following spring to have adult

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.469 
the following spring to have adult
steelhead<00:01:04.229> come<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:06.210> very

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
steelhead come in and use it it's very

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.170 
steelhead come in and use it it's very
satisfying<00:01:06.799> yeah<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> partners<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
where it didn't work in the past it's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.830 
where it didn't work in the past it's
working<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:19.729> yeah<00:01:20.729> well<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> Yankee<00:01:21.450> Fork<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
working now yeah well the Yankee Fork of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.679 
working now yeah well the Yankee Fork of
the<00:01:21.900> Salmon<00:01:22.170> River<00:01:22.350> has<00:01:22.950> had<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.790> lot<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the Salmon River has had a lot of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.039 
the Salmon River has had a lot of
impacts<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.100> from<00:01:27.090> mostly<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.750> dredge

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
impacts to it from mostly from dredge

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.179 
impacts to it from mostly from dredge
mining<00:01:28.490> earlier<00:01:29.990> 50<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:32.090> 60<00:01:33.090> years<00:01:33.210> ago<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
mining earlier 50 to 60 years ago and it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
mining earlier 50 to 60 years ago and it
disrupted<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.090> fish<00:01:36.390> habitat<00:01:36.930> quite<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> bit

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
disrupted the fish habitat quite a bit

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.700 
disrupted the fish habitat quite a bit
and<00:01:38.420> many<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> partners<00:01:39.990> including<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and many of the partners including the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
and many of the partners including the
Shoshone<00:01:41.250> Bannock<00:01:41.280> tribes<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.540> been<00:01:42.659> trying

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
Shoshone Bannock tribes have been trying

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
Shoshone Bannock tribes have been trying
to<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.530> some<00:01:44.210> rehabilitation<00:01:45.210> work<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.630> there

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to do some rehabilitation work in there

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.030 
to do some rehabilitation work in there
for<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.409> past<00:01:46.590> 25<00:01:47.250> years<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.140> we<00:01:49.140> finally<00:01:49.380> got

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
for the past 25 years and we finally got

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.580 
for the past 25 years and we finally got
a<00:01:50.100> significant<00:01:50.880> project<00:01:51.420> done<00:01:51.979> last<00:01:52.979> fall<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
a significant project done last fall to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
a significant project done last fall to
to<00:01:55.590> start<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.130> process<00:01:56.189> we're<00:01:57.149> hoping<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> do

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
to start that process we're hoping to do

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
to start that process we're hoping to do
another<00:01:58.020> series<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> projects<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> improve

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
another series of projects to improve

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:00.550 
another series of projects to improve
have

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
have

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.219 
have
sat<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.890> there<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.299> first<00:02:02.659> project<00:02:02.930> that

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
sat in there so this first project that

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.050 
sat in there so this first project that
we<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:03.560> finished<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:04.310> exciting<00:02:04.939> because

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
we just finished is exciting because

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.810 
we just finished is exciting because
it's<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.380> first<00:02:06.649> step<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.399> fish<00:02:07.640> are

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
it's the first step and the fish are

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.240 
it's the first step and the fish are
already<00:02:08.209> using<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.259> we're<00:02:09.440> expecting<00:02:10.099> the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
already using it and we're expecting the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.130 
already using it and we're expecting the
future<00:02:10.700> projects<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.599> next<00:02:11.750> five<00:02:12.110> years

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
future projects in the next five years

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.479 
future projects in the next five years
to<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:13.010> even<00:02:13.280> bigger<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.780> used<00:02:15.200> even

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to be even bigger and to be used even

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.509 
to be even bigger and to be used even
more<00:02:16.489> by<00:02:17.349> steelhead<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.590> chinook<00:02:18.709> salmon
