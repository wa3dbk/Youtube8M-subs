board games okay that's not really true

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.230 
board games okay that's not really true
maybe<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> beginning<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> series

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
maybe in the beginning of the series

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.759 
maybe in the beginning of the series
that<00:00:24.419> was<00:00:24.509> a<00:00:24.570> true<00:00:24.839> statement<00:00:25.079> but<00:00:25.499> as<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that was a true statement but as the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.529 
that was a true statement but as the
games<00:00:26.009> have<00:00:26.189> been<00:00:26.220> dragging<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.939> they've<00:00:27.359> been

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
games have been dragging on they've been

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.569 
games have been dragging on they've been
bringing<00:00:27.749> in<00:00:28.019> lesser-known<00:00:28.470> spin-offs<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
bringing in lesser-known spin-offs of

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.460 
bringing in lesser-known spin-offs of
great<00:00:29.880> games<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.689> time<00:00:30.960> they're<00:00:31.289> all

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
great games this time they're all

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
great games this time they're all
tweaked<00:00:31.859> versions<00:00:32.400> of<00:00:32.550> classic<00:00:32.700> games<00:00:33.239> most

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
tweaked versions of classic games most

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
tweaked versions of classic games most
the<00:00:33.900> time<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> can't<00:00:34.500> stand<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.160> they<00:00:35.310> stray

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the time I can't stand when they stray

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
the time I can't stand when they stray
from<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> formula<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> makes<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> original

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
from the formula that makes the original

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.930 
from the formula that makes the original
game<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.530> great<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.130> these<00:00:38.220> spin-off<00:00:38.640> games

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
game so great but these spin-off games

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
game so great but these spin-off games
were<00:00:39.150> actually<00:00:39.690> tolerable<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.740> it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
were actually tolerable I think it's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.680 
were actually tolerable I think it's
because<00:00:41.130> it's<00:00:41.310> a<00:00:41.400> video<00:00:41.550> game<00:00:41.700> version<00:00:41.970> of<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
because it's a video game version of a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.240 
because it's a video game version of a
real-life<00:00:43.110> game<00:00:43.440> show<00:00:43.740> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.980> same<00:00:44.190> name

without the for of course cuz that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.620 
without the for of course cuz that
wouldn't<00:00:47.070> make<00:00:47.190> any<00:00:47.340> sense<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:48.090> airs<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.510> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this one so much I just thought it was

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.720 
this one so much I just thought it was
clever<00:02:13.049> it's<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:13.830> rolling<00:02:14.069> dice<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.640> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
clever it's just rolling dice in a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.760 
clever it's just rolling dice in a
creative<00:02:15.030> way<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.810> roll<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> bowling<00:02:16.500> ball

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
creative way now you roll a bowling ball

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.920 
creative way now you roll a bowling ball
down<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.069> lane<00:02:17.370> towards<00:02:17.790> five<00:02:18.120> pins<00:02:18.450> you'll

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
down a lane towards five pins you'll

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.230 
down a lane towards five pins you'll
knock<00:02:19.140> each<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.500> them<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:19.770> every

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
knock each of them down every

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.910 
knock each of them down every

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and where the pins land will tell you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.440 
and where the pins land will tell you
which<00:02:22.070> number<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.460> have<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.730> work<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.210> you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
see each of these pins are six-sided so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.160 
see each of these pins are six-sided so
we<00:02:25.550> don't<00:02:25.700> land<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.090> one<00:02:26.270> side<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.050> you

duh Kinect for basketball as lame as it

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.160 
duh Kinect for basketball as lame as it
sounds<00:02:52.550> it's<00:02:52.730> really<00:02:53.090> not<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.330> bad<00:02:53.750> and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
sounds it's really not that bad and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.780 
sounds it's really not that bad and
could<00:02:54.410> actually<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.830> fun<00:02:55.040> if<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.400> controls

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
could actually be fun if the controls

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.770 
could actually be fun if the controls
were<00:02:55.940> actually<00:02:56.270> good

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
were actually good

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.480 
were actually good
unfortunately<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.590> controls<00:02:58.010> would<00:02:58.130> often

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
unfortunately the controls would often

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.130 
unfortunately the controls would often
miss<00:02:58.640> read<00:02:58.880> my<00:02:59.060> moves<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.660> would<00:02:59.840> have<00:02:59.990> me

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
miss read my moves I would have me

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.840 
miss read my moves I would have me
saying<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.590> was<00:03:00.620> shooting<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> wrong<00:03:01.460> area

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
saying I was shooting in the wrong area

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.000 
saying I was shooting in the wrong area
if<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.450> controls<00:03:02.840> work<00:03:03.050> more<00:03:03.230> reliably<00:03:03.800> it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
if the controls work more reliably it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.710 
if the controls work more reliably it
would<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.280> higher<00:03:04.520> up<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.940> my<00:03:05.060> opinions<00:03:05.570> of

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
would be higher up on my opinions of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.270 
would be higher up on my opinions of
these<00:03:05.840> games<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.530> game<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.830> play<00:03:07.040> glide

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
for the Game Show wasn't bad after the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.590 
for the Game Show wasn't bad after the
last<00:04:28.520> game<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.880> thought<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.210> series<00:04:29.570> just

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
last game I thought the series just

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600 
last game I thought the series just
really<00:04:30.140> going<00:04:30.410> downhill<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.340> thought<00:04:31.460> it

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
really going downhill and I thought it

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.320 
really going downhill and I thought it
was<00:04:31.669> nice<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:31.910> they

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
was nice that they

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.540 
was nice that they
I<00:04:32.360> found<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.810> way<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:32.990> keep<00:04:33.199> it<00:04:33.379> okay<00:04:33.770> now<00:04:34.400> these

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
I found a way to keep it okay now these

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.309 
I found a way to keep it okay now these
games<00:04:34.789> are<00:04:35.000> clearly<00:04:35.389> targeted<00:04:35.900> for<00:04:36.110> younger

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319
