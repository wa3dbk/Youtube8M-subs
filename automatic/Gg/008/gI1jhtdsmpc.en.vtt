00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
keep try and keep a consistent pressure

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.129 
keep try and keep a consistent pressure

you<00:03:42.719> can<00:03:42.900> see<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.790> we<00:03:44.999> have<00:03:45.299> an<00:03:45.629> icord<00:03:46.560> edge

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
you can see that we have an icord edge

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.750 
you can see that we have an icord edge
is<00:03:47.599> there<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.049> want<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.409> skinnier<00:03:50.099> you

is there and if you want it skinnier you
can<00:03:50.909> go<00:03:51.060> down<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.480> smaller<00:03:51.870> needle<00:03:52.230> size<00:03:52.620> you

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
can go down a smaller needle size you

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.030 
can go down a smaller needle size you
could<00:03:53.639> do<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.879> in<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.150> contrasting<00:03:54.989> yarn<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
could do it in a contrasting yarn and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.639 
could do it in a contrasting yarn and
that's<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.219> for<00:03:59.370> today
