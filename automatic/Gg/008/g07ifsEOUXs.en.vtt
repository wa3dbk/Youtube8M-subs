00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.440
 Hello I am the protein one each 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.500
 small overview of the bio city ​​as 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.449
 on the protein production the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.940
 individual processes you want to know 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:47.899
 you at any time on the mix 14 counted the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.409
 we set the path and paths for the ft and he 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.809
 died in the form of dr by the 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.809
 Transaction stands the different core 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:12.670
 doctor pitted polymerase from 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:12.670
 two transcribed in a bloodless 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:42.819
 leave now and the pace 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:53.200
 The constellation directly back to one 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 Free hypo takes place 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.390
 upon completion of the transaction 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.390
 a stop course solves that 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.290
 Now, finally, the only 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.290
 information 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:24.560
 whoever needs the cell 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.239
 transcribed or produced that is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:36.709
 it can be several and ernas and 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:39.260
 at the same time the teletrust I hate the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.919
 whole process of biosynthesis again 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.989
 shortly together with 1 the problems race 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.579
 transcribe like various internas 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.799
 out of behavior 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:56.769
 kyra sedgwick with the normal proteins 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.769
 and the tna through 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.120
 according to their work of 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:08.329
 the private circle maps and ikeas 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.889
 the others ultimately determine that 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.090
 protein so today's ideological 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.970
 skill mainly from the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.250
 transaction transaction click on 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.609
 one of the links makes the processes more accurate 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.500
 I hope that I have treated 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.479
 he gives a good overview of this video 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.479
 given the protein synthesis
