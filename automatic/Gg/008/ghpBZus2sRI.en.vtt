00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.289
 castilla and lion 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:11.490
 min 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 in January 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.789
 this is the recipe he paid attention to Genoese 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.759
 it does not carry any kind of nuts simply basil that there is in 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.649
 fourth and then dry it 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.030
 and then they were also not very gay 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.710
 that in this case and until this race was such that in only half a tooth of 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.140
 garlic to which they remove the central part so that it does not repeat 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.720
 wolf also increases up ante antequera and the extra virgin 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 to evolve the basil 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.390
 and a bit of parmesan I as a country have moved everything in the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.390
 north 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.560
 once the battle is titled we add the low environment 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.230
 and the first charreada olive oil we were stirring little by little 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.780
 they also do a little salt and we will continue adding more oil for and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.070
 announcing the text you have to give it well with force as when we make a 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.110
 mayonnaise with the blender but in this case as we do it manually you have to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.090
 give him time art in with the pestle to get excited 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.110
 and I'm going to finally have had the consistent tab we'll go the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.160
 Parmesan 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.680
 i can take a boat and we can store the refrigerators and no problem during 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 three or four days 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.440
 in them
