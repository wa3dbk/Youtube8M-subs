 the south Germans 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.110
 had agreed with krawall after the break 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.990
 but already we have though it was not 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.270

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.090
 I am you an idea 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.890
 put you can also ask some questions outside the parties 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 in times 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.130
 idea 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.100
 but you don't have to do anything anymore with jesse 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.270
 did you say yourself because that is not where i said i am the female 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.640
 play a leading role in the story with the gnomes 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 by the way, what are the other six gnomes what is nothing else 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.820
 you do that you have a player gnome plop with gnome gnash 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.739
 I do not know what 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.129
 be snow white 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.700
 cabout actua do not do ball technique yes but sit there and especially not 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:16.339

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.339
 also drink some warm water in the final 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.019
 is not much later came the fun of a leprechaun lazy europe 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 invaded 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.009
 four women 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.989
 I am running this year 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.839

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.509
 when those reported this Friday do that 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.889
 because most people don't want to be a pirate, we play gnomes and plop 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.709
 the kabouterbaby 2 but I also know that I am they were in that condition 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.079
 with kabouter plop I don't like that 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.860
 I don't think those pirates will be a teacher next year 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.429
 but full full I didn't want it to be achieved 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.609
