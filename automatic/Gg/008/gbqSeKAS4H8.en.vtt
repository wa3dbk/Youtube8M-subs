what<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.570> performance<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.529> considering

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
what a performance you know considering

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
what a performance you know considering
that<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.279> reported<00:00:27.000> long<00:00:27.180> reportedly<00:00:27.810> Bray

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that I reported long reportedly Bray

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.750 
that I reported long reportedly Bray
Wyatt<00:00:28.320> suffered<00:00:28.740> some<00:00:28.890> kind<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.099> ankle<00:00:29.490> injury

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
Wyatt suffered some kind of ankle injury

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.209 
Wyatt suffered some kind of ankle injury
training<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.869> match<00:00:31.080> he<00:00:31.590> suffered<00:00:32.099> some

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
training for this match he suffered some

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
training for this match he suffered some
kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.719> ankle<00:00:33.719> injury<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.050> don't<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
kind of a ankle injury I don't know I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.510 
kind of a ankle injury I don't know I
think<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.590> twisted<00:00:34.890> his<00:00:34.950> ankle<00:00:35.100> before<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
think he twisted his ankle before the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.330 
think he twisted his ankle before the
match<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> greatest

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
match so this was not the greatest

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.950 
match so this was not the greatest
WrestleMania<00:00:38.340> performance<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.300> time<00:00:39.510> but

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
WrestleMania performance of all time but

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
WrestleMania performance of all time but
I<00:00:40.020> felt<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.559> still<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> decent<00:00:41.309> effort

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I felt it was still a decent effort

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.369 
I felt it was still a decent effort
considering<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> Undertaker<00:00:42.660> only<00:00:42.930> wrestles

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
considering the Undertaker only wrestles

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.150 
considering the Undertaker only wrestles
once<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.770> year

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
once a year

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
once a year
considering<00:00:45.000> Bray<00:00:45.180> Wyatt<00:00:45.450> did<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.780> whole

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
considering Bray Wyatt did this whole

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.150 
considering Bray Wyatt did this whole
program<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:46.739> himself

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
program all by himself

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
program all by himself
this<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.870> took<00:00:48.989> me<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this this actually took me on a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.510 
this this actually took me on a
rollercoaster<00:00:49.500> ride<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:50.070> many<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
rollercoaster ride like many of the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
rollercoaster ride like many of the
matches<00:00:50.910> tonight<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.719> built<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.079> emotion

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
matches tonight it was built on emotion

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
matches tonight it was built on emotion
it<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.239> built<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.629> passion<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
