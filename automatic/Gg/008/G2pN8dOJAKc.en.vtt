now the MacBook Air hasn't really

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.570 
now the MacBook Air hasn't really
changed<00:02:57.690> much<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> past<00:02:59.100> couple<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
changed much for the past couple of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.850 
changed much for the past couple of
years<00:02:59.640> in<00:03:00.120> fact<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.720> latest<00:03:00.900> iteration<00:03:01.260> is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
years in fact the latest iteration is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.130 
years in fact the latest iteration is
just<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.340> small<00:03:02.700> upgrade<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.450> terms<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
just a small upgrade in terms of the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.900 
just a small upgrade in terms of the
internal<00:03:04.590> capabilities<00:03:05.280> when<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.550> comes<00:03:05.730> to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
internal capabilities when it comes to

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.260 
internal capabilities when it comes to
the<00:03:06.000> CPU<00:03:06.770> performance<00:03:07.770> as<00:03:07.890> well<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
the CPU performance as well as the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.300 
the CPU performance as well as the
internal<00:03:09.270> SSD<00:03:09.660> speeds<00:03:10.260> but<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.130> it's

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
internal SSD speeds but on that it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.740 
internal SSD speeds but on that it's
pretty<00:03:11.490> much<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.760> same<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.600> previous

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
pretty much the same as the previous

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.830 
pretty much the same as the previous
generations<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.250> has<00:03:14.550> really<00:03:14.940> kept<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
generations but what has really kept the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.230 
generations but what has really kept the
value<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.710> air<00:03:16.860> going<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.880> one<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.150> the

value of the air going and one of the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.730 
value of the air going and one of the
things<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.600> really<00:03:19.080> love<00:03:19.260> about<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.620> is

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
things that I really love about it is

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.500 
things that I really love about it is
the<00:03:20.160> fact<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.490> it's<00:03:20.640> still<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.000> king<00:03:21.300> of

brand-new capacitive touch trackpad so

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.890 
brand-new capacitive touch trackpad so
there's<00:04:05.040> no<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:05.700> mechanics<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:06.750> it's

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
there's no more mechanics in there it's

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.200 
there's no more mechanics in there it's
the<00:04:07.020> exact<00:04:07.350> same<00:04:07.380> trackpad<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.580> we<00:04:08.730> see<00:04:08.970> in

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
the exact same trackpad that we see in

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.630 
the exact same trackpad that we see in
that<00:04:09.390> new<00:04:09.660> MacBook<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.950> fact<00:04:11.160> when<00:04:11.610> it

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
that new MacBook and in fact when it

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.610 
that new MacBook and in fact when it
comes<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.330> new<00:04:12.480> MacBook<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.170> think

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
comes to the new MacBook I think

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.600

the<00:04:15.090> MacBook<00:04:15.720> Pro<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:15.960> probably<00:04:16.590> one<00:04:16.830> of<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
the MacBook Pro is probably one of the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.550 
the MacBook Pro is probably one of the
best<00:04:17.250> computers<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.060> can<00:04:18.180> get<00:04:18.359> from<00:04:19.020> Apple

best computers you can get from Apple

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.200 
best computers you can get from Apple
certainly<00:04:20.040> when<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.280> comes<00:04:20.460> to<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.760> internal

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
certainly when it comes to the internal

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.750 
certainly when it comes to the internal
specifications<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:22.380> display<00:04:22.860> configuration

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760

and the overall battery performance and

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.540 
and the overall battery performance and
now

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
now

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.089 
now
with<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.759> new<00:04:26.940> version<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.750> also<00:04:28.080> get<00:04:28.470> up<00:04:28.860> to

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
with the new version you also get up to

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.640 
with the new version you also get up to
ten<00:04:29.400> hours<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.849> real<00:04:30.569> life<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:31.139> web<00:04:31.349> browsing

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
ten hours of real life a web browsing

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.249 
ten hours of real life a web browsing
and<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.099> almost<00:04:32.280> got<00:04:32.580> 11<00:04:33.210> hours<00:04:33.599> of<00:04:33.720> web

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
and I almost got 11 hours of web

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.170 
and I almost got 11 hours of web
browsing<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.039> really<00:04:35.250> getting<00:04:35.639> close<00:04:35.909> to

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
what the MacBook Air can do maybe not

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.580 
what the MacBook Air can do maybe not
quite<00:04:38.940> as<00:04:39.240> good<00:04:39.509> as<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.930> air<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.349> you<00:04:40.379> also

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
quite as good as the air but you also

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.990 
quite as good as the air but you also
have<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.889> consider<00:04:41.069> that<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.490> comes<00:04:41.699> with<00:04:41.849> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
have to consider that it comes with that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.990

amazing IPS Retina display as well as
much<00:04:45.629> faster<00:04:46.080> internal<00:04:46.590> specifications<00:04:46.830> now

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
much faster internal specifications now

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.040 
much faster internal specifications now

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
traditionally it really does hold its

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:09.170 
traditionally it really does hold its
value

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
value

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.270 
value
way<00:05:09.780> better<00:05:09.990> than<00:05:10.169> pretty<00:05:10.590> much<00:05:10.680> all<00:05:10.949> of<00:05:11.009> the

fester<00:05:18.240> than<00:05:18.750> what<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:18.960> find<00:05:19.349> a<00:05:19.500> MacBook<00:05:19.949> Pro<00:05:19.979> or

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
fester than what I find a MacBook Pro or

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.249

MacBook Air does now I'm not saying that

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.899 
MacBook Air does now I'm not saying that
you<00:05:22.349> should<00:05:22.530> go<00:05:22.710> out<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.099> buy<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> MacBook<00:05:23.879> Pro

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
you should go out and buy a MacBook Pro

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.670 
you should go out and buy a MacBook Pro
strictly<00:05:24.539> because<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:24.960> holds<00:05:25.199> its<00:05:25.590> value

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
strictly because it holds its value

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.740 
strictly because it holds its value

its<00:05:34.259> value<00:05:34.319> and<00:05:35.039> you<00:05:35.460> can<00:05:35.639> keep<00:05:35.880> that

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
its value and you can keep that

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.820 
its value and you can keep that
investment<00:05:36.690> for<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:36.870> longer<00:05:37.259> period<00:05:37.319> of<00:05:37.770> time
