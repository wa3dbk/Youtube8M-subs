00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
right and display same glass back but

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
right and display same glass back but
it's<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.390> new<00:00:21.810> internal<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.619> saw<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's all new internal so we saw that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.890 
it's all new internal so we saw that
dual-core<00:00:23.430> a5<00:00:23.490> processor<00:00:24.060> dual<00:00:24.630> core

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
dual-core a5 processor dual core

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.420 
dual-core a5 processor dual core
graphics<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.800> that's<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> lead<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
graphics so that's going to lead to a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.670 
graphics so that's going to lead to a
two<00:00:26.580> times<00:00:26.970> faster<00:00:27.570> cpu<00:00:27.990> seven<00:00:28.289> times<00:00:28.470> faster

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
two times faster cpu seven times faster

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
two times faster cpu seven times faster
graphics<00:00:29.070> we're<00:00:29.939> gonna<00:00:30.029> get<00:00:30.179> eight<00:00:30.330> hours<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
graphics we're gonna get eight hours of

graphics we're gonna get eight hours of
talk<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.679> 3g<00:00:32.130> only<00:00:32.489> confirming
