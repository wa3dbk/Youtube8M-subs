00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.230
 Novosibirsk neurosurgeons conducted 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.850
 six-year unique patient operation 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.710
 boy diagnosed with hydrocephalus 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.749
 congenital ailment and car accident 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910
 led to an abnormal enlargement of the skull 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.889
 up to 1 meter in girth is the hardest 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.139
 a similar case in the practice of Novosibirsk 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 specialists the first phase of the operation took 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.980
 20 hours the doctors worked for two days 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 Now the child is animating and the doctors 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 wondering why the kid got on 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.779
 operating table so late on 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.529
 the hardest stage of the disease 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 Details in the plot of July Fedoseeva 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.400
 a six year old Roma doesn't get out of bed and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.690
 for several years I have not walked on the street 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.320
 skirting his skull ninety nine 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.690
 centimeters 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.160
 congenital disease hydrocephalus 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.270
 progresses rapidly and beyond 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.399
 received five years ago 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.530
 brain injury is huge 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.710
 amount of highly stressed fluid 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 enclosed 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.920
 skull way outflow of fluid in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.219
 This particular case has 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.359
 there is no child and water to such an extent 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.019
 accumulates and head to be 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.040
 more clearly inflated to such an extent that 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.590
 baby periodically 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.869
 this liquid breaks through the eyes and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.759
 through the nose of Novosibirsk and doctors 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.619
 perplexed as the child could somewhat 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.270
 years to live in this state but 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.250
 Siberian Center for Neurosurgery boy 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 got from the village near Omsk little rum 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.360
 tells you are operating and son ready 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.009
 There were even St. Petersburg specialists but 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 bring the baby out of the region not 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.960
 it was possible because he was not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.390
 transportable heap of diseases 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.450
 infections mom as it is listed there 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.909
 a bunch of disease that you are generally prohibited 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 because I have a baby on my way 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.860
 just die not even this is a receipt 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.299
 what and what if my 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 baby dying i'm warned or sunda 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:52.110
 No one can and no exactly what I am 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.119
 so that itâ€™s main from the street 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.920
 my child is not transportable 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.659
 nevertheless the road is a few hundred 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.159
 kilometers from the village big from mazda 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.659
 Novosibirsk is already behind 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.520
 the boy paid for transportation 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.560
 charity foundation and mom is ready 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.110
 bend another statement of Omsk doctors 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.009
 about the fact that the child does not usually have a brain 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.739
 the child started talking with us too 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.700
 he's mom popova a clear tick not 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.069
 says offer us salt and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.200
 the commission that our child is studying 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.329
 he let us take a cookie he did not 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.430
 in the ear anywhere there he was supposed to know 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.890
 that he needs to bite off, he does not like 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.069
 scary when they take it and gently put 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.380
 the company is the only thing that we have a lie and gave 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.540
 big she can principle in her mouth like 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.579
 but it is inconvenient to humiliate their position 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.420
 constantly we drive in front of him only 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.739
 supine position 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.660
 volume of surgery 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.060
 Doctors without exaggeration call 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.370
 huge this 2 maybe 3 hardest 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.959
 operations to reduce the skull result 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.609
 the child will be able to sit independently 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.709
 but first of all doctors will 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.410
 to solve the problem with the removal of fluid by 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.799
 establishing a shunt that is a jester and 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.810
 ventricle through a special pump and this 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.410
 fluid will be discharged abdominal 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.810
 cavity 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.440
 here this part of the bones will be removed 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.440
 together with a decrease in fluid volume 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.810
 in parallel decreases the volume of fluid and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.959
 the picture should remain like this 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.410
 This is the first stage of the operation if everything is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.579
 well then it is planned later 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.329
 removal of the occipital part of these 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.989
 bones 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.569
 there will be a cutter and ravana and connected between 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.970
 a so-called biodegradable 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.690
 plates which for several 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.599
 months 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.630
 themselves will be resolved replacing 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.709
 own bone tissue with 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.870
 hydrocephalus specialists are facing 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.340
 relatively often in Novosibirsk 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.310
 a few years ago operated a boy 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.730
 with girth 76 centimeters experience 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.920
 there is on the doctors anyway 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.540
 at the time of the start of the operation nobody knows 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.340
 its exact duration is the most 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.319
 severe stage hydrocephalus in practice 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.120
 Novosibirsk doctors of the country and the world such 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.160
 cases, the unit will only become 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.319
 unique to world science now 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.300
 the first part of the operation it lasted 20 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.069
 hours already behind the child in intensive care 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.230
 when it will be possible to proceed to the second 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.750
 stage doctors still do not know everything depends 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.910
 from the health of the Roma Julia Fedoseeva vision 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.910
 gay basil stupid news from
