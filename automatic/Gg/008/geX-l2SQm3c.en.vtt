00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.440 

it's<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.140> lot<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.590> motion<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.070> there<00:01:31.420> well<00:01:32.420> I

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's a lot of motion in there well I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.530 
it's a lot of motion in there well I
should<00:01:32.689> see<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:33.229> mean<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:33.500> like<00:01:34.540> it's

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
should see this I mean it's like it's

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.690 
should see this I mean it's like it's
incredible<00:01:36.140> all<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.040> motion<00:01:37.369> into<00:01:37.580> this

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
incredible all the motion into this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.030 
incredible all the motion into this
thing<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.210> think<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.140> lowered<00:01:39.439> area<00:01:39.770> that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
thing I think the lowered area that

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.320 
thing I think the lowered area that
we're<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.399> be<00:01:40.520> watching<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:41.060> back
