within basic Cybertronian form if you
will<00:01:03.080> stands<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:05.250> stands

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
Cybertronian plane let's look at him

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.040 
Cybertronian plane let's look at him
here<00:01:38.800> there's<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.860> very<00:01:39.890> nice<00:01:40.280> toy<00:01:40.660> looks<00:01:41.660> well

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
here there's a very nice toy looks well

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.080 
here there's a very nice toy looks well
they<00:01:42.770> look<00:01:42.950> exactly<00:01:43.070> like<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.790> did<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
they look exactly like it did in the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.150 
they look exactly like it did in the
cartoon<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.660> a<00:01:44.690> Cybertronian<00:01:45.320> form<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.680> does

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
cartoon in a Cybertronian form it does

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.200 
cartoon in a Cybertronian form it does
look<00:01:46.310> pretty<00:01:46.340> close<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.330> mean<00:01:49.210> could

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
look pretty close to it I mean could

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.130 
look pretty close to it I mean could
argue<00:01:50.480> at<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.600> point<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:50.930> it's<00:01:51.080> not

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
argue at the point that it's not

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.930 
argue at the point that it's not
identical<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:51.800> at<00:01:52.250> least<00:01:52.430> we<00:01:52.520> got<00:01:52.610> something

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
identical but at least we got something

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.190 
identical but at least we got something
that<00:01:53.150> looks<00:01:53.300> vaguely<00:01:54.170> familiar<00:01:55.840> yeah

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
that looks vaguely familiar yeah

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.320 
that looks vaguely familiar yeah
overall<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.070> figure<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.490> find<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.910> stands

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
overall this figure I find it stands

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.430 
overall this figure I find it stands
well<00:01:59.480> it<00:01:59.720> looks<00:01:59.960> good

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
well it looks good

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.800 
well it looks good

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
you're gonna get a great figure here

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.020 
you're gonna get a great figure here
there's<00:02:10.160> no<00:02:10.369> doubt<00:02:10.550> about<00:02:10.700> it

there's no doubt about it

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.150 
there's no doubt about it
and<00:02:11.510> with<00:02:11.690> Starscream<00:02:12.260> coming<00:02:12.560> out<00:02:12.650> soon<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and with Starscream coming out soon and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.030 
and with Starscream coming out soon and
I<00:02:13.310> would<00:02:13.730> assume<00:02:13.850> Skywalker's<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.810> wings<00:02:15.040> you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040

could<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.310> all<00:02:16.490> three<00:02:16.760> Cybertronian<00:02:17.450> planes

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
could have all three Cybertronian planes

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.890 
could have all three Cybertronian planes
he<00:02:18.920> also<00:02:19.160> comes<00:02:19.370> with<00:02:19.490> this<00:02:19.760> nice<00:02:20.209> base<00:02:20.540> like

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
he also comes with this nice base like

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.120 
he also comes with this nice base like
they<00:02:21.380> all<00:02:21.530> do<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.430> way<00:02:23.830> micro<00:02:24.830> machine

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
they all do all the way micro machine

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.630 
they all do all the way micro machine
ones<00:02:25.400> come<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> base<00:02:26.060> very<00:02:26.780> nice<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:28.190> we're

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
ones come with a base very nice so we're

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.770 
ones come with a base very nice so we're
gonna<00:02:28.730> bring<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.030> guy<00:02:29.120> back<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.510> robot<00:02:29.750> mode

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
gonna bring this guy back to robot mode

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.810 
gonna bring this guy back to robot mode
here<00:02:30.140> just<00:02:30.380> do<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> little<00:02:30.650> comparison<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
here just do a little comparison to the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.410 
here just do a little comparison to the
original<00:02:32.709> Thundercracker<00:02:34.300> here<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.390> a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
original Thundercracker here is a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.670 
original Thundercracker here is a
comparison<00:02:35.989> shot<00:02:36.320> between<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.860> two<00:02:38.350> as<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
comparison shot between the two as you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.440 
comparison shot between the two as you
can<00:02:39.800> see<00:02:39.950> if<00:02:40.040> they're<00:02:40.190> pretty<00:02:40.400> much<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.150> same

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
can see if they're pretty much the same

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.050 
can see if they're pretty much the same
height<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> generation<00:02:43.640> one<00:02:43.790> might<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:43.940> a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
height and the generation one might be a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.479 
height and the generation one might be a
little<00:02:44.150> higher<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.260> they're<00:02:46.130> almost<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
little higher but they're almost the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.900 
little higher but they're almost the
same<00:02:46.519> height<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:48.280> originals<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
same height the originals for the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.120 
same height the originals for the
original<00:02:50.269> thundercracker<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.560> session<00:02:51.920> has

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
original thundercracker the session has

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.050 
original thundercracker the session has
we<00:02:52.310> reissue<00:02:52.580> right<00:02:52.850> here<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.700> blue<00:02:55.880> is
