00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:08.944
 Hey. 

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:13.289
 Today I will show you how to connect the Sagemcom WHD 80 decoder 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.176
 to receive television in satellite technology. 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.579
 Start by connecting the adapter to an electrical outlet, 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.194
 and connect the power cord to the decoder. 

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.839
 You can connect the TV with the SCART connector, 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.704
 commonly referred to as Euroconnect or via HDMI. 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.533
 Remember that only an HDMI connection allows you to receive programs in Full HD quality. 

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:49.164
 Decide which connector you want to use 

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:52.258
 and connect the TV with one of them. 

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.847
 Of course, I choose HDMI. 

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.481
 A cable from a satellite dish 

00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.968
 connect to the socket in the decoder marked with the satellite symbol. 

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:06.219
 The satellite antenna should be oriented towards the satellite 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.956
 Eutelsat HotBird thirteen degrees east. 

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:13.593
 Information on the assembly and setting of the antenna can be found on our website. 

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:16.795
 Then insert the card into the decoder. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.199
 Place the access card with the chip up and the barcode down. 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.379
 To fully use the Orange TV service, the decoder must be connected to the modem. 

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:33.117
 This can be done in two ways: via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. 

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:36.499
 If you want to connect the decoder over Wi-Fi, 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.026
 turn on the decoder without an Ethernet cable connected 

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:43.195
 and wait for the message saying no connection to be displayed. 

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:48.559
 Press the WPS button on the back of the modem. 

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:51.384
 The diode with the antenna starts to flash. 

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:58.590
 Now press the P + and P- buttons on the front panel of the decoder simultaneously. 

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:02.629
 The LED on the left side of the display will start blinking, 

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:06.028
 and when it turns green it will mean 

00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:07.604
 that the connection has been established. 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.926
 If you have selected a cable connection, 

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:16.879
 then insert the Ethernet cable into the jack with the word modem on the rear panel of the decoder, 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.319
 on the other hand to the red port on the FunBox modem. 

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:26.629
 Then turn on the decoder. 

00:02:27.822 --> 00:02:31.290
 The first running of the decoder will take about a minute. 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.818
 When enabled, the decoder will perform a connection test. 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.124
 Then follow the information on the screen. 

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:44.216
 If the decoder will require a software update, 

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:48.452
 a corresponding message will appear on the TV screen. 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.972
 After completing the configuration, you can now use our TV offer. 

00:02:53.802 --> 00:02:58.184
