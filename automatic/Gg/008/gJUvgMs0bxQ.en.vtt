all right this is a look at the e320 I -

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.089 
all right this is a look at the e320 I -
a<00:00:06.750> -<00:00:06.859> I

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
a - I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.499 
a - I
I<00:00:08.400> think<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> -<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> a0<00:00:11.880> other<00:00:12.179> same

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
I think the a - in the a0 other same

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.789 
I think the a - in the a0 other same
thing<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.929> don't<00:00:12.990> know<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> difference

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
thing I don't know what the difference

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.689 
thing I don't know what the difference
is<00:00:15.619> I'll<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.770> give<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.039> idea<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.340> takes<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
is I'll just give you an idea it takes a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.960 
is I'll just give you an idea it takes a
while<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> turn<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.609> just<00:00:20.609> hit<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> power

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
while to turn on I just hit the power

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.259 
while to turn on I just hit the power
button<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> remote<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.939> see<00:00:30.119> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
button on the remote and you can see it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.590 
button on the remote and you can see it
takes<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.539> good<00:00:31.099> 20<00:00:32.099> seconds<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.000> start

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
takes a good 20 seconds or so to start

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.360 
takes a good 20 seconds or so to start
up<00:00:37.399> it<00:00:38.399> also<00:00:39.230> takes<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.440> long<00:00:40.620> time<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
up it also takes a long time for the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.819 
up it also takes a long time for the
apps<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.000> launch<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:43.140> when<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> start<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
apps to launch right when you start it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.270 
apps to launch right when you start it
up

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
up

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.319 
up
so<00:00:44.730> you'll<00:00:45.210> first<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.629> antennae<00:00:47.329> picture

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so you'll first get antennae picture

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
so you'll first get antennae picture
there<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> launch<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
there you go but if you go to launch the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.590 
there you go but if you go to launch the
apps<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.550> away<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:57.030> takes<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.449> while

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
apps right away it takes a little while

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
apps right away it takes a little while
I<00:00:58.370> think<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.579> has<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> connect<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I think it has to connect to the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.560 
I think it has to connect to the
wireless<00:01:00.390> network<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
wireless network first and then of the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.340 
wireless network first and then of the
apps

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.280 

it's<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.590> 32<00:01:08.010> inch<00:01:08.040> 720p<00:01:09.290> 60<00:01:10.290> Hertz<00:01:10.470> television

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
it's a 32 inch 720p 60 Hertz television

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's a 32 inch 720p 60 Hertz television
it's<00:01:13.290> probably<00:01:13.979> considered<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> best<00:01:15.270> one

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's probably considered the best one

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.810 
it's probably considered the best one
that<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> buy<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.530> now

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.580 

once<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> apps<00:01:21.180> load<00:01:24.259> they<00:01:25.259> are<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> little

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
once the apps load they are a little

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
once the apps load they are a little
slow<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.299> navigate<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:29.119> they<00:01:30.119> get

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
slow to navigate as you can see they get

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.649 
slow to navigate as you can see they get
a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.509> bit<00:01:30.600> better<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> TV<00:01:31.320> starts<00:01:31.710> up

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.389 

but<00:01:39.350> there'll<00:01:40.350> always<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.180> laggy

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
but there'll always be a little laggy

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
but there'll always be a little laggy
the<00:01:44.399> video<00:01:44.700> itself<00:01:45.000> coming<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the video itself coming out of them is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.859 
the video itself coming out of them is
fine<00:01:46.170> once<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.189> launch<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.729> TV<00:01:48.149> show<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.450> movie

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
fine once you launch a TV show or movie

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.910 
fine once you launch a TV show or movie
it<00:01:49.700> doesn't<00:01:50.700> stutter<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.119> anything<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.540> that

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
it doesn't stutter or anything of that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.590 
it doesn't stutter or anything of that
it's<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.130> obviously<00:01:53.460> using<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.119> slow

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's just obviously using a really slow

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's just obviously using a really slow
processor<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.040> something<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
processor if you get something like a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.139 
processor if you get something like a
Roku<00:01:56.939> 3<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.549> noticeably<00:01:59.549> faster<00:02:02.149> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Roku 3 it would be noticeably faster it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.559 
Roku 3 it would be noticeably faster it
does<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.570> yahoo<00:02:03.899> apps

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.070 

and<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.739> couple<00:02:12.069> of<00:02:12.129> other<00:02:12.510> interesting<00:02:13.510> things

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and a couple of other interesting things

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.800 
and a couple of other interesting things
it<00:02:14.230> has<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> DLNA<00:02:15.510> component<00:02:16.510> which<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:19.060> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
it has a DLNA component which if you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.130 
it has a DLNA component which if you
launch<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.069> immediately<00:02:21.430> crashes<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
launch it just immediately crashes the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.100 
launch it just immediately crashes the
television<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.010> well<00:02:24.849> it<00:02:25.120> but<00:02:25.659> not<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.900> it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
crashes the television but if I connect

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.229 
crashes the television but if I connect
to<00:02:29.670> anything<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.209> crashes<00:02:33.000> yeah<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.120> can

see<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:36.549> concede<00:02:37.000> DLNA<00:02:37.569> things<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.769> my

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
see it it concede DLNA things on my

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.770 
see it it concede DLNA things on my
network<00:02:39.849> it<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.980> can't<00:02:42.430> serve<00:02:42.640> them<00:02:42.819> up

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.680 

it's<00:02:46.780> only<00:02:47.190> 26<00:02:48.190> watts<00:02:48.400> which<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.000> pretty

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
it's only 26 watts which is pretty

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.129 
it's only 26 watts which is pretty
amazing<00:02:50.409> it's<00:02:52.170> incredibly<00:02:54.480> powerful<00:02:55.480> has<00:02:56.109> a

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
amazing it's incredibly powerful has a

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.170 
amazing it's incredibly powerful has a
very<00:02:56.379> thin<00:02:56.680> bezel<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:58.510> how<00:02:58.870> they<00:02:59.019> do<00:02:59.079> it<00:02:59.349> is<00:03:00.180> by

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
very thin bezel and how they do it is by

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.089 
very thin bezel and how they do it is by
making<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.900> television<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:03.730> thick<00:03:08.099> so

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
making the television really thick so

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.710 
making the television really thick so
you<00:03:09.579> know<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.760> give<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:12.389> thinness<00:03:13.389> of<00:03:13.659> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
you know you give up the thinness of the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.289 
you know you give up the thinness of the
television<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.190> really<00:03:18.669> thin<00:03:18.879> bezel

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
