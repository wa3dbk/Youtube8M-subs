early<00:05:00.300> now<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.680> figure<00:05:02.069> maybe<00:05:02.280> if<00:05:03.150> this

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
early now and I figure maybe if this

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.029 
early now and I figure maybe if this
does<00:05:03.810> well<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.229> might<00:05:04.379> encourage<00:05:04.530> them<00:05:05.009> to

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
does well it might encourage them to

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.589 
does well it might encourage them to
give<00:05:05.250> other<00:05:05.400> smaller<00:05:05.789> channels<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.300> same

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
give other smaller channels the same

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.019 
give other smaller channels the same
kind<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:07.080> opportunity<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.979> same<00:05:08.279> kind<00:05:08.639> of<00:05:08.819> a

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:09.029 
kind of opportunity the same kind of a

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.680 
kind of opportunity the same kind of a
scheduled<00:05:09.870> spot<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:11.370> just<00:05:11.610> because<00:05:11.940> you
