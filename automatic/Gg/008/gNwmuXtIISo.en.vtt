00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
my die so whole basically what you do is

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.130 
my die so whole basically what you do is
you<00:03:10.350> snap<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.160> end<00:03:11.340> off<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.390> then

you snap the end off like this and then

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.410 
you snap the end off like this and then
it<00:03:13.410> elongates<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.400> pent<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.940> elongate<00:03:15.120> and

it elongates the pent you elongate and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940 
it elongates the pent you elongate and
then<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.930> stick<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.380> like<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.709> now

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950

these sunglasses because I like the way
that<00:05:42.220> they<00:05:42.400> sit<00:05:42.640> on<00:05:42.820> my<00:05:42.970> face<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.740> like<00:05:44.740> it's

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
that they sit on my face and like it's

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.420 
that they sit on my face and like it's
okay<00:05:45.970> on<00:05:46.150> my<00:05:46.330> nose<00:05:46.600> I<00:05:46.930> guess<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.500> I<00:05:47.740> like<00:05:48.130> huge

sunglasses<00:05:48.669> I<00:05:49.060> think<00:05:49.389> they're<00:05:49.600> much<00:05:50.020> better

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
sunglasses I think they're much better

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.469 
sunglasses I think they're much better
than<00:05:50.860> small<00:05:51.250> ones<00:05:51.280> because<00:05:51.789> when<00:05:52.000> you<00:05:52.120> look<00:05:52.270> up

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
than small ones because when you look up

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.100 
than small ones because when you look up
and<00:05:52.750> around<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:53.260> stuff<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:54.070> can<00:05:54.310> still<00:05:54.639> have

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
and around and stuff you can still have

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.900 
and around and stuff you can still have
sun<00:05:56.110> protection<00:05:56.530> and<00:05:56.919> I<00:05:57.100> think<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.400> color<00:05:57.639> on

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
sun protection and I think the color on

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.260 
sun protection and I think the color on
this<00:05:58.060> is<00:05:58.300> freaking<00:05:59.229> fantastic<00:05:59.500> it<00:06:00.280> makes<00:06:01.120> your
