your wheel wet so straight off and you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.740 
your wheel wet so straight off and you
can<00:00:57.930> spray<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.500> stuff<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:59.309> around<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.210> on

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
down what that stuff does is pretty much

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.859 
down what that stuff does is pretty much
takes<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> dust<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.299> whatever<00:01:39.299> else<00:01:39.659> is

on<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.170> wheels<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.740> pretty<00:01:41.159> much<00:01:41.250> eat<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.119> up

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
on your wheels and pretty much eat it up

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.219 
on your wheels and pretty much eat it up
to<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> gets<00:01:42.720> loose<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:44.899> start<00:01:45.899> walking

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to where it gets loose and start walking

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.120 
to where it gets loose and start walking
it<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.540> every<00:01:51.960> nook<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it down you want to get every nook and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.749 
it down you want to get every nook and
cranny<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.549> possibly<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:55.229> stuff<00:01:55.759> pretty

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
cranny you possibly can to stuff pretty

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:05.100 
cranny you possibly can to stuff pretty
much<00:01:56.820> eats<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.750> off<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:58.110> wheels

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.040 

even<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:05.980> even<00:02:06.250> when<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:07.240> starts<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.660> rust<00:02:07.840> a

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
even it even when it starts to rust a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.080 
even it even when it starts to rust a
little<00:02:08.170> bit<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.620> actually<00:02:09.070> takes<00:02:09.700> care<00:02:10.030> of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
little bit this actually takes care of

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:24.530 
little bit this actually takes care of
that<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.450> prevents<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.900> from<00:02:10.990> rusting<00:02:11.440> I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.680 

think<00:02:25.540> that's<00:02:25.780> pretty<00:02:26.110> much<00:02:26.440> got<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
think that's pretty much got it all and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:44.930 
think that's pretty much got it all and
I<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:29.170> want<00:02:29.320> spray<00:02:29.620> all<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.040> off

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.240 

I'm<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.270> little<00:02:46.390> bit<00:02:46.630> right<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
I'm just a little bit right here but you

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.590 
I'm just a little bit right here but you
could<00:02:54.400> tell<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.210> night<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.990> day

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
could tell it is a night and day

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.350 
could tell it is a night and day
difference<00:02:59.460> how<00:03:00.460> good<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.820> stuff<00:03:00.940> actually

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
difference how good this stuff actually

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.620 
difference how good this stuff actually
is<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:02.080> if<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.710> got<00:03:02.890> chrome<00:03:03.190> wheels<00:03:03.460> any<00:03:04.360> time

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
is so if you got chrome wheels any time

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.650 
is so if you got chrome wheels any time
