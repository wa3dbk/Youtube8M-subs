00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
be doing is measuring your plate to find

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
be doing is measuring your plate to find
the<00:01:29.009> center<00:01:29.250> piece<00:01:29.490> speak<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.270> front<00:01:30.420> exactly

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the center piece speak in front exactly

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
the center piece speak in front exactly
where<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> want<00:01:31.320> our<00:01:31.470> candlestick<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.280> so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
where we want our candlestick to go so

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.039 
where we want our candlestick to go so
I'm<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:33.479> finding<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
I'm just going to do this by finding the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.960 
I'm just going to do this by finding the
middle<00:01:34.290> point<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.549> first<00:01:35.790> edge

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
middle point on the first edge

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.940 
middle point on the first edge
I<00:01:43.540> just<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.660> just<00:01:44.720> made<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> little<00:01:45.170> dot<00:01:45.710> with<00:01:45.920> a

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
I just I just made a little dot with a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.040 
I just I just made a little dot with a
permanent<00:01:46.220> marker<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.760> this<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.780> enough<00:01:47.960> to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
permanent marker and this is enough to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.080 
permanent marker and this is enough to
be<00:01:48.140> exactly<00:01:48.620> exact<00:01:49.160> we're<00:01:49.730> just<00:01:49.910> trying<00:01:50.060> to

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
be exactly exact we're just trying to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.520 
be exactly exact we're just trying to
find<00:01:50.360> like<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.660> rough<00:01:50.930> point<00:01:51.170> where<00:01:51.440> the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
find like a rough point where the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.930 
find like a rough point where the
candlestick<00:01:51.980> is<00:01:52.040> going<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.280> go<00:01:52.370> I'm<00:01:52.640> gonna<00:01:52.820> do

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940

the candlestick and we're going to place

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.450 
the candlestick and we're going to place
it<00:02:17.300> somewhere<00:02:18.080> around<00:02:18.470> our<00:02:18.770> little<00:02:19.040> mark<00:02:19.220> here

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and apply pressure to it for maybe 10 to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:33.580 
and apply pressure to it for maybe 10 to
20<00:02:21.710> seconds<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.660> now<00:02:32.810> that's<00:02:33.050> glued<00:02:33.380> down
