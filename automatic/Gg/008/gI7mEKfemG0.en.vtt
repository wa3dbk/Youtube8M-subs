00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.609
 hello welcome to my game of the month 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.200
 good should my game this month is 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.760
 a little bit changed in the end the game 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.290
 that we are going to analyze during October is 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.540
 as you have seen the great space 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.860
 hulk I'll start by saying that space hulk is 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.529
 a game that today can not be 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.180
 buy as new is discontinued and 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.250
 some copies in second hand but 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.990
 they have a pretty exorbitant price and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.010
 because you will wonder why to dedicate 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.160
 the month the game that can not be 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.420
 get is not frequent nor will we 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.949
 welcome, of course, but I think 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.019
 space hulk is one of the few that are in 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.339
 this situation that does not deserve this that 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.629
 I have in my hands is the third 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.550
 space school edition I think it's a 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.590
 Solera game that takes with us 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.780
 since in the 80s he has had several 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.879
 editions including an adaptation in 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.870
 Spanish called star crusade already 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.870
 mattel charge 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.750
 this town does not believe that it is workshop 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.760
 famous brand and that has all the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.500
 warhammer catalog and is inspired 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 is based on the universe of warhammer 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.630
 40,000 if you know something under 40 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.170
 thousand will sound a bit of what it is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.509
 space school 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.610
 space hulk literally means price 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.590
 spatial if someone finds it strange to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.759
 the word price to me it was 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.909
 has had to go find the dictionary 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.350
 that is to say that in a price it is a ship 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.140
 normally a ship that has been 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.970
 abandoned to drift because space us 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.470
 place before one of these prices of these 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.820
 abandoned birds that is not a ship but 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.990
 who are space arab 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.240
 in fact the manual tells us that it is not 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.490
 one but there are several several ships that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.880
 navigating through the warp space 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.670
 they are abandoned and come together if 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.470
 let's say the gravity is attracted and it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.050
 put together a little mega ship 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.759
 sometimes chaotic these ships leave for 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.150
 a warp crack the space of 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.660
 report to reach our reality 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.420
 may contain dangers this game to 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.240
 Two players place 1 to 12 players 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.940
 commanding the space marines already 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.910
 another in charge of a steelers 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.160
 aliens who try both sides and 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.870
 fight for survival in the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.970
 a little historical background that you have 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.920
 facebook very finger in the manual tells us 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 that in the year 900 and peak of the millennium 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.670
 40 well there is a battle in the sector 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.580
 coris in an abandoned space wreck 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.820
 the space marines go there to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.570
 secure the area and it turns out to be a true 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.490
 a true failure at the hands of general 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.540
 zhang year the commander and shanghai or 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.870
 it is a disaster and that defeat ballast 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.270
 a little to the space marines almost 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.280
 600 years later a huge price 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.350
 appears very close to the wrong planet 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.640
 original planet of the marines 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.720
 space 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.400
 that giant price is let's say send us 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.400
 in the would be sent investigate a series 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.930
 of marines trying 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.370
 remove a little that stain from your 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.970
 file in the hands of Captain Rafael 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.400
 they will try to eliminate all the invasion jim 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.680
 stiller these brutal aliens that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.329
 they have inside the game remember 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.790
 much to the movie aliens the return 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.560
 it gets us inside that has been one of a 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.200
 movie how is the ies camilo in 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 where there are a few marines a 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.709
 big space to investigate and ones 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.220
 terrible aliens who have an air 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.409
 and that will make things very difficult to 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.329
 fact we have many details that we 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.000
 remember that for example a series of 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.650
 chips that will indicate the radar on whether 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.590
 there are enemies nearby we will see calmly 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.849
 but good to give you an idea 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.290
 a game of space cool however is 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.389
 pretty fast in less than an hour 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.150
 it should be played to be two players 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.069
 and be quite a turn enough of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 often it is not done at all heavy 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.180
 it also plays with some missions that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.639
 describe well in the missions manual 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.260
 and describe the entire campaign of this 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.010
 special price that is called sin of 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.659
 condemnation 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.909
 how the marines got there 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.129
 they tried to eliminate the hordes of jim 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.450
 steelers are 12 missions that can be 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.030
 play sequentially to conform 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.370
 the whole story 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.010
 it is a game very highly recommended to me 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.660
 it seems one of the best games out there 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.580
 nothing to do with warhammer the fact that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.810
 we are something warhammer 40,000 does not want 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.639
 say that we will be warhammer that is 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.930
 collecting miniatures is a game that 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.090
 what games workshop let's say game 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.880
 Specialist game alone and 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.350
 I hope I hope and one day the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.419
 pocket surprise us with a fourth 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.760
 Space cool edition because it's a game 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.639
 that really deserves it if not be 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.250
 watch for this month you will see how as 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.410
 I'm wrong and remember our raffle 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.640
 usual game of the next month to 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.530
 this month of space school 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.090
 we will give clues as to what the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.800
 game of the month of November that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.320
 guess the first one who discovers which one is 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.630
 the month will take a copy of the game 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.000
 for players who come courtesy of 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.850
 click on road so do not miss all the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.510
 month about this game of battles 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.740
 desperate between humans and aliens 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.740
 thanks for your time
