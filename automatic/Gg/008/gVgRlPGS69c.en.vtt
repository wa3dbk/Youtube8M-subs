00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.980 

a<00:00:04.710> lot<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.279> role<00:00:05.580> play<00:00:05.759> games<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.299> rather

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
a lot of role play games are rather

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.459 
a lot of role play games are rather
unfortunately<00:00:07.830> fixated<00:00:08.490> upon<00:00:08.580> combat<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.660> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
unfortunately fixated upon combat and I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.629 
unfortunately fixated upon combat and I
think<00:00:10.710> they<00:00:10.800> give<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> lot<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.219> players<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
think they give a lot of players the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.589 
think they give a lot of players the
idea<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.090> they're<00:00:12.240> supposed<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.509> be

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
idea that they're supposed to be

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.820 
idea that they're supposed to be
fighting<00:00:13.110> their<00:00:13.259> way<00:00:13.290> through<00:00:13.620> every

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
fighting their way through every

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.470 
fighting their way through every
situation<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.490> well<00:00:14.639> presumably<00:00:15.089> combat

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
situation because well presumably combat

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.670 
situation because well presumably combat
happens<00:00:15.750> an<00:00:15.839> awful<00:00:16.049> lot<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> time<00:00:16.440> because

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
happens an awful lot of time because

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
happens an awful lot of time because
just<00:00:16.830> look<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> rulebook<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.789> looks<00:00:18.150> for

whatever it is just loads and loads of
combat<00:00:36.420> related<00:00:36.540> stuff<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.770> wow

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
combat related stuff and you think wow

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.889 
combat related stuff and you think wow
it's<00:00:39.420> interesting<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:41.660> we<00:00:42.660> seem<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.840> be

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's interesting because we seem to be

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.610 
it's interesting because we seem to be
missing<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:44.280> big<00:00:44.789> part<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.809> action

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
missing a really big part of action

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.100 
missing a really big part of action
think<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.250> films<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.539> there<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.780> action

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
think of films now there are action

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
think of films now there are action
sequences<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.620> films<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.149> fights

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
sequences and films are they all fights

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.740 
sequences and films are they all fights
I<00:00:52.489> put<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> actually<00:00:54.300> an<00:00:54.390> awful

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
I put it to you that actually an awful

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.680 
I put it to you that actually an awful
lot<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.039> action<00:00:56.039> sequences<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.670> films<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.360> not

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
lot of action sequences in films are not

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.510 
lot of action sequences in films are not
fights<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.500> something<00:00:58.890> else<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.489> are

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
fights they are something else they are

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
fights they are something else they are
something<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> almost<00:01:00.570> completely

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
something that is almost completely

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.189 
something that is almost completely
ignored<00:01:01.680> by<00:01:02.219> almost<00:01:02.789> every<00:01:03.329> single<00:01:03.600> role<00:01:03.960> play

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ignored by almost every single role play

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.450 
ignored by almost every single role play
system<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.810> chases<00:01:07.159> yeah<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
system out there chases yeah think of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
system out there chases yeah think of
action<00:01:08.820> film<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.450> got<00:01:09.600> fights<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.229> you've

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
action film you got fights and you've

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
action film you got fights and you've
got<00:01:11.040> chases<00:01:11.760> haven't<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.689> where's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
got chases haven't you so where where's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
got chases haven't you so where where's
the<00:01:13.680> chapter<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.250> chasing<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the chapter on chasing where are the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
the chapter on chasing where are the
chapters<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.930> chasing<00:01:16.200> why<00:01:16.650> haven't

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
chapters on chasing why haven't

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
chapters on chasing why haven't
characters<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.820> several<00:01:18.210> chasing<00:01:18.810> related

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
characters got several chasing related

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.100 
characters got several chasing related
skills<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.280> by<00:01:20.580> noticing<00:01:20.850> -<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.240> fact<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.659> lot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
skills but by noticing - in fact a lot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
skills but by noticing - in fact a lot
of<00:01:22.140> roleplay<00:01:22.650> game<00:01:22.860> systems<00:01:23.280> simply<00:01:23.820> give<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
of roleplay game systems simply give a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.999 
of roleplay game systems simply give a
character<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.630> speed<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.350> he<00:01:25.530> moves<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
character a speed at which he moves and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
character a speed at which he moves and
that's<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.110> 30<00:01:28.500> feet<00:01:28.740> around

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that's it so if I go at 30 feet around

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
that's it so if I go at 30 feet around
and<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.400> goes<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.729> 30<00:01:30.030> feet<00:01:30.180> around

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and he goes at 30 feet around

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.560 
and he goes at 30 feet around
I<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:31.439> never<00:01:31.680> catch<00:01:32.070> him<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.729> move<00:01:33.150> 30

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I will never catch him we just move 30

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
I will never catch him we just move 30
feet<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.590> whatever<00:01:34.829> distance<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.220> start<00:01:35.490> apart

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
feet or whatever distance we start apart

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.340 
feet or whatever distance we start apart
we<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:36.390> remain<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.810> distance<00:01:37.110> apart

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
we will remain that distance apart

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.789 
we will remain that distance apart
forever<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.759> run<00:01:39.090> unless<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.530> games

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
forever as we run unless the the games

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.910 
forever as we run unless the the games
master<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.340> comes<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.150> some

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
master just comes up with some

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
master just comes up with some
improvised<00:01:43.920> reasons<00:01:44.909> whether<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> might

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
improvised reasons whether this might

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
improvised reasons whether this might
change<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.979> put<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.610> fact

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
change but I put it to you then in fact

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.020 
change but I put it to you then in fact
this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> major<00:01:49.320> gap<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.250> roleplay<00:01:50.700> rules

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
this is a major gap in roleplay rules

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
this is a major gap in roleplay rules
why<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.200> rules<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.740> chasing<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
why are there not rules for chasing I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
why are there not rules for chasing I
would<00:01:53.700> suggest<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.420> come<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.689> with

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
would suggest that you come up with

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.670 
would suggest that you come up with
three<00:01:55.320> three<00:01:55.890> sets<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.430> rules<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.969> chasing

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
three three sets of rules for chasing

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.069 
three three sets of rules for chasing
I'm<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> call<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.310> sprinting<00:02:00.299> chasing

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
I'm going to call them sprinting chasing

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.179 
I'm going to call them sprinting chasing
and<00:02:01.430> pursuing<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:04.320> another<00:02:04.920> talk

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and pursuing and I think another talk

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.859 
and pursuing and I think another talk
about<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> exactly<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.240> dice<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
about the exactly what dice you have to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.359 
about the exactly what dice you have to
roll<00:02:07.020> whatever<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.560> every<00:02:07.979> roleplay

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
roll whatever because every roleplay

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.669 
roll whatever because every roleplay
game<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:09.000> different<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.989> skill<00:02:10.259> set<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.619> be

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
game is different the skill set will be

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.809 
game is different the skill set will be
different<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> dice<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.220> use<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> will<00:02:11.790> be

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
different the dice you use it will be

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
different the dice you use it will be
different<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.420> come<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.780> whatever

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
different you come up with whatever

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.890 
different you come up with whatever
suits<00:02:13.349> you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
suits you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.320 
suits you
I<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.920> need<00:02:15.340> rules<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.879> these<00:02:16.000> three

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
I think you need rules for these three

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.380 
I think you need rules for these three
things<00:02:16.569> first<00:02:17.170> sprinting<00:02:17.950> sprinting<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:18.970> a

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.099 
work and so forth action-packed chasing
and<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:50.620> need<00:03:50.829> rules<00:03:51.400> within<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.930> that

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
and you need rules within this so that

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.869 
and you need rules within this so that
you<00:03:53.560> know<00:03:53.799> each<00:03:54.069> round<00:03:54.459> whether<00:03:54.699> you're

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
gaining or losing ground and you keep

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.979 
gaining or losing ground and you keep
reasonable<00:03:57.970> track<00:03:58.180> of<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.419> distance<00:03:58.810> between

reasonable track of the distance between
you<00:03:59.410> um<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.579> there<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.180> go<00:04:01.329> I'm<00:04:01.870> not<00:04:01.930> gonna

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
you um so there you go I'm not gonna

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.839 
you um so there you go I'm not gonna
suggest<00:04:02.620> as<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:02.799> say<00:04:02.949> specific<00:04:03.340> rules<00:04:03.549> because

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
suggest as I say specific rules because

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.670 
suggest as I say specific rules because
I<00:04:03.879> think<00:04:03.970> that's<00:04:04.239> entirely<00:04:04.599> system<00:04:05.290> specific

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
I think that's entirely system specific

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.559 
I think that's entirely system specific
and<00:04:05.919> and<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.790> should<00:04:06.970> come<00:04:07.090> up<00:04:07.180> with<00:04:07.209> whatever

role play games a little bit more

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.140 
role play games a little bit more
interesting<00:04:11.889> by<00:04:12.010> coming<00:04:12.310> up<00:04:12.370> with<00:04:12.430> chasing

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
interesting by coming up with chasing

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.629 
interesting by coming up with chasing
rules<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:14.319> great<00:04:14.620> thing<00:04:14.859> about<00:04:15.010> chasing

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
rules and a great thing about chasing

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.150 
rules and a great thing about chasing
rules<00:04:15.849> is<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:17.229> they<00:04:17.650> will<00:04:17.769> make<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:18.039> possible

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
rules is that they will make it possible

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.210 
rules is that they will make it possible
for<00:04:18.930> villains<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.169> get<00:04:20.500> away<00:04:20.769> rather<00:04:21.099> than

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
for villains to get away rather than

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.209 
for villains to get away rather than
always<00:04:21.820> fight<00:04:22.719> and<00:04:22.960> yeah<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.710> always<00:04:23.890> happens

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:24.219 
always fight and yeah it always happens

doesn't<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.550> big<00:04:24.669> villain<00:04:24.940> as<00:04:25.450> soon<00:04:25.690> as

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
doesn't it the big villain as soon as

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.510 
doesn't it the big villain as soon as
you<00:04:25.840> actually<00:04:26.080> get<00:04:26.229> him<00:04:26.349> into<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> fight<00:04:26.830> he

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
you actually get him into a fight he

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.189 
you actually get him into a fight he
it<00:04:27.580> gets<00:04:27.879> away<00:04:28.000> because<00:04:28.720> he<00:04:28.900> seems<00:04:29.080> so

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
it gets away because he seems so

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.930 
it gets away because he seems so
contrived<00:04:29.650> oh<00:04:29.919> he<00:04:30.129> was<00:04:30.220> all<00:04:30.340> together<00:04:30.580> way<00:04:30.789> the

contrived oh he was all together way the
GM<00:04:31.180> said<00:04:31.389> just<00:04:31.780> didn't<00:04:32.020> want<00:04:32.139> him<00:04:32.229> killed<00:04:32.289> so

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740
