you<00:02:13.950> as<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.360> had<00:02:15.570> sleeve<00:02:15.840> my

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you as you can see if I had sleeve my

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870 
you as you can see if I had sleeve my
cards<00:02:16.410> there'd<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.010> plenty<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.370> room<00:02:17.550> for<00:02:17.610> them

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
cards there'd be plenty of room for them

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.250 
cards there'd be plenty of room for them
because<00:02:17.970> there's<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.330> kinds<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.720> space<00:02:18.990> here

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
because there's all kinds of space here

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.950 
because there's all kinds of space here
for<00:02:19.770> sleeved<00:02:20.040> or<00:02:20.280> unsleep<00:02:20.820> cards<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.840> have

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
for sleeved or unsleep cards and I have

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.900 
for sleeved or unsleep cards and I have
the<00:02:22.080> first<00:02:22.230> expansion<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> game<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the first expansion for the game that is

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.240 
the first expansion for the game that is
also<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.810> along<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> base<00:02:25.620> set<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
also in here along with the base set and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710 
also in here along with the base set and
as<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.910> there's<00:02:27.090> still<00:02:27.150> plenty<00:02:27.540> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
as you can see there's still plenty of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
as you can see there's still plenty of
room<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.260> grow<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.160> thought<00:02:29.490> this<00:02:29.640> eldritch

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
room to grow so I thought this eldritch

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.780 
room to grow so I thought this eldritch
or<00:02:30.180> insert<00:02:30.630> was<00:02:31.230> excellent<00:02:31.710> now<00:02:32.130> Eldridge<00:02:32.580> had

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
or insert was excellent now Eldridge had

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.610 
or insert was excellent now Eldridge had
a<00:02:32.820> lot<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.000> different<00:02:33.360> components<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.440> what

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
a lot of different components but what

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.980 
a lot of different components but what
about<00:02:34.860> our<00:02:34.890> friend<00:02:35.340> mage<00:02:36.060> Knight<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.690> have

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
about our friend mage Knight I have

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.870 
about our friend mage Knight I have
every<00:02:37.410> expansion<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.310> game<00:02:38.580> some<00:02:38.820> of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
every expansion for this game some of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.060 
every expansion for this game some of
them<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.120> haven't<00:02:39.390> even<00:02:39.630> fully<00:02:40.260> unwrapped<00:02:40.860> yet

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
them I haven't even fully unwrapped yet

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.370 
them I haven't even fully unwrapped yet
there's<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:41.700> much<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> base<00:02:42.330> game

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
there's just so much in the base game

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.020 
there's just so much in the base game
but<00:02:43.380> there's<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.830> many<00:02:43.950> different<00:02:44.070> kinds<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
but there's so many different kinds of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.730 
but there's so many different kinds of
components<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.230> need<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.590> keep

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
components that you need to keep

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.650 
components that you need to keep
separate<00:02:47.190> when<00:02:47.340> you're<00:02:47.490> playing<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.420> had<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
separate when you're playing so I had a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
separate when you're playing so I had a
just<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.960> variety<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.650> different<00:02:49.980> baggies<00:02:50.550> in

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
just a variety of different baggies in

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000 
just a variety of different baggies in
here<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.030> setting<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> game<00:02:51.780> was<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.440> total

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
here so setting up the game was a total

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.980 
here so setting up the game was a total
nuisance<00:02:53.460> not<00:02:54.300> anymore

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
nuisance not anymore

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.710 
nuisance not anymore
look<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.470> these<00:02:55.620> trays<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:57.240> want<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.660> could

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
look at these trays if I want I could

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.630 
look at these trays if I want I could
probably<00:02:58.050> just<00:02:58.290> play<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> game<00:02:58.620> straight<00:02:59.490> out

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
probably just play the game straight out

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.520 
probably just play the game straight out
of<00:02:59.700> these<00:02:59.850> trays<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.570> table<00:03:01.020> so

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
of these trays on the table so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.990 
of these trays on the table so
everything<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.160> sorted<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.640> organized

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
everything can be sorted and organized

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.580 
everything can be sorted and organized
neatly<00:03:03.360> as<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.200> there's<00:03:04.380> still<00:03:04.440> some

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
neatly as you can see there's still some

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.800 
neatly as you can see there's still some
room<00:03:04.890> even<00:03:05.040> here<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.490> grow<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:06.210> tray<00:03:06.510> comes

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
room even here to grow this tray comes

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.230 
room even here to grow this tray comes
out<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.140> underneath<00:03:07.440> we<00:03:07.800> have<00:03:08.340> all<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.820> tiles

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
out and underneath we have all the tiles

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.350 
out and underneath we have all the tiles
including<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> expansions<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:11.730> again<00:03:12.060> just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
including the expansions so again just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.210 
including the expansions so again just
something<00:03:12.570> else<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> was<00:03:13.320> very<00:03:13.680> impressed

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
something else that I was very impressed

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.980 
something else that I was very impressed
with<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.700> as<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.210> can<00:03:15.330> see<00:03:15.390> there's<00:03:15.780> enough

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
with and as you can see there's enough

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.810 
with and as you can see there's enough

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
clearance on the top here you can get

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.790 
clearance on the top here you can get
