engine compartment cut that come a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
engine compartment cut that come a
little<00:00:50.430> close<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:51.530> want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> show<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:54.440> are

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
little close I want to show you this are

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.279 
little close I want to show you this are
generally<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.670> centered<00:00:57.300> than<00:00:57.719> most<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.170> our

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
generally more centered than most of our

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.860 
generally more centered than most of our
competition<00:00:59.100> most<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.820> our<00:00:59.879> competition<00:01:00.629> puts

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
competition most of our competition puts

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
competition most of our competition puts
the<00:01:01.020> batteries<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.770> side<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.539> causes

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the batteries on the side that causes

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
the batteries on the side that causes
secondary<00:01:03.830> accidents<00:01:04.830> which<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.610> cause

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
secondary accidents which would cause

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.410 
secondary accidents which would cause
more<00:01:06.750> damage<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> later<00:01:07.770> our<00:01:08.640> battery<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
more damage to you later our battery is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810 
more damage to you later our battery is
centered<00:01:09.990> okay<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.130> therefore<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.670> get

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
centered okay so therefore if you get

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.539 
centered okay so therefore if you get
sideswiped<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.930> won't<00:01:13.229> lose<00:01:13.470> power<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.130> little

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
sideswiped you won't lose power a little

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.149 
sideswiped you won't lose power a little
cause<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> secondary<00:01:15.420> accident<00:01:16.140> also<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
cause a secondary accident also the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
cause a secondary accident also the
anti-lock<00:01:17.580> brakes<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.210> behind<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> battery

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
anti-lock brakes are behind the battery

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.890 
anti-lock brakes are behind the battery
so<00:01:19.830> they're<00:01:20.040> protected<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> outside

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so they're protected not on the outside

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.350 
so they're protected not on the outside
where<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.619> cause<00:01:22.920> loss<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.909> brakes<00:01:24.150> which

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
where you can cause loss of brakes which

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.050 
where you can cause loss of brakes which
cause<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> secondary<00:01:25.259> accident<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.610> also<00:01:26.790> has<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
cause a secondary accident it also has a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.410 
cause a secondary accident it also has a
fire<00:01:27.420> retardant<00:01:28.170> cover<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> top<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
fire retardant cover here on the top and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
fire retardant cover here on the top and
a<00:01:30.509> fire<00:01:30.750> retardant<00:01:30.930> cover<00:01:31.439> protecting<00:01:32.009> from

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
a fire retardant cover protecting from

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700 
a fire retardant cover protecting from
the<00:01:32.310> cabin<00:01:32.700> does<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> fires<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.140> but

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the cabin does it put the fires out but

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
the cabin does it put the fires out but
if<00:01:34.829> God<00:01:35.040> forbid<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.299> will

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
okay now the 2.54 cylinder has got the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
okay now the 2.54 cylinder has got the
sick<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.939> 16-valve<00:01:42.600> engine<00:01:43.079> with

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
variable valve timing okay all the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.679 
variable valve timing okay all the
containers<00:01:46.409> under<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.280> translucent<00:01:47.880> so
