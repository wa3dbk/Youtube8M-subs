what<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.290> about<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.710> is<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.830> when<00:02:12.310> you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
what I like about it is that when you

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.940 
what I like about it is that when you
get<00:02:12.520> at<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> saddle<00:02:13.090> if<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.750> was<00:02:13.870> really<00:02:14.170> stiff

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
get at the saddle if it was really stiff

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.500 
get at the saddle if it was really stiff
and<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:17.560> doesn't<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.040> really<00:02:18.280> solid<00:02:18.510> first

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
