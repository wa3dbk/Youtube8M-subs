00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.320
 and well hello to all the crafter and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.640
 kraft them I know it's true we get 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.020
 find today for a new 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.730
 tutorial and yes right now look for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.980
 the little tutorial a bit rotten 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.300
 because low there are novelties with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.960
 snapshots and when I find some 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.180
 funny stuff 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 it's not too much revolutions and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 super nice stuff with the snap shot 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 I wanted to show today we're going 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 see how to make this campfire 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.370
 so who light up to infinity mean it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 makes a nice effect with small 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.020
 logs and everything and that makes pretty good 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 to brighten up your world simply north 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.149
 know that this normally is the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 coding that wants that and suddenly so it does not 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.270
 not burn it does not light up like you 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.539
 could see it's for example I 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 bought a style this night 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.430
 here you will see that it does not illuminate 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.059
 it is for example I put a torch 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.579
 you will immediately see the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.629
 difference 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.590
 that's not enlightening it's really 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.920
 purely decorative times where I go there 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 arrive 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.830
 day so it's purely decorative but 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 it's pretty cool and it should work 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 normally in future versions 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.310
 in the 1.8 we will say fixed because it is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 in the coding that was done like that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 and that suddenly these bonuses to say it is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.950
 not a glitch do not know it's not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.090
 really a bug so normand something 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.259
 which is expected like that in the coding 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.640
 to allow to make a campfire 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.229
 so we will immediately attacked 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.729
 continue tauriel you will need a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.439
 minimum track was a trick to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.579
 activate me I took a block but you 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.079
 can take a lever with another 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.470
 block 4 armor stand minimum two windows 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.310
 sludges little blogs a matter 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.750
 barrier an iron block of lava and a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.829
 boat so first you will do 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.259
 ask a block you need to do 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.710
 a two by two hole high by 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.450
 five 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 so there one two three four five of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 wide of back you put a block that if 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.090
 you put a boat here then there after 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.129
 the difficulty for example if you are 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 in survival it's going to be like this 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.780
 put the boat down and you try to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.580
 push 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.520
 to the block that is the most straight 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.100
 possible so see it is it thoroughly 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.640
 nickel and wildlife there you have more 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.440
 kaka is here that here and there to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 possibly banal there you have not 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.150
 need something else you put a block 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.250
 from the avs 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.360
 it should flow automatically into 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.950
 the hole and not elsewhere because 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.069
 minecraft is done like that and there you 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.250
 have your Basque then above here 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.450
 you will have to put a block the block of 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.300
 to do it is not compulsory especially 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.150
 a flammable non-flammable block 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.760
 flammable nonflammable brief a thing 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.230
 which fire pump you put a barrier 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.670
 like that in the diagonal vacuum so 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.810
 there you have a pattern there I do 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.970
 a little break for you to understand the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980
 pater that's pretty healthy then you 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.340
 take a first armand amar armor 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.130
 stands that you place like these and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.890
 you will put another block at 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.680
 above this dead art stands and you 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.970
 go up and stands in armor 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.989
 an opposition saw her as the position 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.480
 she is like that so here I go the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 put at 90 we'll put a block here 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.260
 you will understand why you 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.829
 break it should pile up like this 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.810
 that's where you rest you put a 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.540
 gun orsan for example diagonally you 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.239
 break and you hand a gun to 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.810
 stands on the diagonal back and to break 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:35.370
 for now it's done next 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.040
 you do like this you put 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.560
 like a block that there you see at the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.829
 dollar height morstan and you 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.239
 activate her like this you break you 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.650
 should have that then the better it is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.519
 to use a sticky piston so that 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.900
 the blog when he would be very who 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.640
 come back that avoids making you move 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.959
 the weapons at the pits but after all 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.030
 you're going to see it still makes good 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:59.400
 then you break this break 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.410
 these is normally you saw that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.410
 takes fire normally must if it works 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.329
 well it catches fire so it's all 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.600
 simple to do 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.030
 there you will fill 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.280
 earth like these or that we can 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.630
 break and there you will not be able to see 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
 we can not place what is rare 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.920
 morstan small block the trick now 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.100
 it's quite simple you make a pylon 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.040
 from 3-2 to you put two pistons 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.050
 pointing down like this you 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.540
 first put two blocks of earth or the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.830
 block ue wanted to put you fuel 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.550
 you then put two blocks of glass 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.960
 you're feeding you break you're classifying 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.880
 your pistons and you have your party 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.980
 when by the way if I enlarge where 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.750
 ali that's where you have a great fire 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.750
 camp so it's pretty simple to do 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.400
 you can then customize it 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.700
 your thing and do your little corner 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.950
 another little survival corner with for example 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.810
 here is the wool to make you 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.310
 little one kind of fly I did 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.040
 species of at sleeping bags a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.710
 little is rather shit it's rather 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.880
 funny europe which therefore by conveying 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.470
 it extinguished the fire 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.040
 so that's really careful 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.750
 short you understood the principle is 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.720
 there if Norman I give a block of the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.460
 fsa should to that move the man 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.960
 problem is that it displaces our 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.850
 armor stands so she takes on more fire 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.090
 it will really redo as it was 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.530
 in short you have understood principle this has 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.890
 worked it was to show you the 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.200
 result is here just behind and there 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:40.130
 it's exactly the same if I break the 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:42.810
 line here that's it here hop you see it 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.180
 it's exactly the same pattern and in 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.040
 does it rest on the boat what makes 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.480
 the half height it really makes you a 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.920
 little bonfire effect so here we go 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.990
 it's a very simple tutorial I hope 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.460
 that you liked 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.990
 the link so I found that that's 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.520
 not on a youtube channel it's on a 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.140
 web page on minecraft point fr 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.790
 will last the link in the description in 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.870
 plus there are all the screen shots with 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.760
 all the steps so those who 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.030
 would not have understood my rather that 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.290
 will allow you to have to have all 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.340
 the screenshots of all the steps to 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.320
 to achieve your time 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.270
 it's pretty simple it's not very very 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.660
 expensive so I found it helpful to you 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.850
 show it 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.900
 especially because there are a lot of 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.400
 little youtube hours I went to see 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.419
 a bit on the internet and a lot of totti 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.480
 youtuber we make videos to 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.760
 some views and 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.290
 so I saw that it's not too much 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.060
 shared that I as long as the big 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.860
 youtuber will not necessarily bother to 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.240
 show a little system like that I'm 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.650
 am told that I had wanted to show so 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.120
 here on this I leave you chao to all 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.170
 you hear my phone ringing that 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.640
 fall hair pile well for the end the 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.050
 video ciao all take care of yourself 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.850
 think about asking you to comment and to 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.290
 subscribe is what you liked and at the 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.710
 next week or the next all 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.710
 short ciao
