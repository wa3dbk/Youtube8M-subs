out on the road it actually you know

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
out on the road it actually you know
after<00:01:08.490> years<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.210> playing<00:01:09.510> together<00:01:09.689> we

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
after years of not playing together we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.450 
after years of not playing together we

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
kind of missed being on stage together
and<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.970> think<00:01:12.299> our<00:01:12.600> performances<00:01:13.290> have

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and I think our performances have

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
and I think our performances have
actually<00:01:13.830> improved<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.150> by<00:01:15.360> not

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
actually improved you know by not

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.870 
actually improved you know by not
playing<00:01:15.869> together<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.320> six<00:01:16.530> years<00:01:16.880> maybe

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
playing together in six years maybe

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
playing together in six years maybe
everyone<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.509> got<00:01:18.630> excited<00:01:19.140> again<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
everyone just got excited again and and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
everyone just got excited again and and
wanted<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.110> rock

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
out and and so I think everyone's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640
