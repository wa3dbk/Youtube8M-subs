00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.519
 page that I will leave in the description 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.650

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.139
 this version is full of advances and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.480
 bug fixes now we turn to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.850
 download it as you can see there is the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 full version that would download all the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.460
 game uve 49 or the patch that serves to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.010
 update an old version of the counter 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.140
 if you already have it as I already have another 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 version of the game I downloaded the patch 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.260
 we click on it and wait for the time 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.570
 asks us to start the download 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.050
 it only weighs 90 megabytes and will take 1 or 2 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.050
 minutes 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.950
 Once downloaded we open the patch 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.440

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.540
