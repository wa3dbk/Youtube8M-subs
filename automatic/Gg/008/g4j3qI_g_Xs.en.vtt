in the middle of the field going all the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.100 
in the middle of the field going all the
way<00:05:03.860> across<00:05:04.120> he's<00:05:05.120> open<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:05.689> ball<00:05:05.900> is<00:05:06.080> just

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
way across he's open the ball is just

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.890 
way across he's open the ball is just
simply<00:05:06.680> behind<00:05:07.039> him<00:05:07.249> yet<00:05:07.599> Johnson<00:05:08.599> over<00:05:08.749> the

simply behind him yet Johnson over the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.480 
simply behind him yet Johnson over the
top<00:05:09.229> number<00:05:09.469> three<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:09.889> gets<00:05:10.279> the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
top number three that gets the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.339 
top number three that gets the
deflection<00:05:10.819> but<00:05:11.330> if<00:05:11.449> that<00:05:11.629> ball<00:05:11.870> was<00:05:12.139> thrown

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
deflection but if that ball was thrown

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.930 
deflection but if that ball was thrown
accurately<00:05:13.340> that's<00:05:13.939> a<00:05:14.120> great<00:05:14.270> conversion

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.030 

and<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.930> turnover<00:05:19.440> gives<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.830> right<00:05:19.860> back

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
and so the turnover gives it right back

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.720 
and so the turnover gives it right back
to<00:05:20.730> TCU<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.800> gaining<00:05:22.800> speed<00:05:22.950> in<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.370> second

half second and nine pressure and then

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.680 
half second and nine pressure and then
Lindley<00:05:27.960> just<00:05:28.170> dumps<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.620> away<00:05:28.860> as<00:05:29.730> he<00:05:29.880> had<00:05:30.030> not
