00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi to all today i answer the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.980
 question that have faial skins is it 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.450
 possible to fold a sheet over 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.919
 this time we all have a people that we 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.630
 has already told this story he 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.769
 would seem that it would be impossible then 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.880
 we'll check that right now and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 especially trying to understand why 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.240
 it's gone then we'll start already 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.279
 easy with a large single sheet 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 completely normal tiles hewitt a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.250
 nothing extraordinary it's like that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.080
 shit all my schooling 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.239
 today I'm avenging myself go in is a 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:39.270
 I have two so far, that's fine 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:42.690
 four five years already be complicated 6 I 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.670
 do not know if the seventh seventh will come in 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.950
 it's become tiny we try when 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
 even yes 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.039
 I think it's completely 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 disgusting but to bend them this time 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.430
 and there I can clearly not bend it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.110
 once you're ok so it's really 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.699
 impossible in fact so here fire 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 steen I have the answer to your question 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.020
 but I 'm going to try 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 other types of paper of course and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
 other shapes because it comes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 maybe the thickness or the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 flexibility of the paper so to be sure 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.750
 I took of the people and when his sword and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.549
 rigid and very thin tracing paper there 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.640
 flexible like that we will really be able 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.770
 check all this hmm hmm hmm 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 but but but but but but but 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.220
 I will first explain to you why 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.020
 it is said that it is impossible to bend a 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.030
 sheet more than seven times and in fact 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.530
 it's stupid but at every fold you 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.820
 lose in length while you win in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.409
 thickness and after a while you have 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.630
 just longer enough hours for 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.210
 cover the folds already done go on 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.130
 try with the paper Canson one so that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.550
 usually she goes first 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.200
 agrees 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:45.880
 2 3 4 5 6 and I think I 'll get there 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.770
 not even to enter the seventh for 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.119
 this one so the paper cotton poplar 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.460
 that six times we will try now 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.110
 with calq and I read on various sites 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.710
 internet that if we had a paper 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.330
 immense of 10 power 18 km is 6 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.020
 billion twice the distance between the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.500
 earth and sun 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.200
 we could fold it 42 x and reach 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.180
 the moon with its thickness the moon 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.730
 please it's huge 3 4 5 6 7 e 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.650
 game is I have the 7th but still a 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 times it's disgusting is impossible to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.739
 place an eighth then on it then 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.600
 apparently the thickness and stiffness 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.799
 are to be taken into account but for 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.840
 to be sure we will still try with 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.690
 something much thicker from the pack 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.250
 the bubbles and suddenly I cut them and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.230
 in the A4 format because I want the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.730
 variable what is the thickness is not the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.680
 shape it's gone 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 that's it 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.930
 so it looks more like a roll of 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.489
 spring bubble paper case but I have 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.900
 managed to make six but impossible 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.820
 to put a seventh ok so we see 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.260
 although the thickness and rigidity plays 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.090
 an important role but in my opinion there are 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 another variable the format good I you 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.880
 admit I suspected it a little bit I'm 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.950
 am informed before turning this 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.540
 wing qc and the format it matters 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.610
 in 2002 an American student has 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.459
 scored a world record by folding 12 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.620
 times the whole of a roll of pq 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.540
 the record was beaten in 2012 by 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.140
 students and mighty who bent them 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.519
 13 times in rolls of paper of one km2 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.660
 so the format could play as I 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.579
 do not have paper rolls too 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.500
 have it besides I do not really know what 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.850
 I would do it we will rather try to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.770
 rain 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.170
 twelve times a roll of pq on the other hand 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.610
 I'm going to have to do this outside so 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.050
 here in a park I think I have 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.740
 enough room for this test 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.740
 Let's go 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.319
 5 6 7 and 8 yes it's possible so that's it 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.909
 I did not manage to go up to 12 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.799
 like the American student after I 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.870
 surely not been rigorous enough need 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.280
 to say that here there is wind the surface 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.599
 is not smooth and in my opinion the folds that 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.220
 I did not do well on each 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.560
 the others but we do not care I managed 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.209
 to bend it eight times I break the myth 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.829
 so me faience kim I have the answer 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.269
 to your question it is possible to bend 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.840
 a sheet more this time but not a 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.640
 A4 sheet 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.260
 because you have to have a longer length 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.970
 important that wide then all that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.650
 is only mathematical and there is even 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.940
 a formula to deduce the length 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.799
 of a leaf so that it can 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.910
 to be folded n times good I put it to you 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.440
 one but I will not dwell on it 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.730
 because in any case I myself 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.049
 do not understand anything if this question 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.810
 we liked you do not hesitate the video 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.049
 to share it and especially or to beaune 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.049
 evening 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:37.980
 in any case we can say that I 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.980
 I'm bent over backwards for this video
