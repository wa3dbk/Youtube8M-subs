00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.139
 By the way, I closed the video, sir, and he

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.180
 unfortunately the customer's profile 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.109
 interested in buying 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.809
 playing outside 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.350
 to talk a little about black music here 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.350
 for nothing 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 the 4 of November 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.879
 the trick with him is then every 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 four o'clock in Brazil that was old 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:01:01.379
 now it's 95 in the morning they throw 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.890
 What do you think the note is like? 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:21.330
 in law since to do to put it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:43.680
 a discreet clothing but the avaÃ­ in 2002 - 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:02:02.270
 in fact three of difference is not 10 11 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:02:04.560
 12 two in the morning here for me 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.689
 in two hours 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 This does not bother me if we 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.849
 Can you get him to call there? I can get him. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 Do not tell me I want escape in the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.510
 It's true, I have two bikes. 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 has a rule only cbr1000 does not want to talk 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 there's no need to think I had the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.650
 body of your yard 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.360
 not think not only so you have a way 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.790
 to occur something without knowing that 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.599
 I'm talking to him, that 's element. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.799
 speaking on earth there will end up going 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.989
 be his reaction 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.120
 so she until the next video is a month 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.579
 if not two hours will try to do 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 the connection to the mirror they use online there 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.000
 in the store and then it's all right for us 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.980
 will vote yes the three stones three 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200
 attempts in the air a training in this zone 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.880
 that this video is actually because 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.360
 I closed another to want to start over 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:09.530
 To exchange ideas with you, you have to 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:13.670
 send a hug he reads 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.180
 And heck, he hung up, right? 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.980
