00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.680 

some<00:00:05.580> time<00:00:05.759> ago<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.000> mentioned<00:00:06.420> that<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
some time ago I mentioned that the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.720 
some time ago I mentioned that the
theory<00:00:07.080> test<00:00:07.410> will<00:00:07.680> be<00:00:07.799> increased<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.340> 50

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
theory test will be increased to 50

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.629 
theory test will be increased to 50
questions<00:00:09.179> from<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> den<00:00:10.170> 35<00:00:10.740> well<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.429> too

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
questions from the den 35 well it's too

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.640 
questions from the den 35 well it's too
late<00:00:11.670> now<00:00:11.960> yesterday<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.139> beginning<00:00:13.559> of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
late now yesterday was the beginning of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.060 
late now yesterday was the beginning of
the<00:00:13.799> new<00:00:14.009> theory<00:00:14.519> test<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.680> harder

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the new theory test so you have a harder

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
the new theory test so you have a harder
theory<00:00:17.400> test<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.420> increased<00:00:18.900> price<00:00:19.199> as

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
theory test and an increased price as

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
theory test and an increased price as
well<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.890> those<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.609> thinking

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
well so those of you that are thinking

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359 
well so those of you that are thinking
about<00:00:21.480> saving<00:00:22.470> money<00:00:22.650> well<00:00:22.740> you've<00:00:23.100> missed

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
about saving money well you've missed

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.029 
about saving money well you've missed
out<00:00:23.490> there<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.090> theory<00:00:25.019> test<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.619> more

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
out there the theory test now is more

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.080 
out there the theory test now is more
expensive<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.720> um<00:00:28.130> like<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.279> say<00:00:29.490> time<00:00:29.910> waits

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
expensive but um like I say time waits

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.959 
expensive but um like I say time waits
for<00:00:30.269> no<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.340> put<00:00:32.520> things<00:00:32.730> off

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
for no one the more you put things off

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.479 
for no one the more you put things off
is<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> wait<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.190> those<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
is not going to wait for you so those of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
is not going to wait for you so those of
you<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:35.880> thinking<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.450> starting

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
you that are thinking about starting

the time you get round to it are the
practical<00:00:44.399> tests<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.539> include<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
practical tests would then include the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
practical tests would then include the
Eco<00:00:47.129> Drive<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.910> are<00:00:47.969> thinking

one<00:01:32.870> of<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> things<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.440> irritates<00:01:33.950> me<00:01:34.100> most

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
one of the things that irritates me most

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.120 
one of the things that irritates me most
is<00:01:34.660> poopy<00:01:35.660> else<00:01:35.780> who<00:01:36.020> do<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:36.260> appreciate<00:01:36.590> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
is poopy else who do not appreciate the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.880 
is poopy else who do not appreciate the
type<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.400> their<00:01:37.790> driving<00:01:38.030> instructors<00:01:38.890> some

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
type of their driving instructors some

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.830 
type of their driving instructors some
of<00:01:40.010> them<00:01:40.160> just<00:01:40.430> call<00:01:40.760> up<00:01:40.880> at<00:01:41.060> any<00:01:41.330> time<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
of them just call up at any time and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.150 
of them just call up at any time and
think<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.200> they<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.410> cancel<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.010> lesson

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
think that they can cancel the lesson

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.350 
think that they can cancel the lesson
because<00:01:44.590> they<00:01:45.590> haven't<00:01:45.740> paid<00:01:45.980> for<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.360> where

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
because they haven't paid for it where

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.150 
because they haven't paid for it where
the<00:01:47.450> truth<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.870> matter<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.320> driving

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
the truth of the matter is driving

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.470 
the truth of the matter is driving
instructors<00:01:49.610> can<00:01:49.730> be<00:01:49.880> very<00:01:50.060> busy<00:01:50.240> at<00:01:50.450> times

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
instructors can be very busy at times

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.230 
instructors can be very busy at times
and<00:01:51.020> therefore<00:01:51.800> any<00:01:52.070> slot<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:53.060> they've

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
and therefore any slot that they've

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.780 
and therefore any slot that they've
already<00:01:53.450> allocated<00:01:53.810> needs<00:01:54.800> to<00:01:54.980> be<00:01:55.130> paid<00:01:55.520> for

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
already allocated needs to be paid for

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.300
