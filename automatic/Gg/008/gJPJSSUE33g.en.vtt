 In this is my natural way for good and I thought the Fu that I wish sorry Nechotto 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 I think and want to convey the fun of the live 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 I have uploaded videos, but not necessarily in the class, but there are also negative effects. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.680
 I think it's not 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.610
 I was not up to the video, but it was uploaded to the video 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.380
 It's not it, but live 3 has a bit of it for last year's Christmas 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:55.780
 There was a live at Mr. Kelly's and this was a lot of fun 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.750
 Since then, this year 's Chelsea Market in Osaka in January 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.740
 There was a free live and it also went 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.150
 I wanted to up the video also for the two live but Well, as I said 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.960
 I wonder what it is 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:32.240
 I'm sorry I was bought by say I think I arbitrarily so 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.150
 Though I was asked to have bought it is in the er life 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.060
 It comes in plastic bags of Billboard Live 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.450
 This is the other day from the day there will be a live at Billboard Live Tokyo on March 23 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.909
 You started selling it 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.050
 I was not able to go because it was limited and numbered 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.800
 I was bought by a friend who went to the live 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.100
 This is the like this 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.270
 It is a tote bag and it is a record bag 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:11.960
 This is 2000 yen and the record is 3500 yen 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.960
 There is a feeling and 5000 yen in the set, so the contents are 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.750
 Lovely I play a vinyl because I'm a little naughty 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.250
 It is such a feeling 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.870
 I did not go to the place, but I asked my friend Ne and with Liar Anthony 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.870

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.660
 Well, above all I like this song is my favorite song but love 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.890
 It is unbelievable that the album in which the love is recorded is put into a record 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.800
 I'm happy 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:58.870
 It is this record, but it is made in the country with a limited 200 sheets of press 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:04.540
 In fact , we manufacture records in Japan 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:10.599
 It is a company called Toyo Kasei Press as just one company . 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:13.780
 It seems like I'm also doing a factory tour sometimes. 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:17.519
 I'd like to go, but let's just ask 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.519

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:44.060

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.220

 There is a guitarist called Pokemon and Kobochin and I usually work with the three of them. 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.630
 Though 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:34.020
 It's teamed up with the two people I unit, which say the Kubochin and Towada production 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:37.210
 It actually has a live performance as an instrumental band . 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.539

00:04:53.189 --> 00:05:05.610
 It may have been done in Tokyo, but it's very important to be held in Osaka for the first time 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:08.440
 I'm looking forward to it and it's a bit ahead, but let's have soup on July 19 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:14.020

 There is one man live 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.860
 This capa is a big box with about 900 seats and I hope I can do my best to get to Tokyo 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.460

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:34.750
