push<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:58.920> another<00:01:59.100> water<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.729> what

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
push for another water is that what

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.310 
push for another water is that what
you're<00:02:00.210> thinking<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> thinking

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320

okay<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.159> may<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.729> happen<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.119> I've

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
okay that may not happen because I've

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.280 
okay that may not happen because I've
already<00:02:03.360> had<00:02:03.540> two<00:02:03.719> attempts<00:02:04.110> though<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
already had two attempts though I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.039

probably<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> different<00:02:05.280> route<00:02:05.689> well<00:02:06.689> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
probably go a different route well I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
probably go a different route well I
mean<00:02:07.350> yes<00:02:07.710> I'm<00:02:07.920> thinking<00:02:08.160> i'ma<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
mean yes I'm thinking i'ma go a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.949 
mean yes I'm thinking i'ma go a
different<00:02:08.729> route<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.390> leads<00:02:09.629> back<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
different route but it all leads back to

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.260

world and that's what I want to be and
yes<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.920> might<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.190> unrealistic<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.970> think

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
yes it might be unrealistic to think

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.690 
yes it might be unrealistic to think
that<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:20.960> until<00:02:21.320> somebody<00:02:21.740> beats<00:02:22.070> me<00:02:22.460> and
