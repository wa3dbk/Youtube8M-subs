00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.360
 looking at a boat one often asks oneself 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.219
 who knows how much it costs 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.560
 many believe that the dream of surfing 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.160
 it can never become reality but it is 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.160
 just like that 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.140
 look at this model the killer 4.5 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.850
 always built is 4 meters long and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.430
 half a meter wide and 63 weighs 220 kg 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.040
 therefore it is easy to move on board 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.230
 they can climb 4 people have it 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.739
 motorized with a forest outboard 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.309
 obviously from 9.9 horses and all the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 package costs 3,700 euros as one 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 medium displacement scooter 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 the Italian engine manufacturer 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.480
 outboard jungle to a range of boats and 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.910
 rather large inflatable boats that includes 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.910
 hulls up to 10 meters in length 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.110
 I chose to try a boat of 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.450
 intermediate band 6.7 elegance that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.680
 for many fans it represents a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.930
 point of arrival 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.630
 obviously you can choose models 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.730
 even bigger, but this one has it all 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 what you need to spend one 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.810
 day on the water 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.030
 to try this boat we have 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.820
 available an outboard engine 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.710
 they serve 150 horses 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:50.560
 you have seen the writing xfr is an abbreviation 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.560
 which emphasizes a certain sportiness 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.790
 maybe not everyone knows that the company 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.880
 selva was born from the passion of his 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.310
 founder for competitions and even if 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.610
 since then there have been three 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.840
 generations in the spirit dna 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.120
 the motor is still present 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.330
 it is produced by yamaha and of course 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.989
 also sold by the Japanese giant but 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.520
 say that this 150 horses signed 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.310
 selva has something more 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.650
 the agreements between the two companies provide for 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.500
 the supply by sella to yamaha 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.810
 of components for small engines 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.210
 then an Italian company 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.970
 produces components and systems 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.570
 production also for other famous i 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.570
 builders 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.230
 every time we test a boat 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.660
 we have two purposes to verify the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.920
 engine performance and those of the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.150
 hull on the 6.7 elegance of selva there is a 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.120
 beautiful solarium on the bow 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.690
 but if you want you can remove a part of it 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.400
 and sit in front of the console 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.360
 they paid attention to safety and 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.190
 mounted railing is rather high there 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.930
 they are also handrails next to the sofa 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.159
 of stern 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.310
 you can have a snack 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.170
 comfortably seated or take advantage of the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.170
 table to make a sundress 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.090
 under the console there is a compartment that can 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.400
 be set up as a bathroom for i 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.299
 there are various luggage and equipment 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.730
 summer 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.140
 look at how shiny the inside of the is 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.140
 bow locker 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.270
 aft there is a large cove and behind the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.260
 sofa a sink to wash the 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.970
 caught 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.790
 I already raimi turns into a seat 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.959
 with back and under there is another 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.959
 sink and a locker 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.260
 we return to our test we find ourselves 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.420
 on the lake of Como in the northernmost part 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.200
 and pulls a very strong wind with gusts 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.900
 of over 25 knots that raise reste 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.049
 parted steep waves a condition that 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.310
 we will work hard enough 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:27.639
 place your hand on the gas lever 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:33.100
 to go on a glide 2.400 laps 10 knots 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:35.500
 the boat is already in fact the fact that 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.860
 we have a corner of ticino incidence 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.110
 that ideal also in vaping gait 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.389
 Trento but the bow cabri not inflated 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.389
 on the water it is already very positive 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.530
 and interesting to note how despite 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.430
 these gusts of very strong wind e 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.210
 a speed that is now 20 knots a 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.390
 There are not all 3200 engine revs a 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.390
 board 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.760
 this is the chosen cruising speed 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.090
 by most boaters 25 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.150
 knots 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.070
 but with this contrary wind I did 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.950
 seems to go already 100 kilometers 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.870
 then 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:23.200
 since the motor a is given at 25 knots 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.390
 3,800 rpm and consumed 25 liters now so 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.670
 you have no problem calculating 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:32.800
 one liter autonomy for easy video 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.780
 with an engine, however, it is so powerful 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.720
 cruising speed can be a lot 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.510
 higher for example 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.710
 let's get to the maximum speed 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.710
 continuous provided by the manufacturer 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.890
 and here we are at 4,800 rpm 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.890
 34 fires 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.570
 aim rather flat without bending 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:07.230
 without skidding a situation 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:11.070
 comfortable for passengers have 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:14.520
 some skew feels like the engine 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.690
 it is beautiful full couple and power who I am 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.690
 they are all there 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.570
 the driving position is comfortable 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.540
 instruments are blessed the compass in 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.139
 giving the command within reach with fear 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.080
 of hand 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.210
 let's eat up some now 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.949
 of the characteristics but we want 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.949
 give up trying the maximum speed 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:53.070
 the tachometer also such speed 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.070
 38 knots 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.250
 the 6.7 elegance of selva turned out to be 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.530
 a versatile and functional boat that can 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.320
 be made even more comfortable by one 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.840
 long list of accessories from the winch 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.310
 electric which is very convenient to the 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.530
 hydraulic steering system 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.530
 the choice is yours and then good fun
