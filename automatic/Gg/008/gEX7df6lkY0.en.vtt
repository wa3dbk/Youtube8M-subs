the ruined glaive and loons echo was

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.779 
the ruined glaive and loons echo was
actually<00:00:27.210> flavor<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> month<00:00:28.619> which<00:00:29.609> of

actually flavor of the month which of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.400 
actually flavor of the month which of
course<00:00:29.820> got<00:00:30.269> nerfed<00:00:30.449> quickly<00:00:30.990> because

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
course got nerfed quickly because

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.500 
course got nerfed quickly because
anything<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:31.980> viable<00:00:32.369> has<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.300> nerfed

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
anything that's viable has to get nerfed

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
anything that's viable has to get nerfed
I<00:00:34.399> played<00:00:35.399> him<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> good<00:00:35.940> old<00:00:36.120> fashioned

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I played him the good old fashioned

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.319 
I played him the good old fashioned
attack<00:00:37.140> damage<00:00:37.410> bot<00:00:37.860> Lane<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> although<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
attack damage bot Lane and although I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
attack damage bot Lane and although I
still<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:40.110> he's<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.770> weaker<00:00:41.160> pick

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
still think he's kind of a weaker pick

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
still think he's kind of a weaker pick
as<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> marksman<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.750> changed<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> few<00:00:43.890> things

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
as a marksman I changed a few things

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.090 
as a marksman I changed a few things
around<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.640> his<00:00:45.000> items<00:00:45.440> for<00:00:46.440> starters<00:00:46.860> I'm

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
around with his items for starters I'm

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
around with his items for starters I'm
sure<00:00:47.399> most<00:00:47.610> people<00:00:47.969> already<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.899> tier

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
sure most people already know that tier

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
sure most people already know that tier
is<00:00:49.770> actually<00:00:50.309> good<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.670> Israel<00:00:51.210> simply

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
is actually good on Israel simply

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410 
is actually good on Israel simply
because<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.829> Murrah<00:00:53.070> manner<00:00:53.309> damage<00:00:53.789> later

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
because the Murrah manner damage later

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
because the Murrah manner damage later
on<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.079> super<00:00:55.829> important<00:00:56.309> combined<00:00:57.059> with

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
on is super important combined with

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.380 
on is super important combined with
trinity<00:00:57.809> force<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.350> mystic<00:00:58.859> shot<00:00:59.210> instead<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
trinity force and mystic shot instead of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
trinity force and mystic shot instead of
always<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> blood<00:01:01.559> first<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> now

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
always going for a blood first and now

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.820 
always going for a blood first and now
as<00:01:02.520> well<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.390> sometimes<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.350> blade<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
as well I also sometimes get blade of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
as well I also sometimes get blade of
the<00:01:04.860> ruined<00:01:05.159> King<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:06.390> he<00:01:06.420> needs<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the ruined King because he needs that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
the ruined King because he needs that
against<00:01:07.710> bruises<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.490> tanks<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.810> one

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
against bruises or tanks and that's one

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
against bruises or tanks and that's one
thing<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.350> I've<00:01:10.619> hated<00:01:10.799> about<00:01:11.159> Israel<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
thing that I've hated about Israel is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
thing that I've hated about Israel is
how<00:01:12.420> bad<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.750> does<00:01:13.200> against<00:01:13.710> tanky<00:01:14.100> champions

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
how bad he does against tanky champions

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
how bad he does against tanky champions
I<00:01:14.909> mean<00:01:15.360> sure<00:01:15.630> he<00:01:15.900> could<00:01:16.020> try<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> run<00:01:16.650> away<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
I mean sure he could try to run away and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.020 
I mean sure he could try to run away and
quiet<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> death<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.630> about<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
quiet them to death but that's about it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
quiet them to death but that's about it
another<00:01:21.030> thing<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.020> Israel

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
another thing as well is that Israel

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.670 
another thing as well is that Israel
still<00:01:23.220> sucks<00:01:23.640> late-game<00:01:23.970> most<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> marksman

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
still sucks late-game most of a marksman

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
still sucks late-game most of a marksman
or<00:01:25.979> other<00:01:26.280> champions<00:01:26.759> will<00:01:27.090> easily<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.840> able

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
or other champions will easily be able

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.100 
or other champions will easily be able
to<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.530> damage<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.130> role<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.729> 1v1<00:01:30.150> since
