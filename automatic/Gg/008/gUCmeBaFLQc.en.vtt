 a lot of danger 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.780
 it's open their minds from students to culture and then of course 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.019
 to establish projects and cultural in partnership with two professors at 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.430

 the social and cultural structure 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.440
 all this has a rather particular background and there it is really a 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.100
 reorientation 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.799
 for those who followed a rather long reflection made on the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.640
 comes out but in the middle of a professional career what interests me and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.340
 Here we can be useful to children who are 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.550
 days 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.530

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 but it is the only one that can be quite restrictive it's a fatigability
