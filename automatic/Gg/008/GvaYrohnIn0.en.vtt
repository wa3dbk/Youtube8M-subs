00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.169 

all<00:00:01.439> right<00:00:01.620> guys<00:00:01.829> so<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.580> looking<00:00:03.060> at<00:00:03.120> my

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
all right guys so I'm looking at my

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.619 
all right guys so I'm looking at my
tomato<00:00:03.840> plants<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.529> my<00:00:05.160> borage<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.390> I'm

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
tomato plants and my borage and I'm

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.390 
tomato plants and my borage and I'm
noticing<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.649> leaves<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:08.160> just

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
noticing that the leaves are just

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700 
noticing that the leaves are just
starting<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.210> turn<00:00:09.450> yellow<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.960> little<00:00:10.320> bit<00:00:10.469> in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
starting to turn yellow a little bit in

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.040 
starting to turn yellow a little bit in
between<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> veins

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.230 

so<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:18.620> think<00:00:18.710> they're<00:00:19.130> a<00:00:19.160> little<00:00:19.580> bit<00:00:19.790> nutrient

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
so I think they're a little bit nutrient

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.060 
so I think they're a little bit nutrient
deficient<00:00:20.690> so<00:00:20.990> what<00:00:21.140> I'm<00:00:21.230> gonna<00:00:21.350> do<00:00:21.590> is<00:00:21.830> whip

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
deficient so what I'm gonna do is whip

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.330 
deficient so what I'm gonna do is whip
up<00:00:22.280> a<00:00:23.020> organic<00:00:24.070> readily<00:00:25.070> available<00:00:27.340> seedling

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
up a organic readily available seedling

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.250 
up a organic readily available seedling
fertilizer<00:00:28.940> and<00:00:29.510> I'll<00:00:29.630> show<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:29.900> how<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.110> do

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
fertilizer and I'll show you how to do

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.330 
fertilizer and I'll show you how to do
that<00:00:30.440> I<00:00:31.720> looked<00:00:32.720> online<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.440> I<00:00:33.500> saw<00:00:33.739> all<00:00:33.920> kinds

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
that I looked online and I saw all kinds

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.930 
that I looked online and I saw all kinds
of<00:00:34.460> great<00:00:35.680> homemade<00:00:36.680> fertilizers<00:00:37.489> using

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
of great homemade fertilizers using

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.640 
of great homemade fertilizers using
seaweed<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.750> all<00:00:38.930> different<00:00:39.080> kinds<00:00:39.320> of

at the grocery store and I think I said
one<00:01:23.569> tablespoon<00:01:24.229> I<00:01:24.380> hope<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.709> did<00:01:25.720> one

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720

emulsion and this is gonna supply some

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:41.410 
emulsion and this is gonna supply some
nitrogen<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:38.709> believe<00:01:39.709> its<00:01:39.860> nitrogen<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.670> don't

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
nitrogen I believe its nitrogen I don't

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.350 
nitrogen I believe its nitrogen I don't
really<00:01:41.539> know<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.810> just<00:01:42.110> know<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.350> works<00:01:43.360> put

what that's gonna give me is a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.100 
what that's gonna give me is a
five-to-one<00:02:03.770> fertilizer<00:02:04.720> because<00:02:05.720> normally

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
five-to-one fertilizer because normally

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.100 
five-to-one fertilizer because normally
in<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.319> summer<00:02:07.090> well<00:02:08.090> what<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.390> did<00:02:08.660> last<00:02:08.899> year

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
in the summer well what I did last year

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.110 
in the summer well what I did last year
is<00:02:09.349> like<00:02:09.530> would<00:02:09.740> take<00:02:10.039> one<00:02:10.310> tablespoon<00:02:10.580> of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
is like would take one tablespoon of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.380 
is like would take one tablespoon of
Epsom<00:02:11.480> salt<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.020> fish<00:02:12.740> fertilizer<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:14.180> add

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
Epsom salt and fish fertilizer and add

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.360 
Epsom salt and fish fertilizer and add
it<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.599> between<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.590> two<00:02:15.860> gallons<00:02:16.280> of

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
it to between one and two gallons of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.339 
it to between one and two gallons of
water<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.819> water<00:02:17.209> my<00:02:17.450> peppers<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.080> they<00:02:18.170> did

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
water to water my peppers and they did

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.530 
water to water my peppers and they did
really<00:02:18.380> good<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.540> they've

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
really good with that and they've

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.680 
really good with that and they've
already<00:02:20.720> got<00:02:20.870> dirt<00:02:21.380> out<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.250> garden<00:02:23.030> but

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
already got dirt out in the garden but

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.270 
already got dirt out in the garden but
I'm<00:02:23.840> using<00:02:24.020> these<00:02:24.230> peat<00:02:24.530> pellets<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.130> there's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
I'm using these peat pellets and there's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.070 
I'm using these peat pellets and there's
really<00:02:25.430> no<00:02:25.640> dirt<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.150> there<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.750> they're

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
really no dirt in there so they're

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.170 
really no dirt in there so they're
lacking<00:02:27.290> all<00:02:27.650> those<00:02:27.830> little<00:02:28.180> micronutrients

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
lacking all those little micronutrients

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.770 
lacking all those little micronutrients
that<00:02:29.390> are<00:02:30.050> available<00:02:30.410> in

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
that are available in

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.350 
that are available in
just<00:02:32.780> regular<00:02:33.170> dirt<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.709> compost<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.180> that's

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
just regular dirt and compost so that's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.319 
just regular dirt and compost so that's
why<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.599> put<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.959> dirt<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.319> here<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.180> it's<00:02:38.180> a

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
why I put the dirt in here and it's a

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.149 
why I put the dirt in here and it's a
five<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.840> one

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
five to one

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.580 
five to one
well<00:02:40.579> it's<00:02:40.730> diluted<00:02:41.180> 1/5<00:02:41.870> because<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.290> don't

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
well it's diluted 1/5 because I don't

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.740 
well it's diluted 1/5 because I don't

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
to put a little bit of fertilizer in

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.130 
to put a little bit of fertilizer in
there<00:02:46.579> just<00:02:47.180> enough<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.689> keep<00:02:47.900> them<00:02:48.079> going

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
there just enough to keep them going

until<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.980> get<00:02:49.129> them<00:02:49.250> outside<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.769> then

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
until I can get them outside and then

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.420 
until I can get them outside and then
right<00:03:01.400> before<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.790> water<00:03:02.060> I'll<00:03:02.359> stir<00:03:02.689> it<00:03:02.720> up<00:03:03.430> to

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
right before I water I'll stir it up to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.300 
right before I water I'll stir it up to
get<00:03:04.579> all<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.940> top<00:03:05.840> soil<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.470> compost<00:03:06.650> and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
manure that I put in there because

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.180 
manure that I put in there because
that's<00:03:10.489> what's<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.000> topsoil<00:03:12.010> get<00:03:13.010> that

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
worked up into the water micronutrients

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.649 
worked up into the water micronutrients
and<00:03:21.379> microbes<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.099> stuff<00:03:22.340> they<00:03:22.489> need<00:03:22.730> now

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
and microbes and stuff they need now

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.890
