into a sort of Microsoft period where

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
into a sort of Microsoft period where
the<00:01:50.820> company<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.420> make<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> ton<00:01:51.930> of

the company might well make a ton of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
the company might well make a ton of

money but it no longer captures the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
money but it no longer captures the
imagination<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.649> we've<00:01:55.799> seen

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
imagination and I think what we've seen

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
imagination and I think what we've seen
is<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> Apple<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.810> struggling<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> cap

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
is that Apple is struggling now to cap

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
is that Apple is struggling now to cap
city<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> take<00:01:58.950> risks<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
city but you have to take risks to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.010 
city but you have to take risks to
capture<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> imagination<00:02:00.689> yes<00:02:00.840> then

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
capture the imagination yes then

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
capture the imagination yes then
sometimes<00:02:01.500> risks<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.130> pay<00:02:02.340> off<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
sometimes risks don't pay off and you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.399 
sometimes risks don't pay off and you
fix<00:02:03.030> them<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.719> bugs<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.229> move

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
fix them and there are bugs and you move

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.870 
fix them and there are bugs and you move
on<00:02:04.560> well<00:02:04.950> precisely<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.460> problems<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> they

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
on well precisely the problems that they

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
on well precisely the problems that they
haven't<00:02:06.000> taken<00:02:06.180> any<00:02:06.420> risks<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> phone<00:02:07.049> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
haven't taken any risks the phone is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.660 
haven't taken any risks the phone is
almost<00:02:07.500> identical<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> previous<00:02:08.160> model<00:02:08.520> i

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
almost identical to the previous model i

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.100 
almost identical to the previous model i
was<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.879> bit<00:02:09.030> bigger<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> bit<00:02:09.539> thinner<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
was a bit bigger in a bit thinner so it

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.240 
was a bit bigger in a bit thinner so it
bends<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> course<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.979> made<00:02:11.129> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
bends because of course is made of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.270 
bends because of course is made of
aluminium<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.849> think

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
aluminium what do you think

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.270 
aluminium what do you think
do<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.690> youtube<00:02:14.440> partnership<00:02:14.950> was

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
do you know that youtube partnership was

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.340 
do you know that youtube partnership was
incredibly<00:02:16.180> safe<00:02:16.390> choice<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.110> watch

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
incredibly safe choice the watch

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.680 
incredibly safe choice the watch
incredibly<00:02:18.220> safe<00:02:18.490> designed<00:02:18.910> precisely<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
incredibly safe designed precisely the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.180 
incredibly safe designed precisely the
problem<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.170> they<00:02:20.380> haven't<00:02:20.620> taken<00:02:20.920> risks

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
problem is that they haven't taken risks

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.920 
problem is that they haven't taken risks
like<00:02:21.520> they<00:02:21.640> did<00:02:21.819> with<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> ipod<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.780> they

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
like they did with the ipod like they

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.449 
like they did with the ipod like they
did<00:02:23.140> with<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> iphone<00:02:23.709> like<00:02:23.920> they<00:02:24.069> did<00:02:24.310> with

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
did with the iphone like they did with

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.860 
did with the iphone like they did with
the<00:02:24.580> tablet<00:02:24.940> i<00:02:25.060> mean<00:02:25.330> when<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:25.480> introduced

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
the tablet i mean when they introduced

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.240 
the tablet i mean when they introduced
the<00:02:25.959> ipad<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.380> was<00:02:26.470> an<00:02:26.560> extraordinary<00:02:26.860> thing

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
the ipad it was an extraordinary thing

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.100 
the ipad it was an extraordinary thing
because<00:02:27.520> they're<00:02:27.880> being<00:02:28.120> tablets<00:02:28.540> around<00:02:28.840> for

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
because they're being tablets around for

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.660 
because they're being tablets around for
years<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.680> they've<00:02:29.800> never<00:02:30.130> taken<00:02:30.400> off

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
years and they've never taken off

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.160 
years and they've never taken off
everybody<00:02:31.239> had<00:02:31.360> written<00:02:31.600> off<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.900> whole

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
everybody had written off that whole

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.840 
everybody had written off that whole
segment<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.620> market<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.160> Apple<00:02:33.520> came<00:02:33.700> in

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
segment of the market and Apple came in

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.020 
segment of the market and Apple came in
and<00:02:34.030> made<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.600> multi-million<00:02:35.500> dollar

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and made it a multi-million dollar

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.670 
and made it a multi-million dollar
market<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.330> other<00:02:37.569> other<00:02:37.900> manufacturers

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
market that other other manufacturers

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.580 
market that other other manufacturers
within<00:02:39.220> desperate<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.819> get<00:02:39.910> back<00:02:40.090> into<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:41.050> no

within desperate to get back into but no

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.199 
within desperate to get back into but no
precisely<00:02:42.100> because<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.670> didn't<00:02:42.910> take<00:02:43.000> any

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
precisely because they didn't take any

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.880 
precisely because they didn't take any
risks<00:02:43.600> they're<00:02:43.900> no<00:02:44.110> longer<00:02:44.230> exciting<00:02:44.769> people

risks they're no longer exciting people
