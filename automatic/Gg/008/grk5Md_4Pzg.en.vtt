I'm just going to go to a gradient tool
there<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.850> I'm<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.210> select<00:00:21.330> the

gradients from here and the ones I'm
using<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.580> special<00:00:26.580> effects<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.810> its

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

first one special effects and it's the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.069 
first one special effects and it's the
gray<00:00:31.170> value<00:00:31.199> stripes<00:00:32.239> using<00:00:33.239> difference<00:00:33.750> and

I'm<00:00:34.500> using<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> angled<00:00:35.340> option<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:36.329> just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
I'm using the angled option I'm just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.940 
I'm using the angled option I'm just
going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> quickly<00:00:36.899> apply<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:39.110> few<00:00:40.110> times<00:00:40.440> just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
going to quickly apply a few times just

quite<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> very<00:00:41.430> fragmented<00:00:41.879> design<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
quite a very fragmented design for the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
quite a very fragmented design for the
stained<00:00:43.350> glass<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> go

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
stained glass and I'm just going to go

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
stained glass and I'm just going to go
over<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> red<00:00:46.289> channel<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> using

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
over to the red channel this is using

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.740 
over to the red channel this is using
the<00:00:47.640> channels<00:00:48.000> palette<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.390> can't<00:00:48.570> see

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the channels palette if you can't see

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
the channels palette if you can't see
that<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> window<00:00:50.870> channels<00:00:52.340> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that just go to the window channels so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
that just go to the window channels so
just<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:56.510> green<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.160> quite<00:00:59.160> another

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just like that green and quite another

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.490 
just like that green and quite another
bit<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> fragmentation<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.660> blue

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.750 

maybe<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.710> bit<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.670> over<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:10.760> right

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
maybe a bit more just over there right

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.600 
maybe a bit more just over there right
now<00:01:12.540> I've<00:01:12.630> done<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.260> said<00:01:13.710> quite<00:01:13.920> reuse<00:01:14.460> me

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
now I've done that I said quite reuse me

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
now I've done that I said quite reuse me
colorful<00:01:15.030> design<00:01:15.720> already<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:16.680> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
colorful design already and I'm just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.890 
colorful design already and I'm just
gonna<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.790> filter<00:01:19.280> artistic<00:01:20.900> post

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
gonna go to the filter artistic post

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
gonna go to the filter artistic post

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
apply different color effects if you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.180 
apply different color effects if you
decide<00:02:14.049> that<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.470> not<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:14.980> what<00:02:15.099> you
