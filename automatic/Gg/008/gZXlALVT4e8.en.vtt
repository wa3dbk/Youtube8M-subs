00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 Thank you, I am Daling. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.300
 But all of a sudden, everyone is a compact digital camera, what about you? 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.640
 Although I use digital single-lens reflex, Kedomo you only need to shop around, you want to immediately sub-digital camera, 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 This time, to determine the super subjective of a compact digital camera, 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.220
 We will check the camera and say, "If I buy this camera." 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.600
 At this point, but will continue to be delivered twice or three times as it becomes longer, 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.000
 It seems that it will be part of the low-cost compact digital camera that is less than 30,000 yen at this time. 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.880
 "Canon IXY630" 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.220
 "Sony's Cyber ​​- shot DSC-WX350" 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.940
 "Nikon COOLPIX S9700" 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.820
 "Casio HIGH SPEED EXILIM EX-ZR850" 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.900
 We will focus on the five models of the Fujifilm FinePix S1. 

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:06.308
 First of all, when I bought a camera, first as a point, it should be the most important "quality". 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.840
 Then there is a "motion image performance." 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 There are others, but this time I tried to check the two points of each model. 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.880
 It should be noted that at this time, in addition to the manufacturer's website comparison, kakaku.com's comments and photos are for reference. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.520
 The price has been announced, I want to point out that it is the lowest editing time for kakaku.com. 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.120
 Ok, so we will first look into the "Canon IXY630". 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 And the lowest price is £10,779 but the IXY630 is the most expensive model in the model introduced here 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 It and the number of shots are small, that is, the lens is darker than other models. 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.040
 Video performance is also quite mediocre, and the main use is somewhat possible, if it is impossible, even if the sub-camera has become a performance. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.480
 Start-up time only I think that compared to other models, the only feature is to enter the fast class. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.120
 After Canon recently it is making it often not taking the sample image to the product page 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.320
 This is an important criterion for "quality" that cannot be confirmed. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.240
 Satisfaction at kartaku.com at 3.92 seems to be disappointing image quality just looking at the photos that have been posted. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.760
 The following is "Sony's Cyber-shot DSC-WX350" 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.100
 The lowest price is very cheap yen 18300, but Sony seems to be a very stylish look. 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.500
 The number of pixels is also the highest of this comparison in the model, 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.160
 The number of both weight and size shots has often become a sharp product that seems to be Sony's smallest and lightest in the world. 

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:31.174
 Because even watching video performance, the ability to record 60P full HD may be unusual considering digital cameras in this price range. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.760
 In particular, in the image quality, as long as the image is in the official sample, but the usual is not bad, 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.760
 This is where it happens, or in actual use only interested in a low sensitivity shot. 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.520
 Next, I will continue to watch the Nikon COOLPIX S9700. 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.520
 In particular, there is no function for the specification, but there is no sample image on the official website of the S9700. 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.260
 Satisfaction when kakaku.com, this seems to be the best quality of the five modes and photos have been posted there 4.14 photos that think there is a tidbit 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.360
 And it is equivalent to the image quality in this price range. 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.660
 Ballmer is also sharp and moderate, I think, I think we can go in the Lord, not some people. 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.040
 Ok, what is the "Casio HIGH SPEED EXILIM EX-ZR800"? 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.320
 When I saw the first specification, this camera is characterized by what I think is "speed." 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.000
 Startups are also fast enough to focus on fast and video and or create a lens in super slow motion images up to 1000FPS, 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.940
 I think I will make a so-called missile-specific camera. 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.920
 However, if you check the official website of Jingjing, you can not only shoot in up to manual mode. 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 Shooting in RAW can also be really amazing here. 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.960
 RAW shot from around and Kondeji luxury Nantes, but it has a fixed concept of'm almost impossible, 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.060
 No way like a dream to do RAW shooting at this price camera. 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.600
 By the way, RAW is because it compares JPEG with a typical colorful information, hoping to change the color from later, to those who say that you want to edit is the best file format. 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.540
 The lens is a bright balance of filial piety. 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.700
 But, a little subtle is... because it's not a particularly clean looking image with only samples 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.100
 But with kakaku.com satisfaction is very high 4.69, 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.580
 The comment also said that very positive things are only in the performance of this camera. 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.420
 Finally, we will look at the Fujifilm FinePix S1. 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.360
 Both size and weight may be mistaken for a single-lens reflex camera unlike other, 50x zoom, bright lenses, 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.300
 It has full HD 60P video, packed with more features that match dust, drip and size. 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.760
 And, through or has become possible here also shooting manual shooting and RAW, features and specific performance, but I know that this camera is undisputed 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480
 The bottom line of image quality is not so good, 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.520
 Many sample images are confirmed without noise, 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.560
 Even in the ISO100-like noise, there is no precious RAW feeling during the daytime outdoors. Yes, it is a very disappointing model... in this sense. 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.600
 You feel, 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.820
 This time, I tried to explore the use of this feature in a variety of models, the current camera zoom function and camera shake correction function is also cheap, 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.000
 In addition, for example, WiFi installation 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.740
 I think more and more good models are compared to old days. 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.860
 But if I dare to buy it at this time 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.260
 Select "HIGH SPEED EXILIM EX-ZR850" Casio. 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.660
 Actually, I have to go at the beginning, including short alignment, 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.420
 This is a Chinese character that is attracting expensive and good to check. 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.180
 "Nikon COOLPIX S9700", in the runner-up 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.000
 "Sony's Cyber ​​- shot DSC-WX350" 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.380
 "Fuji FinePix S1" 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.220
 Finally, the order will be in the "Canon IXY630". 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.900
 It is over, 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.240
 So, next time I want to see the mid-range price of the compact digital camera, because please look there too. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.000
 Goodbye.
