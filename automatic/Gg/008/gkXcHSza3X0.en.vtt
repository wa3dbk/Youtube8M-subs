00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.879
 is to grow 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.490
 good good good good new episode 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.849
 of crisis and posters we are with scape 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:20.289
 game plan developed by interactive 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.810
 which is available in 400 store I do not know 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.550
 what is your current condition if your state was 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 Normal price is 12 euros from CÃ³rdoba 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.920
 and I think it's cheaper for free, not what 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.300
 I know but well the controls are very 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.220
 simple you just have to carry 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.690
 to the character that you control from the part 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.449
 left from the room to the side 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.460
 right and without too much show much 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.980
 people that graphically you need this 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.530
 for some and four can not move anymore 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.540
 things graphically what is right is 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.129
 do the style for example is very 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.890
 particular and reminds us to 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.180
 tim burton movies or something like that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.350
 similar to that to that kind of thing 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.170
 technically you can pull and push 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.550
 objects to touch objects also well then 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.770
 depending on the character you are wearing 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.690
 control or change it with the l1 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.840
 you can also run but that's what 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:17.350
 We will see now if you drink a coffee 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 very good because you play 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.360
 coffee but how do you run to avoid 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.470
 trap is that if we are a little bit we can 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.600
 see we do some things and it looks 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.810
 much to this to them or dis and that's why 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.110
 took out this little fragment here in the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.150
 maps in 2d we can not attack we can not 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.940
 attack anyone but the team diaz 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.500
 owns the other characters really that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.230
 It reminds me a lot of the type of game 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.620
 because it is in lateral perspective in 2d 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.730
 although this one in this case is rather 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.310
 222 dimensions and a half say 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.060
 we also use in the course of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.060
 parental control 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.179
 that has precision 4 we use it for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.939
 move things like in this case move the 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.140
 lever to pull it forward 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.390
 this is the other chrome character for 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.150
 end up using the later is 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.769
 another the alcc that are the names the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 names of the characters that the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.569
 men of the defects beings that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.819
 they share this world and the truth is that 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.860
 It's very cool because being a game 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.750
 indie we see that playstation 4 has 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.540
 bet a lot on indie games and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.569
 this in this case is what he gets is 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.430
 what is proposed is to say that beat 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.349
 it tells you is that you play a long time and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.940
 especially that makes you think how can I 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.799
 pass me this screen if I can not attack 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.750
 I'm not a character who can 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.540
 He could not jump jump I can not do 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.310
 practically nothing but the four 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.230
 things that you can do walking jump to 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.700
 jumping for forgiveness pulling you ass is what 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.769
 can do for example the edge of this 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.840
 and that 's because you can not do 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.290
 that's why they make you think a lot and 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.000
 that's the nice thing about skate plan that you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.500
 entertains makes you have you give 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.599
 returns to the head and especially has 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.129
 that trip of the games let's say of 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.660
 late 90's that I liked 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.050
 as much as 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.120
 sodi yes no 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.180

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.770
