really<00:01:26.700> trying<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:27.780> think<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.350> too

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
really trying but I don't think it's too

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
really trying but I don't think it's too
bad<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.280> thing<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.729> me<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
bad because the thing is with me is I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
bad because the thing is with me is I
always<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.140> lip<00:01:31.290> balm<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.680> morning<00:01:32.250> night<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
always put lip balm on morning night and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
always put lip balm on morning night and
before<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> apply<00:01:33.509> lipstick<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.170> they're

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
before I apply lipstick so they're

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.870 
before I apply lipstick so they're
always<00:01:34.740> moisturizing<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.670> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
always moisturizing they don't really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
always moisturizing they don't really
don't<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> chance<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.020> dried<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
don't get a chance to get dried if that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
don't get a chance to get dried if that
makes<00:01:37.770> sense<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.159> bit<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> lip<00:01:39.299> balm

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479

the<00:03:13.519> staying<00:03:13.819> power<00:03:13.910> isn't<00:03:14.330> great<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:15.019> guess<00:03:15.290> if

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the staying power isn't great I guess if

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.140 
the staying power isn't great I guess if
you're<00:03:15.709> kind<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.250> just<00:03:16.459> wearing<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.000> and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.920 
you haven't eaten you have drunk drunk
anything<00:03:19.160> then<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.030> stays<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.329> quite<00:03:20.540> well
