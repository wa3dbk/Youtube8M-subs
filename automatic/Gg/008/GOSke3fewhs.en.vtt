00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.539 
out and say yeah it's gonna be that guy
so<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.720> know<00:04:14.900> maybe<00:04:15.319> they<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.769> finagle<00:04:16.280> away

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
so you know maybe they can finagle away

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.370 
so you know maybe they can finagle away
but<00:04:16.940> Luke<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.299> find<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:17.660> hard<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.870> believe<00:04:17.989> and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
but Luke I find it hard to believe and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.900 
but Luke I find it hard to believe and
september's<00:04:18.950> if<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.310> think<00:04:19.489> about<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.700> in<00:04:19.850> the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
september's if you think about it in the

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.099 
september's if you think about it in the
box<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.239> well<00:04:20.389> that's<00:04:20.479> kind<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.840> right<00:04:21.019> around

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
box and well that's kind of right around

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.659 
box and well that's kind of right around
the<00:04:21.289> corner<00:04:21.560> in<00:04:21.650> terms<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.950> guys<00:04:22.340> getting

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
the corner in terms of guys getting

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.100 
the corner in terms of guys getting
ready<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.150> fights<00:04:23.360> being<00:04:23.630> announced<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
ready and fights being announced and

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.450 
ready and fights being announced and
promoted<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:24.710> forth<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.310> we're

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
promoted and so forth and so we're

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.350 
promoted and so forth and so we're
really<00:04:25.700> wondering

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
really wondering

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.430 
really wondering
what<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.420> you<00:04:27.510> think<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.810> next<00:04:28.050> for<00:04:28.140> him<00:04:28.260> if<00:04:28.350> you

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
what do you think is next for him if you

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.560 
what do you think is next for him if you
could<00:04:28.530> really<00:04:28.860> sort<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.100> pinpoint<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:30.360> he

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
could really sort of pinpoint it if he

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.300 
could really sort of pinpoint it if he
does<00:04:30.780> fight<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.170> September<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.680> think<00:04:32.040> it's<00:04:32.160> got

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
does fight in September I think it's got

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.830 
does fight in September I think it's got
to<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.460> key<00:04:32.670> Thurman<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.150> think<00:04:33.360> Keith<00:04:33.600> Thurman

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
to be key Thurman I think Keith Thurman

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.990 
to be key Thurman I think Keith Thurman
would<00:04:34.170> be<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.410> most<00:04:34.590> logical<00:04:34.860> guy<00:04:35.340> out<00:04:35.610> there

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
would be the most logical guy out there

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.480 
would be the most logical guy out there
Thurman<00:04:36.630> isn't<00:04:36.930> where<00:04:37.380> he<00:04:37.500> needs<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.920> at<00:04:38.280> in

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
Thurman isn't where he needs to be at in

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.220 
Thurman isn't where he needs to be at in
terms<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.910> notoriety<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.540> think<00:04:39.780> he's<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.930> very

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
terms of notoriety I think he's a very

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.500 
terms of notoriety I think he's a very
good<00:04:40.500> very<00:04:40.650> up-and-coming<00:04:41.220> guy<00:04:41.490> but<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
good very up-and-coming guy but the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.970 
good very up-and-coming guy but the
world<00:04:42.720> doesn't<00:04:42.990> know<00:04:43.230> him<00:04:43.380> enough<00:04:43.440> yet<00:04:43.800> but

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
world doesn't know him enough yet but

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.710 
world doesn't know him enough yet but
they're<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.310> know<00:04:44.370> Aamir<00:04:45.120> Khan<00:04:45.360> would<00:04:45.540> be<00:04:45.690> a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
they're you know Aamir Khan would be a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.770 
they're you know Aamir Khan would be a
possibility<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:46.620> he's<00:04:46.890> got<00:04:47.670> Ramadan<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:48.690> he

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
possibility but he's got Ramadan so he

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.940 
possibility but he's got Ramadan so he
doesn't<00:04:49.080> fight<00:04:49.260> in<00:04:49.410> September<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.860> know

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
doesn't fight in September you know

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.130 
doesn't fight in September you know
maybe<00:04:50.220> Kell<00:04:50.610> Brook<00:04:50.640> but<00:04:51.120> Brook<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.630> even<00:04:51.870> less

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
maybe Kell Brook but Brook is even less

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.630 
maybe Kell Brook but Brook is even less
known<00:04:52.410> because<00:04:52.680> he's<00:04:52.860> British<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.400> doesn't

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
known because he's British and doesn't

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.060 
known because he's British and doesn't
fight<00:04:53.790> in<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.000> US<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:55.110> key<00:04:55.320> Thurman<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.830> so

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
fight in the US the key Thurman is so

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.620 
fight in the US the key Thurman is so
they<00:04:56.460> don't<00:04:56.640> have<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.790> lot<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.060> great<00:04:57.360> options

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
they don't have a lot of great options

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.570 
they don't have a lot of great options
and<00:04:58.020> if<00:04:58.200> PAC<00:04:58.440> yells<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.919> shelf<00:04:59.160> he's<00:04:59.370> out

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
and if PAC yells on the shelf he's out

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.280 
and if PAC yells on the shelf he's out
so<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.060> would<00:05:00.419> think<00:05:00.540> Thurman<00:05:00.930> would<00:05:01.080> be<00:05:01.169> the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
so I would think Thurman would be the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.930 
so I would think Thurman would be the
guy<00:05:01.440> all<00:05:01.860> right<00:05:02.010> Kevin<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:02.400> got<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.640> get<00:05:02.730> out<00:05:02.820> of
