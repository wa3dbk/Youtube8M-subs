and<00:02:58.060> while<00:02:58.180> getting<00:02:58.450> back<00:02:58.659> over<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.049> other

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
and while getting back over to the other

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.890 
and while getting back over to the other
side<00:02:59.439> plate<00:02:59.769> there<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.099> can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.459> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
side plate there you can see the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.559 
side plate there you can see the
engraved<00:03:01.900> wrestlers<00:03:02.379> again<00:03:02.769> with<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.569> skids

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
engraved wrestlers again with the skids

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.600 
engraved wrestlers again with the skids
shot<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:04.989> stacked<00:03:05.349> plate<00:03:05.709> how<00:03:05.950> thick

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
shot of that stacked plate how thick

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.479 
shot of that stacked plate how thick
these<00:03:06.819> plates<00:03:07.120> are<00:03:07.329> cos<00:03:08.129> unless<00:03:09.129> requested

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
these plates are cos unless requested

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.699 
these plates are cos unless requested
otherwise<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:11.079> of<00:03:11.110> our<00:03:11.260> plates<00:03:11.530> are

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
otherwise you know all of our plates are

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.130 
otherwise you know all of our plates are
four<00:03:11.950> millimeters<00:03:12.189> thick<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.659> even<00:03:14.019> my

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
four millimeters thick so even my

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.479 
four millimeters thick so even my
stacked<00:03:14.470> plates<00:03:14.620> are<00:03:14.950> another<00:03:15.189> four

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
stacked plates are another four

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.009 
stacked plates are another four
millimeters<00:03:16.000> thick<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.659> makes<00:03:16.870> this

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
millimeters thick so that makes this

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.089 
millimeters thick so that makes this
side<00:03:17.349> pleat<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:19.000> main<00:03:19.269> plate<00:03:19.569> here<00:03:23.099> very

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
side pleat and this main plate here very

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.520 
side pleat and this main plate here very
thick<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.540> don't<00:03:25.780> probably<00:03:26.079> weighs<00:03:26.230> in

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
thick so this don't probably weighs in

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.619 
thick so this don't probably weighs in
at<00:03:26.709> about<00:03:26.970> 13<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> 15<00:03:28.420> pounds<00:03:30.389> getting<00:03:31.389> back<00:03:31.510> to

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
at about 13 to 15 pounds getting back to

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.960 
at about 13 to 15 pounds getting back to
the<00:03:31.720> main<00:03:31.810> plate<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.319> see<00:03:32.560> it's<00:03:33.519> actually

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
the main plate you can see it's actually

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.740 
the main plate you can see it's actually
three<00:03:34.329> layers<00:03:35.310> there's<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.709> base<00:03:38.950> layer<00:03:39.250> here

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
three layers there's the base layer here

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.140 
three layers there's the base layer here
four<00:03:40.750> millimeter<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:43.799> next<00:03:44.799> nickel<00:03:45.159> layer<00:03:45.340> four

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
four millimeter a next nickel layer four

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.229 
four millimeter a next nickel layer four
millimeter<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:47.760> finally<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:50.079> gold<00:03:50.349> layer

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
millimeter and finally the gold layer

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.849 
millimeter and finally the gold layer
it's<00:03:52.239> also<00:03:52.480> for<00:03:52.870> milling<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.290> you've<00:03:53.409> got<00:03:53.530> 12

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
it's also for milling so you've got 12

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.550 
it's also for milling so you've got 12
millimeters<00:03:54.519> thick<00:03:54.849> here<00:03:55.269> on<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:56.290> main

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
millimeters thick here on this main

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.360 
millimeters thick here on this main
plate<00:03:58.470> let's<00:03:59.470> get<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> shot<00:03:59.920> of<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.069> full
