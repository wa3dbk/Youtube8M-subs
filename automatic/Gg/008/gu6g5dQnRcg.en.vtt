the<00:01:47.229> cells<00:01:47.500> sense<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:47.979> think<00:01:48.010> it<00:01:48.250> already<00:01:48.369> is

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
the cells sense I think it already is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.210 
the cells sense I think it already is
the<00:01:49.030> biggest<00:01:49.360> game<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.780> all<00:01:50.020> time<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:51.100> in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
the biggest game of all time but in

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.090 
the biggest game of all time but in
terms<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.490> an<00:01:51.610> actual<00:01:51.760> game<00:01:52.119> sense<00:01:53.100> definitely

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
terms of an actual game sense definitely

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.910 
terms of an actual game sense definitely
in<00:01:54.280> size<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.150> density<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.900> definitely<00:01:56.560> or

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
in size and density it definitely or

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.140 
in size and density it definitely or
laura-leigh<00:01:57.310> looks<00:01:57.490> like<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.700> greatest<00:01:57.939> game

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
laura-leigh looks like the greatest game

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.700 
laura-leigh looks like the greatest game
of<00:01:58.180> all<00:01:58.360> time<00:01:58.420> or<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.080> biggest<00:01:59.350> game<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.530> all

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
of all time or the biggest game of all

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.980 
of all time or the biggest game of all
time<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.119> think<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.420> could<00:02:01.540> easily<00:02:01.630> be<00:02:01.900> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
time and I think it could easily be the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.570 
time and I think it could easily be the
greatest<00:02:02.170> game<00:02:02.350> of<00:02:02.380> all<00:02:02.530> time<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.400> if<00:02:03.490> it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
greatest game of all time and if it

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.219 
greatest game of all time and if it
isn't<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.000> certainly<00:02:04.330> up<00:02:04.509> there<00:02:04.540> within<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
isn't it's certainly up there within the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.009 
isn't it's certainly up there within the
top<00:02:05.409> five<00:02:05.439> top<00:02:05.860> 10<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:07.000> game<00:02:07.270> looks<00:02:07.299> like<00:02:07.750> san

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
top five top 10 the game looks like san

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
that at the GTA 5 and it looks like for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.100 
that at the GTA 5 and it looks like for
the<00:02:55.950> majority<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.540> implementing

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the majority of it it is implementing

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
the majority of it it is implementing
this<00:02:58.200> GTA<00:02:58.560> 5<00:02:58.770> see<00:02:59.010> Franklin<00:02:59.430> with<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.670> gun

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
this GTA 5 see Franklin with a gun

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.150 
this GTA 5 see Franklin with a gun
taking<00:03:00.210> up<00:03:00.330> some<00:03:00.450> men<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:01.530> doesn't<00:03:01.860> look<00:03:01.980> as

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
taking up some men it doesn't look as

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.060 
taking up some men it doesn't look as
heavy<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:02.880> much<00:03:03.660> pain<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:03.930> much<00:03:04.590> pain<00:03:04.860> did

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
heavy as as much pain as much pain did

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.770 
heavy as as much pain as much pain did
but<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.340> looks<00:03:05.520> certainly<00:03:05.910> very<00:03:06.150> realistic

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
but it looks certainly very realistic

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.140 
but it looks certainly very realistic
and<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.260> lot<00:03:07.470> closer<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:08.100> max<00:03:08.280> payne<00:03:08.490> 3<00:03:08.520> then<00:03:08.970> it

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
and a lot closer to max payne 3 then it

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.000 
and a lot closer to max payne 3 then it
would<00:03:09.300> be<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.540> say<00:03:09.690> GTA<00:03:10.050> 4<00:03:10.440> which<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.740> great

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
would be to say GTA 4 which is a great

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.680 
would be to say GTA 4 which is a great
thing<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.730> mean<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.300> they<00:03:12.480> kind<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
thing so I mean now that they kind of

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.360 
thing so I mean now that they kind of
sort<00:03:12.930> out<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> shooting<00:03:13.500> mechanics<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.190> game

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
sort out the shooting mechanics the game

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.920 
sort out the shooting mechanics the game
