00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
just gonna flatten that out a little bit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
just gonna flatten that out a little bit
to<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.000> started<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.800> roll<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:07.920> out

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to get it started and then roll it out

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460 
to get it started and then roll it out
nice<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.310> thin<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.840> doesn't<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
nice and thin this doesn't have to be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.000 
nice and thin this doesn't have to be
paper<00:01:10.770> thin<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.800> substance

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
paper thin it can have some substance

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
paper thin it can have some substance
but<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.550> keep<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.940> mind<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> thicker

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but just keep in mind that the thicker

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.400 
but just keep in mind that the thicker
it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.410> longer<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.370> gonna<00:01:17.460> take<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.940> dry

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
it is the longer it's gonna take to dry

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.320 
it is the longer it's gonna take to dry
before<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.740> apply<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.190> your<00:01:20.370> cake<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
before you can apply it to your cake so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
before you can apply it to your cake so
I'm<00:01:21.420> gonna<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:22.190> somewhere<00:01:23.190> between<00:01:23.490> quarter

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I'm gonna go somewhere between quarter

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.160 
I'm gonna go somewhere between quarter
and<00:01:24.120> an<00:01:24.180> eighth<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.480> inch<00:01:24.540> thick<00:01:24.870> I<00:01:24.990> think

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and an eighth of inch thick I think

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
and an eighth of inch thick I think
that's<00:01:25.290> fine<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.220> five<00:01:26.520> petal<00:01:26.850> cutter

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that's fine so just a five petal cutter

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.540 
that's fine so just a five petal cutter
and<00:01:27.600> I'm<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.260> cut<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.710> wiggle

and I'm just going to cut down wiggle
around<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.910> get<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> nice<00:01:30.210> clean<00:01:30.540> cut<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.110> then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
around to get a nice clean cut and then

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.930 
around to get a nice clean cut and then
I<00:01:32.430> release<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.710> put<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.830> into<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.610> flour

put<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> hole<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.650> not<00:01:49.800> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.980> wire<00:01:50.190> this

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
put a hole in I'm not going to wire this

do while it's just cut and soft just go

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.860

ahead and put a little toothpick there

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.450 
ahead and put a little toothpick there
to<00:01:58.110> make<00:01:58.230> a<00:01:58.260> hole<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.010> wire<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.370> go

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
to make a hole so that your wire can go

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
to make a hole so that your wire can go
through<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.730> later<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.150> once<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.140> flower<00:02:01.440> is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
through it later so once your flower is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
here I don't want to use it in my

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.340 
here I don't want to use it in my
container<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.330> get<00:02:57.570> anything<00:02:58.170> in
