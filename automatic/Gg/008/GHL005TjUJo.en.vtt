00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 hello everyone with you daisy about 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 a month ago I received a review of the parcel 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.949
 with sliders from Belozerov Eugene 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.110
 stickers hit me and clean moments 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.239
 when they looked at them electronically 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.330
 as all layouts are unique designs 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.010
 very beautiful when they got it 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:58.739
 food more delighted with print quality 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.050
 but my joy continued long into 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.690
 test time stickers have dissolved from 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.950
 any clear varnish whether it is top or 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.830
 base and did not immediately panic a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.100
 just wrote eugenia explained all 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.619
 the situation turned out to be just that the whole party 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 which I got a puncture on since 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 even from the substrate all the sliders moved away 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.140
 without exposure to water and thatâ€™s definitely not 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.790
 should be normal from this to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.049
 sorry no one is insured 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 that is why the review was delayed 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.649
 so I decided to wait for the second 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.049
 package and only after that 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.719
 verdict 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.119
 so now I will say about normal sliders 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.509
 from Belozerov Eugene they are different 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.530
 species 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.439
 on white and transparent film as well 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.509
 different sizes which is very convenient therefore 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.079
 sliders fit all sizes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.079
 marigold 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.180
 for starters, I'll show you how to use 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.890
 sliders under the usual varnish I will 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.619
 use sliders on white backing 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.020
 they don't shine but not enough 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.540
 pigmented and so for more vivid 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.560
 light i'm still on our white backing 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.900
 i'm pretty short now 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.760
 nails therefore use the smallest 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.860
 slide size all sliders are printed 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.780
 on a continuous film so they need 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 cut exactly the pattern 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.959
 stickers i will be swinging on the wet 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.959
 paper 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.959
 when the substrate is completely wet slide 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.420
 easy to move because 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.140
 slides soak on paper they are in water 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.209
 they have almost no moisture slider 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.790
 This production is very thin 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 therefore, it is necessary to smooth them very 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.540
 neatly 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.459
 avoiding wrinkles in no way for 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.100
 Do not use hard objects. 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.010
 rubber is better for this 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.750
 hooves or flat brush 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.630
 metal pusher or orange 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.650
 the stick can easily damage the slide that 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.900
 Unfortunately, I had a surplus with 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.900
 the tip is cut down with a glass file 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.459
 their data and it is impossible to cover topom 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 with a drying effect as it turned out others 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:38.099
 I do not therefore overlap them with one 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.750
 base layer now using black lacquer 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:45.819
 I paint over all the irregularities that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:55.930
 formed the ring finger making out 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:58.450
 several guitar varnishes add 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:07.629
 asterisks I want to make similarity 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:13.000
 space and only now I cover everything 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:16.299
 nails a layer of drying due to the fact that 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.370
 the slide has a base drying does not spoil them 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.620
 I have such a space design 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.360
 turned out 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.080
 slider from Belozerov and Kenya itself 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.300
 really cool but for use 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.810
 under the usual varnish you need to tinker 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.580
 but under gel polish everything is much better about 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.530
 See this in the next video. 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.110
 if the video was helpful to you 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.630
 put likes to keep track of new ones
