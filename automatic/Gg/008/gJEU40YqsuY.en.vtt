NZXT century 3 fan controller and
temperature<00:00:07.980> readers<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:09.120> century<00:00:09.840> 3<00:00:10.139> is

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
temperature readers so the century 3 is

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.530 
temperature readers so the century 3 is
a<00:00:10.410> follow-up<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.300> unsurprisingly<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
a follow-up to unsurprisingly the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.099 
a follow-up to unsurprisingly the
century<00:00:12.900> 2<00:00:13.110> both<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.839> five<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
century 2 both of which are five and a

quarter external drive bay accessories

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.470 
quarter external drive bay accessories
so<00:00:19.650> they<00:00:19.830> install<00:00:20.220> into<00:00:20.550> external<00:00:21.029> drive<00:00:21.210> bays

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
so they install into external drive bays

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.790 
so they install into external drive bays
you<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.779> not<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.050> able<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> use<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.769> the

parts<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.690> case<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.559> want<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> fan

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
parts of your case if you want the fan

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
parts of your case if you want the fan
to<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.789> controlled<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.960> temperature<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to be controlled by temperature and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
to be controlled by temperature and
thresholds<00:00:56.730> rather<00:00:57.059> than<00:00:57.300> manually<00:00:57.809> by<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
thresholds rather than manually by you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
thresholds rather than manually by you
just<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.039> case<00:00:59.250> example<00:00:59.789> here<00:00:59.940> we've<00:01:00.090> got

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just a use case example here we've got

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
just a use case example here we've got
five<00:01:00.600> fan<00:01:01.230> channels<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> centry<00:01:02.520> three

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
five fan channels on the centry three

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.660 
five fan channels on the centry three
which<00:01:03.660> means<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.409> hook<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.769> five

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
which means we can hook up five

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
which means we can hook up five
different<00:01:05.909> fans<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.200> daisy<00:01:07.500> chain

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
different fans or we can daisy chain

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.910 
different fans or we can daisy chain
fans<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.790> single<00:01:09.330> channels<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.740> give<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
fans two single channels so to give you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.039 
fans two single channels so to give you
an<00:01:11.100> example<00:01:11.400> let's<00:01:11.760> say<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> case

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
an example let's say we have a case

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.350 
an example let's say we have a case
that's<00:01:13.080> got<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.950> two<00:01:14.460> hundred<00:01:14.760> millimeter<00:01:15.090> fan

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that's got a two hundred millimeter fan

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's got a two hundred millimeter fan
a<00:01:15.600> 120<00:01:16.229> millimeter<00:01:16.590> fan<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.159> two<00:01:17.549> 140

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a 120 millimeter fan and two 140

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
a 120 millimeter fan and two 140
millimeter<00:01:18.390> fans<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.530> problem<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
millimeter fans so the problem here is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
millimeter fans so the problem here is
if<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:20.939> using<00:01:21.090> stock<00:01:21.509> fans<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.320> sake

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
if we're using stock fans just for sake

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.490 
if we're using stock fans just for sake
of<00:01:22.650> example<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.970> 120<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> 140<00:01:25.049> millimeter

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of example the 120 and 140 millimeter

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.780 
of example the 120 and 140 millimeter
fans<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.159> significantly

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
fans are going to be significantly

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
fans are going to be significantly
louder<00:01:27.000> than<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> 200<00:01:28.020> plus<00:01:28.140> millimeter<00:01:28.740> fans

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
louder than the 200 plus millimeter fans

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.999 
louder than the 200 plus millimeter fans
and<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.759> matter<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.210> size<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
and that's just a matter of size and

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.420 
and that's just a matter of size and
speed<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.400> rotation<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.960> let's<00:01:34.290> say<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
speed of rotation so let's say that we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.390 
speed of rotation so let's say that we
want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.810> keep<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> 200<00:01:37.590> millimeter<00:01:37.770> fan<00:01:38.189> at

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
want to keep the 200 millimeter fan at

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920 
want to keep the 200 millimeter fan at
max<00:01:38.670> speed<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> quietest

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
max speed because it's the quietest

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.530 
max speed because it's the quietest
anyway<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.380> who<00:01:40.650> cares<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.670> drop<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> speed

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
anyway so who cares but drop the speed

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.230 
anyway so who cares but drop the speed
of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> 120<00:01:43.619> 140<00:01:43.979> s<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:44.909> hook

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of the 120 140 s we can actually hook

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.700 
of the 120 140 s we can actually hook
all<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.869> fans<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> different

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
all of those fans up to different

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.789 
all of those fans up to different
channels<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.780> even<00:01:49.079> link<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
channels and then we can even link the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.740 
channels and then we can even link the
two<00:01:49.979> 140<00:01:50.490> millimeter<00:01:50.820> fans<00:01:51.030> together<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
two 140 millimeter fans together in a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.139 
two 140 millimeter fans together in a
single<00:01:51.990> channel<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.340> drop<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.880> speed

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
single channel so when we drop the speed

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.560 
single channel so when we drop the speed
of<00:01:54.299> them<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.960> will<00:01:55.290> impact<00:01:55.710> both<00:01:56.009> fans

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
of them it will impact both fans

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.230 
of them it will impact both fans
simultaneously<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> decrease<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.340> RPM

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
simultaneously and decrease the RPM

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
simultaneously and decrease the RPM
which<00:02:00.540> decreases<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> noise<00:02:01.590> levels<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
which decreases the noise levels in the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
which decreases the noise levels in the
case<00:02:02.369> hopefully<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.090> match<00:02:03.240> your<00:02:03.540> slower

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
case hopefully to match your slower

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.649 
case hopefully to match your slower
quieter<00:02:04.860> fans<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.450> far

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
quieter fans and this all of this so far

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.510 
quieter fans and this all of this so far
is<00:02:06.689> handled<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> touch<00:02:07.409> input<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
is handled to touch input so you can

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.219 
is handled to touch input so you can
actually<00:02:08.789> link<00:02:09.239> two<00:02:09.690> channels<00:02:10.080> together

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
actually link two channels together

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.660 
actually link two channels together
let's<00:02:10.739> say<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.550> front<00:02:11.879> fans<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.480> rear

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
let's say you have front fans and rear

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.880 
let's say you have front fans and rear
fans<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.120> your<00:02:13.300> case<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.470> link<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
fans on your case so you can link the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.650 
fans on your case so you can link the
front<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.340> rear<00:02:15.490> channels<00:02:16.000> together<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
front and rear channels together and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.890 
front and rear channels together and
then<00:02:17.200> when<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.560> adjust<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.550> dial<00:02:19.540> there

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
then when you adjust the the dial there

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
then when you adjust the the dial there
the<00:02:20.170> dial<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:20.860> touch<00:02:21.040> input<00:02:21.430> when

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the dial is actually touch input when

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.690 
the dial is actually touch input when
you<00:02:21.700> adjust<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.540> 100%<00:02:23.470> or<00:02:23.860> 40%<00:02:24.190> or

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
you adjust that to 100% or 40% or

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.740 
you adjust that to 100% or 40% or
anything<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.120> between

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
anything in between

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.260 
anything in between
it'll<00:02:25.989> change<00:02:26.260> all<00:02:27.069> fans<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> front<00:02:28.209> and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
it'll change all fans in the front and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.330 
it'll change all fans in the front and
rear<00:02:28.330> configuration<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:29.950> kind<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.220> an

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
rear configuration so that's kind of an

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.400 
rear configuration so that's kind of an
example<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.910> how<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.239> device<00:02:31.750> works

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
example of how this device works

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.920 
example of how this device works
it<00:02:32.620> displays<00:02:33.010> temperatures<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.970> Celsius<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it displays temperatures in Celsius and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.320 
it displays temperatures in Celsius and
Fahrenheit<00:02:35.340> unfortunately<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.120> done

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
Fahrenheit unfortunately this is done

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.690 
Fahrenheit unfortunately this is done
using<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.989> temperature<00:02:38.950> probe<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.430> problem

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
using a temperature probe the problem

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.250 
using a temperature probe the problem
with<00:02:39.790> temperature<00:02:40.209> probes<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.780> they<00:02:40.959> can<00:02:41.140> only

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
with temperature probes is they can only

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.259 
with temperature probes is they can only
read<00:02:41.500> external<00:02:42.099> temperatures<00:02:42.550> generally<00:02:43.120> of

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
read external temperatures generally of

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.330 
read external temperatures generally of
things<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.930> heat<00:02:44.050> sink<00:02:44.349> you<00:02:45.010> can't

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
things like the heat sink you can't

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.320 
things like the heat sink you can't
actually<00:02:45.640> read<00:02:46.330> anything<00:02:46.930> useful<00:02:47.620> like

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
actually read anything useful like

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.850 
actually read anything useful like
t-junction<00:02:49.330> on<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> cpu<00:02:49.989> obviously<00:02:50.590> because

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
t-junction on the cpu obviously because

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.400 
t-junction on the cpu obviously because
that<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.250> handled<00:02:51.790> at<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.170> semiconductor<00:02:53.170> level

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that is handled at a semiconductor level

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.380 
that is handled at a semiconductor level
on<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.620> die<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.730> can't<00:02:54.760> even<00:02:55.060> read<00:02:55.209> T

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390

case because it would need to be

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.820

T Junction CPU temperatures which is the

those<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.900> make<00:03:50.079> it<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:51.100> Sentry

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
those and make it so that the Sentry

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.949 
those and make it so that the Sentry
acts<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:53.320> cams<00:03:53.620> readings<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.780> think<00:03:55.780> they

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
acts on the cams readings I think they

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.990 
acts on the cams readings I think they
would<00:03:56.109> have<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.260> seriously<00:03:56.829> good<00:03:56.950> product<00:03:57.819> that

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
would have a seriously good product that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.270 
would have a seriously good product that
I<00:03:58.030> would<00:03:58.269> actually<00:03:58.420> want<00:03:59.230> on<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> functional

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280

if<00:04:24.070> you're<00:04:24.280> looking<00:04:24.640> for<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.849> cool<00:04:25.060> way<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.300> soup

your<00:04:26.350> system<00:04:26.710> after<00:04:26.860> you've<00:04:27.070> already<00:04:27.160> built

your system after you've already built

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.980 
your system after you've already built
it<00:04:27.790> this<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.180> something<00:04:28.480> I<00:04:28.570> would<00:04:28.630> highly

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
it this is something I would highly

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.440 
it this is something I would highly
recommend<00:04:29.410> unlike<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.310> Sentry<00:04:30.640> 2<00:04:30.850> this<00:04:31.240> one

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
recommend unlike the Sentry 2 this one

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.750 
recommend unlike the Sentry 2 this one
has<00:04:31.600> very<00:04:31.780> few<00:04:32.110> fan<00:04:32.560> cables<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.190> they're<00:04:33.640> all

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
has very few fan cables and they're all

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.820 
has very few fan cables and they're all
modular<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.450> you<00:04:34.480> can<00:04:34.660> unplug<00:04:34.870> any<00:04:35.200> cables<00:04:35.680> or

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
modular so you can unplug any cables or

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.090 
modular so you can unplug any cables or
channel<00:04:36.220> cables<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.700> you're<00:04:36.820> not<00:04:36.970> using<00:04:37.210> and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
channel cables that you're not using and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.770 
channel cables that you're not using and
that<00:04:39.100> just<00:04:39.490> means<00:04:39.760> less<00:04:40.180> clutter<00:04:40.480> in<00:04:40.660> your

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
that just means less clutter in your

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.350 
that just means less clutter in your
case<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.410> good<00:04:42.010> news<00:04:42.220> all<00:04:42.460> around<00:04:42.490> that's<00:04:43.150> what
