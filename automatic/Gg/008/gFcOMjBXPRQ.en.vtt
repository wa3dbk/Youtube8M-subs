happened<00:00:24.900> between<00:00:25.109> Windows<00:00:25.920> 8<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.400> Windows

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
happened between Windows 8 and Windows

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.960 
happened between Windows 8 and Windows
8.1<00:00:27.800> well<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.310> actually<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.730> new

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
8.1 well there was actually a new

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.490 
8.1 well there was actually a new
feature<00:00:30.359> put<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.230> called<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:33.050> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.230> font

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
feature put in called a kind of font

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.310 
feature put in called a kind of font
smoothing<00:00:35.270> dpi<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.430> um<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.270> font<00:00:39.719> scaling

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
smoothing dpi so um and or font scaling

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.110 
smoothing dpi so um and or font scaling
or<00:00:40.530> display<00:00:40.920> scaling<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.670> something<00:00:42.000> like

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
or display scaling or something like

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.369 
or display scaling or something like
that<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.140> application<00:00:43.770> itself<00:00:44.040> has<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.550> be

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
that so the application itself has to be

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.940 
that so the application itself has to be
dpi<00:00:46.379> aware<00:00:47.750> but<00:00:48.750> nevertheless<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.469> looks<00:00:49.770> like

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
dpi aware but nevertheless it looks like

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.880 
dpi aware but nevertheless it looks like
crap<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.539> terrible<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
crap and it's terrible just because it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.610 
crap and it's terrible just because it
looks<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.219> bit<00:00:53.460> fuzzy<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.530> even<00:00:55.530> though

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
looks a little bit fuzzy and even though

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
looks a little bit fuzzy and even though
it's<00:00:55.770> trying<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> smooth<00:00:56.340> things<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.910> how

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it's trying to smooth things out so how

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's trying to smooth things out so how
do<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> fix<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.620> if<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.039> close<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.789> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
do you fix this so if you close out of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.439 
do you fix this so if you close out of
your<00:01:00.600> programs<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.640> Google<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> way

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
your programs that was Google by the way

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.130 
your programs that was Google by the way
so<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.799> executable<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.140> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
so I know the executable here is in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.219
