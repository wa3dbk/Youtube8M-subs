00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.050
 2 hours 46 minutes during the afternoon 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.050
 Welcome to that moment 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.190
 Huge earthquake with a maximum seismic intensity of 7 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:33.490
 It is a figure of a pedestrian squatting down to much shaking 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.960
 About one hour before 4:00 pm 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:40.110
 It was when the car stopped in a traffic jam 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 From the left of the screen 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.410
 What number cars flowed into tsunami 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.579
 From now on self-proclaimed today 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.960
 Now O'surging tsunami from behind 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:08.070
 Only 10 seconds No. tsunami in the car has reached 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.070
 Mr. Muroga's car begins to be pushed forward gradually 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 And after 25 seconds the car is completely lifted 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.880
 I lose control and begin to drift 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.880
 At this time, Mr. Muroka was still staying in-house 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.890
 Mr. Muroga's car is only in the black wagon ahead 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.980
 There are men in the crowd 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.980
 eh 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.460
 Hmm 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.080
 I thought about running away right after this collision 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.950
 That the window was opened 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.950
 a rosso me Bailly 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:08.070
 The debris in front of the screen and the car slowly flow to the right while the screen country is awesome 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.070
 The track is swept to the left at speed 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.840
 Good man in a crashed wagon 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.450
 I also see evacuation on the car 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.340
 If not 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.650
 By the apple 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.159
 And slowly the car to change the orientation 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.780
 Then the camera rushes from between the buildings 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.780
 It captures the intense flow 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.540
 The broadcast which tells the damage of the tsunami which happened in another place in the full horse 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.610
 Can not be 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.730
 I have been working on 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.690
 At this time, Mr. Muroga said that he had been thinking if he would escape five cars at his company 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460
 Our commitment 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.900
 And about 4 minutes after beginning to be washed away 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.420
 As cars are drawn 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.420
 I was caught in a fast flowing stream 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 Hmm 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.810
 Fluma shaken up and down a lot 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.049
 Another car was in front of me 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.049
 The 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.740
 The car that started to rotate is still carrying blogger 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.740
 Sand minnie keeps flowing 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.550
 I sleep 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.550
 Have 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.250
 And 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.250
 Approximately four and a half minutes from the tsunami encounter 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.250
 Especially 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.220
 Where a car collides with a building and sinks into the water 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.220
 The picture was broken
