00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
biodegradable when they wash your way

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.100 
biodegradable when they wash your way
down<00:04:40.260> your<00:04:40.470> shower<00:04:40.850> or<00:04:41.850> down<00:04:42.389> your<00:04:42.539> sink<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
down your shower or down your sink and

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.779 
down your shower or down your sink and
it's<00:04:43.289> bad<00:04:43.530> for<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.800> environment<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.340> someone

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
it's bad for the environment so someone

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:45.830 
it's bad for the environment so someone
said<00:04:44.940> it<00:04:45.030> might<00:04:45.180> have<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.449> do<00:04:45.570> with<00:04:45.600> those

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
said it might have to do with those

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.260 
said it might have to do with those
regulations<00:04:46.350> but<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.860> thought<00:04:47.130> if<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.669> was<00:04:48.060> it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
regulations but I thought if that was it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.270 
regulations but I thought if that was it
why<00:04:48.840> not<00:04:49.050> just<00:04:49.199> say<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.620> why<00:04:49.800> did<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:49.979> say

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
why not just say that why did you say

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.219 
why not just say that why did you say

due to environmental regulations we've
had<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.500> change<00:04:52.530> our<00:04:52.889> formula<00:04:53.340> we<00:04:53.820> hope<00:04:53.970> you

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
had to change our formula we hope you

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.490 
had to change our formula we hope you
like<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.360> new<00:04:54.479> formula<00:04:54.840> instead<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:55.289> same

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500
