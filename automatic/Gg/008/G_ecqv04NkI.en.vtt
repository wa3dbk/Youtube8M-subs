out

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.130 

so<00:00:24.460> Matt<00:00:24.610> as<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.850> swimmer<00:00:25.360> how<00:00:25.840> does<00:00:26.020> this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
so Matt as a swimmer how does this

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.280 
so Matt as a swimmer how does this
compare<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.620> a<00:00:26.830> lap<00:00:27.130> I<00:00:27.779> would<00:00:28.779> say<00:00:28.960> it's<00:00:29.110> very

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
compare to a lap I would say it's very

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.800 
compare to a lap I would say it's very
similar

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
similar

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.360 

I<00:00:31.869> think<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.230> one<00:00:32.380> big<00:00:32.559> adjustment<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.190> just

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
I think the one big adjustment is just

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.520 
I think the one big adjustment is just
having<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.850> current<00:00:34.120> in<00:00:34.329> your<00:00:34.360> face<00:00:34.690> but<00:00:35.170> it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
having the current in your face but it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
having the current in your face but it
took<00:00:35.680> me

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
took me

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.680 
took me
only<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> couple<00:00:36.929> seconds<00:00:37.379> to<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.649> adjusted

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
only a couple seconds to get adjusted

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.020 
only a couple seconds to get adjusted
I<00:00:38.719> think

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
I think

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.029 
I think
you<00:00:41.090> can<00:00:41.239> keep<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.600> same<00:00:41.840> stroke<00:00:42.140> great<00:00:42.379> it's

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
you can keep that same stroke great it's

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.910 
you can keep that same stroke great it's
always<00:00:43.340> constant<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.809> is<00:00:44.899> very<00:00:45.110> similar

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
always constant so it is very similar

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.079 
always constant so it is very similar
I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.399> big<00:00:47.550> difference<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
I think the big difference is just

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.220 
I think the big difference is just
having<00:00:48.449> Perry<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.929> your<00:00:49.050> face

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
having Perry in your face

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.960 
having Perry in your face
how<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:50.920> think<00:00:51.040> someone<00:00:51.340> who<00:00:51.460> isn't<00:00:51.880> a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
how do you think someone who isn't a

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.420 
how do you think someone who isn't a
swimmer<00:00:52.300> would<00:00:52.770> fare<00:00:53.770> in<00:00:53.950> something<00:00:54.280> like

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
swimmer would fare in something like

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.220 
swimmer would fare in something like
this<00:00:54.580> is<00:00:54.790> it<00:00:54.880> easily<00:00:55.270> adjustable<00:00:55.750> for<00:00:56.020> someone

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
this is it easily adjustable for someone

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.980 
this is it easily adjustable for someone
who<00:00:56.320> isn't<00:00:56.470> strong<00:00:56.950> it<00:00:57.730> has<00:00:57.810> settings<00:00:58.810> for

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
who isn't strong it has settings for

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.020 
who isn't strong it has settings for
most<00:00:59.230> novice<00:00:59.650> summer<00:00:59.980> all<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.670> way<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:00.790> your

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
most novice summer all the way to your

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.910 
most novice summer all the way to your
most<00:01:01.210> advanced<00:01:01.540> swimmer<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.560> it's<00:01:02.710> just<00:01:02.800> a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
most advanced swimmer so it's just a

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.799 
most advanced swimmer so it's just a
matter<00:01:02.950> of<00:01:03.190> finding<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:03.730> but<00:01:04.000> I<00:01:04.239> think<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.660> a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
matter of finding it but I think it a

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.750 
matter of finding it but I think it a
can<00:01:04.960> accommodate<00:01:05.500> any<00:01:05.590> kind<00:01:05.860> whether<00:01:06.550> you're

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
can accommodate any kind whether you're

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
can accommodate any kind whether you're
a<00:01:06.790> starter<00:01:07.270> or

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
