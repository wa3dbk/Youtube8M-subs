let's see if we manage to beat him by

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.510 
let's see if we manage to beat him by
Rick<00:03:05.430> averse<00:03:05.730> they<00:03:06.090> would<00:03:06.270> go<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:10.500> yeah<00:03:11.340> we

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
Rick averse they would go and yeah we

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:29.539 
Rick averse they would go and yeah we
did<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.990> with<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.020> faded<00:03:13.560> were<00:03:14.130> gone

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.940 

so<00:03:30.549> yeah<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.030> once<00:03:31.239> again<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.870> gain<00:03:32.079> more<00:03:32.530> HP

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
so yeah and once again we gain more HP

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.770 
so yeah and once again we gain more HP
so<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.909> guess<00:03:34.719> we'll<00:03:35.170> always<00:03:35.680> get<00:03:36.129> more<00:03:36.849> HP<00:03:37.060> from

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
so I guess we'll always get more HP from

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.020 
so I guess we'll always get more HP from
those<00:03:38.049> secret<00:03:38.530> portals<00:03:38.950> will<00:03:39.639> see<00:03:39.939> you<00:03:40.000> guys
