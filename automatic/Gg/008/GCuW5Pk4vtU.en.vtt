one thing I'm not straight away from
looking<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> lot

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
looking at is I think it looks a lot

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.720 
looking at is I think it looks a lot
bigger<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> photos<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
bigger than the photos I know if you and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.610 
bigger than the photos I know if you and
watch<00:00:51.000> YouTube<00:00:51.480> review<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:52.020> google<00:00:52.350> images

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
watch YouTube review or google images

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
watch YouTube review or google images
you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> size<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.030> think

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you can see the size of it but I think

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
you can see the size of it but I think
from<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.649> selling

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
from the way they kind of on selling

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
from the way they kind of on selling
websites<00:00:56.640> almost<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> size<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
websites almost it's like the size of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
websites almost it's like the size of
just<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> bit<00:00:58.440> bigger<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.859> golf<00:00:59.010> ball<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
just a bit bigger than a golf ball is

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.470 
just a bit bigger than a golf ball is
this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.090> bigger<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this is kind of a bit bigger than a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
this is kind of a bit bigger than a
cricket<00:01:00.750> ball<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.170> hopefully<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.129> should<00:01:02.250> have

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
cricket ball so hopefully it should have

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740
