can<00:00:06.729> you<00:00:06.910> define<00:00:07.450> for<00:00:08.019> us<00:00:08.230> what<00:00:08.920> is<00:00:09.219> holistic

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
can you define for us what is holistic

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.410 
can you define for us what is holistic
review<00:00:10.590> what<00:00:11.590> does<00:00:11.740> it<00:00:11.889> mean<00:00:12.160> to<00:00:12.459> a<00:00:12.910> medical

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
review what does it mean to a medical

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.060 
review what does it mean to a medical
school<00:00:13.450> into<00:00:14.020> a<00:00:14.049> medical<00:00:14.469> school<00:00:14.559> admissions

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
school into a medical school admissions

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.210 
school into a medical school admissions
committee<00:00:15.430> and<00:00:15.760> why<00:00:16.600> should<00:00:17.230> a<00:00:17.260> student<00:00:18.070> who's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
committee and why should a student who's

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.640 
committee and why should a student who's
applying<00:00:18.520> to<00:00:18.730> medical<00:00:18.880> school<00:00:19.650> understand

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
applying to medical school understand

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.320 
applying to medical school understand
what<00:00:21.160> it<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:22.080> that's<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.200> lot<00:00:23.670> many<00:00:24.670> fastening<00:00:25.300> a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
what it is that's a lot many fastening a

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.800 
what it is that's a lot many fastening a
lot<00:00:25.510> so<00:00:26.140> first<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.590> think<00:00:26.850> probably<00:00:27.850> be<00:00:28.420> honest

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
lot so first I think probably be honest

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.310 
lot so first I think probably be honest
maybe<00:00:29.320> holistic<00:00:29.949> met<00:00:30.690> review<00:00:31.690> needs<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:32.050> little

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
maybe holistic met review needs a little

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.529 
maybe holistic met review needs a little
different<00:00:32.770> things<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.579> different<00:00:33.730> schools<00:00:34.120> so

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
different things to different schools so

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.540 
different things to different schools so
I'll<00:00:34.660> kind<00:00:35.379> of<00:00:35.469> couch<00:00:35.680> it<00:00:35.890> in<00:00:36.010> terms<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.399> what

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
I'll kind of couch it in terms of what

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.510 
I'll kind of couch it in terms of what
it<00:00:36.640> means<00:00:36.820> to<00:00:37.030> my<00:00:37.600> particular<00:00:38.520> institution

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
it means to my particular institution

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.850 
it means to my particular institution
and<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.239> think<00:00:40.329> it<00:00:40.930> kind<00:00:41.200> of<00:00:41.230> goes<00:00:41.320> back<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:41.739> this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
and I think it kind of goes back to this

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.260 
and I think it kind of goes back to this
idea<00:00:42.040> that<00:00:42.250> we've<00:00:42.430> talked<00:00:42.670> about<00:00:42.910> about

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
idea that we've talked about about

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.220 
idea that we've talked about about
diversity<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.050> that<00:00:44.980> there<00:00:45.160> are<00:00:45.309> different

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
diversity and that there are different

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.569 
diversity and that there are different
pathways<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:48.250> medicine<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:49.890> folks<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:51.430> come

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
pathways to medicine and folks that come

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.889 
pathways to medicine and folks that come
to<00:00:51.730> medicine<00:00:52.149> come<00:00:52.390> from<00:00:52.630> different

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
to medicine come from different

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.770 
to medicine come from different
backgrounds<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:54.820> there<00:00:55.120> is<00:00:55.239> probably

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
backgrounds and that there is probably

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.049 
backgrounds and that there is probably
not<00:00:56.079> one<00:00:56.500> single<00:00:57.219> set<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:57.879> attributes<00:00:58.870> or

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
not one single set of attributes or

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.170 
not one single set of attributes or
indicators<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:02.010> apply<00:01:03.010> equally<00:01:03.579> well<00:01:03.879> to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
indicators that apply equally well to

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.660 
indicators that apply equally well to
every<00:01:04.899> candidate<00:01:05.469> and<00:01:05.799> so<00:01:06.430> there<00:01:06.610> are

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
every candidate and so there are

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.459 
every candidate and so there are
certainly<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.539> idea<00:01:07.869> in<00:01:07.930> holistic<00:01:08.229> medicine

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
certainly the idea in holistic medicine

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.740 
certainly the idea in holistic medicine
is<00:01:09.070> given<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.909> fact<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.630> know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
is given the fact that you know

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.570 
is given the fact that you know
certainly<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.229> student<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.100> applicant<00:01:12.490> needs

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
certainly a student and applicant needs

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.240 
certainly a student and applicant needs
to<00:01:12.729> be<00:01:12.820> academically<00:01:13.330> qualified<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.770> beyond

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
to be academically qualified but beyond

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.130 
to be academically qualified but beyond
that<00:01:15.400> as<00:01:15.820> we've<00:01:16.000> talked<00:01:16.270> about<00:01:16.479> there's<00:01:16.659> many

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
that as we've talked about there's many

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.310 
that as we've talked about there's many
many<00:01:17.320> many<00:01:17.560> other<00:01:18.720> facets<00:01:19.720> very<00:01:19.930> many<00:01:20.140> other

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
many many other facets very many other

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.020 
many many other facets very many other
things<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.710> are<00:01:21.040> important<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.580> being

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
things that are important in being

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.510 
things that are important in being
admitted<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.420> medical<00:01:22.689> school<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.830> so<00:01:24.400> the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
admitted to medical school and so the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.990 
admitted to medical school and so the
idea<00:01:24.580> there<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.150> not<00:01:25.390> put<00:01:25.689> a<00:01:26.610> formula<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.640> it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
idea there is to not put a formula to it

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.380 
idea there is to not put a formula to it
but<00:01:28.780> rather<00:01:29.080> as<00:01:29.500> best<00:01:30.010> as<00:01:30.250> possible<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:31.000> take

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
but rather as best as possible to take

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.840 
but rather as best as possible to take
every<00:01:32.170> applicant<00:01:32.799> look<00:01:33.580> at<00:01:33.760> as<00:01:33.970> many<00:01:35.850> criteria

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
every applicant look at as many criteria

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.179 
every applicant look at as many criteria
as<00:01:37.799> possible<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.479> kind<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.229> assess

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
as possible and it to kind of assess

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.109 
as possible and it to kind of assess
that<00:01:42.460> application<00:01:43.830> almost<00:01:44.830> individually<00:01:45.400> on

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
that application almost individually on

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.899 
that application almost individually on
its<00:01:46.150> own<00:01:46.509> merit<00:01:47.460> rather<00:01:48.460> than<00:01:48.820> trying<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:50.909> root

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
its own merit rather than trying to root

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.730 
its own merit rather than trying to root
I<00:01:52.329> guess<00:01:52.509> or<00:01:53.970> put<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.060> up<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.360> some<00:01:55.740> Predis

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
I guess or put it up to some Predis

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.920 
I guess or put it up to some Predis
conceived<00:01:57.310> standard<00:01:58.030> as<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.720> what<00:01:58.900> a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
conceived standard as to this is what a

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.410 
conceived standard as to this is what a
medical<00:01:59.409> student<00:01:59.590> should<00:02:00.400> look<00:02:00.610> like<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.030> I

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
medical student should look like and I

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.480 
medical student should look like and I
think<00:02:01.659> one<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.020> things<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.350> comes<00:02:03.070> into<00:02:03.280> that

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
think one of things that comes into that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.510 
think one of things that comes into that
is<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:04.149> is<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.750> goal<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.320> increasing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
is this is the goal of increasing

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.850 
is this is the goal of increasing
diversity<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.689> think<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.079> students<00:02:08.649> that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
diversity and I think the students that

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.919 
diversity and I think the students that
are<00:02:09.179> disadvantaged<00:02:10.179> economically

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
are disadvantaged economically

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.250 
are disadvantaged economically
culturally<00:02:11.680> ethnically<00:02:12.670> whatever<00:02:13.180> often<00:02:14.109> are

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
culturally ethnically whatever often are

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.720 
culturally ethnically whatever often are
those<00:02:14.439> students<00:02:14.889> that<00:02:15.040> come<00:02:15.279> from<00:02:15.579> a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
those students that come from a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.590 
those students that come from a
different<00:02:16.090> pathway<00:02:16.359> or<00:02:16.959> with<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.799> different

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
different pathway or with a different

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.080 
different pathway or with a different
background<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.550> certainly<00:02:20.550> from<00:02:20.700> our<00:02:20.910> point

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
background and certainly from our point

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.700 
background and certainly from our point
of<00:02:21.210> view<00:02:21.270> one<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.810> our<00:02:21.930> institutional<00:02:22.530> goals

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
of view one of our institutional goals

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.510 
of view one of our institutional goals
is<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.440> achieve<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.800> diversity<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.430> our

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
is to is to achieve a diversity in our

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.250 
is to is to achieve a diversity in our
student<00:02:26.940> body<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.740> way<00:02:29.040> to
