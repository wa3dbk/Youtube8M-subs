00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.690
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.070
 online magazine of civil radio 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.809
 radio che and in ru 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.789
 this will lead rabotka station 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.050
 megajet mj-555 stations from the new batch 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 the circuit is technically nothing here 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:28.210
 changed but the culture of production 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.340
 Chinese workers increased markedly by 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.429
 at least with respect to such here 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.909
 the unit continues to be a process 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.710
 works we will remove the lid guna 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:41.589
 little has changed now she 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.019
 Looks like this for the rest 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:49.899
 looks very decent no flux traces 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.459
 no problem of the quality curve 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.440
 there is no soldering 

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:55.809
 a place where something came after 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.379
 automatic assembly but apparently so 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:05.410
 and there must be another side too 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.470
 pretty neat course over some 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.420
 in some places you can work but in general 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.510
 the station produces a very nice 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.570
 impression like excalibur ii turbo 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.030
 latest releases we are gadgets 150 and 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 also seems to be a little bit of quality 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 pulled up 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.140
 so now let's hear how 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.840
 radio station is on air 12 channel 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:38.610
 fm12 channel two times three three times two three 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 ale 123 founder ale ale ale ale 12 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:49.659
 ringing modulation symbol approximately 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.659
 Today, the barbarians interpret listen 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.060
 bags 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.159
 ale-ale times two three times two three 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.600
 olya 66 its am6 water my mother fear 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.930
 little verteb 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.850
 of the temple there is a straight eager 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.670
 so to be continued first 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.310
 we fix all the flaws in the assembly 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:28.310
 bitten off the wires are soldered carefully 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.900
 connector central wasp I put the connector 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 for quick disconnection to the cable 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.810
 Power now radio station can be quickly 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.019
 disconnect 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.750
 if necessary the next item is 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.230
 modulation refinement we need this one 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.690
 capacitor remove this one here 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.660
 the capacitor we plug into place 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.480
 remote 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.500
 here we replace this capacitor by 2 and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.120
 2 nano farad 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.310
 and here we replace this capacitor by 22 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.570
 on on farad 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.820
 we also need this capacitor 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.829
 electrolytic remove but this one 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.019
 solder to a remote location 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.970
 to be continued 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.950
 modulation before work on all operations 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.239
 implemented now we need to install 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.750
 hysteresis to threshold squelch 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.579
 adjust hysteresis 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.600
 automatic noise suppressor check 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.340
 its setting and continuation follows i 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.660
 added hysteresis to threshold 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.250
 squelch corrected 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.900
 automatic hysteresis 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.120
 squelch now let's check 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:35.090
 we are looking at his setup 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.870
 going on the 12 legs of the receiver here at 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.680
 us 115 112 113 volts is the norm 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.639
 automatic squelch now 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.480
 should work correctly and last 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.489
 hatch 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.489
 this eliminates clicks when working 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.129
 squelch hey for that we need 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.110
 make some manipulations here with 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.659
 this section of the scheme should be continued 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.610
 click problem fixed for this 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.730
 between these two legs we shall give drink 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.849
 condenser one microfarad and cut 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.180
 here we put this track resistor 10 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.099
 kilowatt well that refinement is almost 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.299
 finished now you can collect station 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.880
 and check how it sounds on the air 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.169
 continuation follows work practically 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.550
 completed now our station has 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:30.350
 hysteresis a couple times the squelch and here 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:33.289
 here it is clearly visible pen appeared 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.270
 free running automatic 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:42.020
 noise suppressor 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:46.280
 also works now let's listen 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:57.950
 how the radio station is on the air m 12 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:05:03.320
 channel is louder one two three times two three 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:07.430
 one two three times two three seven brother forces 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:21.110
 that's all that's loud ringing beautiful 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:24.110
 modulation ol 1 231 be quiet ale-ale time 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.560

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.510
 alev alev 123 is also very loudly loud 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.650
 natural nice beautiful voice 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:38.010
 Salim Ala 6 and here is his 6 your good 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.050
 ringing beautiful modulation that refinement 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.090
 finished now you can pack 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.930
 do not send the station to the box 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.740
 Thank you all the best to the customer 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.740
