00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.379
 never exactly had we planned the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.910
 visit of a pulmonologist who heard us 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.650
 talk about the risk of sleeping in one of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.799
 the feather pillows we tell 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.150
 yesterday but had a health problem 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 so we'll leave it for more 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 go ahead but today doctor josÃ© visited us 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.279
 luis manrique he is a naturopathic doctor and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.410
 biologist will now explain to us that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.210
 will teach you to live a menopause without 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.949
 drastic hormonal changes if you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 they ask why did you get that marta topic 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.640
 it's because I'm already feeling that the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.640
 Menopause touches my door 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.000
 on the contrary friend that I am the most 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:48.149
 close to that period not then is this 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.820
 still in the Mexican woman 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.840
 assumes that menopause starts between 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.060
 the period of 45 and 55 years there is but 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.180
 everything has changed as well as tran 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.760
 climate change traffic I will 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.729
 I would recommend to women that they 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.250
 will begin to take care of the 35 years 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.800
 hormonal issue because there is a 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.200
 area that is called perimenopause or 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.140
 everything that happens around the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.860
 menopause and you start with disorders of the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.430
 dream and you start with clean tics with 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.640
 sweating with headaches starts a 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.250
 tomito medicine mistake because 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.100
 maybe they are with a disorder of the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.940
 Perimenopause is a hormonal disorder 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.369
 and the only way to define the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.520
 diagnosis is to do a study that 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.030
 flame hormonal profile is simple is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.210
 cheap and is very express active for the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.690
 doctor and once you are diagnosed 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.780
 you have early menopause and 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.300
 be careful because if you're feeling 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.190
 right now when she has menopause 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 no ballasting Dvorak 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.590
 and they beat her husband they beat her two 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.470
 children are angry at all nobody the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.710
 understands but men have the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.160
 obligation to understand that stage of the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.160
 woman 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.200
 they divorced him after 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.630
 twenty years of marriage because the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.030
 lady they could not stand and we all have a 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.870
 well known today they were immensely 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.620
 happy and now that they were 40 years old or 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.510
 35 of married are divorcing and have 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.210
 to see surely that period and have 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.830
 that see that period then as everything 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.480
 in life marta you have to do 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.160
 Something for you, do not leave everything to the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.720
 doctors but talk about taking care of yourself doctor 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.210
 how can they be cared for from the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.630
 Ajuntament constantly notice from 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.240
 since I was 35 years old I would tell them to start 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.480
 to take care of your hormonal issue as without 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.270
 having to intoxicate or char is enzo 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.060
 I call myself with food a 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.280
 healthy food I give them food that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.650
 could improve the hormonal issue 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.610
 about estrogen 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.700
 there is a vegetable called aubergine 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.150
 that eggplant provide many estrogens 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 natural to the woman the potato the potato 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.280
 brings many natural estrogens to the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.159
 woman but I want to tell you that the best 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.379
 part of the estrogen in the potato is 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.629
 they find in the shell that is what 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.810
 first that takes away mother to peel 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.840
 you have to let it wash well and for 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.569
 example a stew of potato husks 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.569
 with rajas poblanas is a delicacy of the king 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.260
 and up with estrogen and these 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.200
 favoring your body the oils 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.599
 Mediterranean oils have arrived 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.030
 because women already take longer in 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.980
 have menopause and it is the oil of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.470
 grape seed you can only search in 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.049
 arganda are already the big stores of 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.939
 over a scoop on the 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.239
 grape nugget what they use is the shell 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.500
 of the grape now that oil and that tea 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.660
 help 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.860
 When you will come the least pause 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.430
 you get so strong or go unnoticed 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.190
 the extra virgin olive oil also 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.470
 helps a tablespoon a day and not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.520
 they will raise cholesterol because it is 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.410
 extra virgin there is another oil also that 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.060
 comes from the Mediterranean 'which is called 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.050
 Primrose oil can also 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.660
 get in the tribe the primrose and ss 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.630
 comes in homeopathic presentation 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.000
 sold in stores are either liver or 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.830
 the healthy food stores that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.520
 we all know out there in the big 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:49.030
 squares and they are usually 50 drops of 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.590
 cowslip oil three times a day 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.130
 let's say these are treatments 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.870
 simple homoeopathic and naturopathic 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.700
 but when they are already in the minor and 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.010
 when they are completely in the 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.030
 menopause have to do the profile 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.640
 hormone to see the severity and then 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.420
 but the gravity that does not give us all and 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.420
 nobody is saved 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.260
 and they find out so they had the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.139
 menopause and what a wonder of fact 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.570
 our indigenous races were not known 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.669
 this term of menopause came 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.610
 the average life of women more 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.360
 long lived in the times of our 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.820
 indigenous was 64 years old 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.710
 they died without knowing that it was the 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.460
 menopause and they were still maintained 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.250
 young the skin is bronzed skin 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.010
 brunette helps to help our race 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.410
 indigenous who looked much younger and 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.280
 he died young and not so young he had already 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.800
 64 years it looked like 25 then 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.229
 It was fabulous and in the same man 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.669
 begin to decrease hormones and 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.860
 start to stay with the chickens and 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.080
 I also want to divorce and I'm looking for 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.740
 another couple because he needs to 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.830

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.460

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.310
