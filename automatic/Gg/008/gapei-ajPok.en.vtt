00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
so everybody wants to know what's wrong

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.980 
so everybody wants to know what's wrong
with<00:00:11.730> cooked<00:00:12.300> foods<00:00:13.639> why<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:15.269> cooked<00:00:15.690> foods

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
with cooked foods why are cooked foods

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.170 
with cooked foods why are cooked foods
bad<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.740> think<00:00:17.010> most<00:00:17.310> people<00:00:17.609> would<00:00:17.699> agree<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
bad I think most people would agree that

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.570 
bad I think most people would agree that
natural<00:00:19.020> raw<00:00:19.289> fruits<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.830> vegetables<00:00:20.400> are

natural raw fruits and vegetables are

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.099 
natural raw fruits and vegetables are

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
very few people that would say that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.500 
very few people that would say that
fruits<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.000> vegetables<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.660> bad<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:26.970> most

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
fruits and vegetables are bad but most

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.120 
fruits and vegetables are bad but most
people<00:00:27.779> want<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:27.990> why<00:00:28.349> can't<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.920> eat

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
people want to know why can't I eat

people want to know why can't I eat
cooked<00:00:29.460> foods<00:00:29.699> what's<00:00:30.029> wrong<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.990> well

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
cooked foods what's wrong with them well

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.569 
cooked foods what's wrong with them well
there's<00:00:32.730> there's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.420> huge<00:00:33.719> discussion<00:00:34.320> about

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
there's there's a huge discussion about

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.850 
there's there's a huge discussion about
cook<00:00:35.579> foods<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.270> happens<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.960> them<00:00:37.170> when

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
cook foods and what happens to them when

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.690 
cook foods and what happens to them when
they're<00:00:38.070> cooked<00:00:38.719> when<00:00:40.040> pig<00:00:41.040> farmers<00:00:41.489> gave

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
they're cooked when pig farmers gave

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.950 
they're cooked when pig farmers gave
pigs<00:00:42.120> raw<00:00:42.899> rotten<00:00:43.590> potatoes<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:45.719> pigs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
pigs raw rotten potatoes the pigs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
pigs raw rotten potatoes the pigs
wouldn't<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.500> fat<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.579> had

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
wouldn't get as fat as if they had

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180 
wouldn't get as fat as if they had
didn't<00:00:48.090> cook<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.570> first<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> cook

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
didn't cook them first when you cook

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.790 
didn't cook them first when you cook
something<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.910> breaks<00:00:51.480> down<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.379> molecular

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
something it breaks down the molecular

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.090 
something it breaks down the molecular
bonds<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.180> body<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:55.140> absorb<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.829> or

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
bonds so your body can absorb them or

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.630 
bonds so your body can absorb them or
break<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:56.579> easier<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.520> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
break them down easier so I think it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.920 
break them down easier so I think it's
pretty<00:00:59.879> simple<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> cook

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
pretty simple that when you cook

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.520 
pretty simple that when you cook
something<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.879> allow<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.690> body<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> absorb

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
something you allow your body to absorb

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.880 
something you allow your body to absorb
the<00:01:04.710> calories<00:01:05.630> more<00:01:06.630> easily<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.740> people

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the calories more easily so some people

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
the calories more easily so some people
would<00:01:08.130> say<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.490> isn't<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:09.659> thing

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
would say well isn't that a good thing

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
would say well isn't that a good thing
wouldn't<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.530> better<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.220> able<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> work

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
wouldn't it be better to be able to work

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
wouldn't it be better to be able to work
less<00:01:12.270> hard<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:14.280> breaking<00:01:14.850> down<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.600> bonds

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
less hard on breaking down these bonds

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
less hard on breaking down these bonds
of<00:01:16.710> food<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> absorb<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> calories<00:01:18.390> better

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
of food so to absorb the calories better

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
of food so to absorb the calories better
well<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.380> guess<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> were<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.369> situation

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
well I guess if you were in a situation

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
well I guess if you were in a situation
where<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.450> were<00:01:21.540> only<00:01:21.689> given<00:01:22.080> let's<00:01:22.229> say<00:01:22.350> one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
where you were only given let's say one

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.980 
where you were only given let's say one
potato<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> day<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.880> live<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.659> probably

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
potato a day to live on it probably

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.999 
potato a day to live on it probably
would<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> good<00:01:25.320> idea

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
would be a good idea

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.770 
would be a good idea
cook<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> potato<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.390> absorb<00:01:27.570> as

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
cook that potato so you can absorb as

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.149 
cook that potato so you can absorb as
many<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> calories<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.710> possible

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
many of the calories as possible

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
many of the calories as possible
otherwise<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.700> starts<00:01:30.030> death<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> guess

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
otherwise it starts death so I guess

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.230 
otherwise it starts death so I guess
there<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.680> instances<00:01:32.310> where<00:01:32.640> cook<00:01:32.939> foods

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
there are instances where cook foods

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
there are instances where cook foods
probably<00:01:33.600> aren't<00:01:33.900> beneficial<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
probably aren't beneficial in a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
probably aren't beneficial in a
situation<00:01:35.850> where<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> starve

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
situation where you're going to starve

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.880 
situation where you're going to starve
to<00:01:36.869> death<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.740> enough

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to death when you just don't have enough

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
to death when you just don't have enough
food<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> situation<00:01:39.270> where

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
food but if you're in a situation where

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.590 
food but if you're in a situation where
you<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.079> much<00:01:40.350> food<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.890> want<00:01:41.009> as

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
you have as much food as you want as

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
you have as much food as you want as
much<00:01:42.600> food<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.960> desire<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:44.040> much<00:01:44.280> food<00:01:44.460> as

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
much food as you desire as much food as

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
much food as you desire as much food as
you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.729> consume<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> pretty<00:01:46.259> much

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you can consume which is pretty much

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
you can consume which is pretty much
situation<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.250> we're<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.640> living<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.360> an

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
situation that we're all living in in an

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.020 
situation that we're all living in in an
industrialized<00:01:49.170> society<00:01:49.229> when<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> eat<00:01:50.369> food

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
industrialized society when you eat food

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510 
industrialized society when you eat food
that's<00:01:51.240> cooked<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.470> absorbing<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that's cooked you are absorbing all of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
that's cooked you are absorbing all of
these<00:01:53.909> calories<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:54.810> getting<00:01:55.079> fat

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
these calories and you're getting fat

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.039 
these calories and you're getting fat
and<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.219> fat<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.939> causes<00:01:57.509> lots<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and when you get fat it causes lots of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
and when you get fat it causes lots of
problems<00:01:58.110> you've<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.189> too<00:01:59.369> much<00:01:59.549> weight<00:01:59.820> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
problems you've got too much weight so

too<00:02:09.110> much<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:10.360> bad<00:02:11.360> because<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.930> turned<00:02:12.290> all

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
too much is bad because it turned all

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.350 
too much is bad because it turned all
those<00:02:12.680> calories<00:02:13.250> get<00:02:13.400> converted<00:02:13.760> into<00:02:13.910> stored

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
body that is unhealthy so they're going

body that is unhealthy so they're going
to<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.720> cooked<00:02:24.170> carbohydrates<00:02:24.920> all

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
to be just a cooked carbohydrates all

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.410 
to be just a cooked carbohydrates all
day<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.400> your<00:02:25.520> body's<00:02:25.760> going<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:25.970> turn<00:02:26.209> those

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
day and your body's going to turn those

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.960 
day and your body's going to turn those
things<00:02:26.840> into<00:02:27.290> fat<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.890> eventually<00:02:28.819> it's

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
things into fat and eventually it's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.240 
things into fat and eventually it's
going<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.510> poor<00:02:29.780> health<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.620> that's

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
going to get you poor health so that's

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
going to get you poor health so that's

the main thing that happens with cooked
food<00:02:33.440> your<00:02:33.770> body<00:02:33.920> can<00:02:34.160> absorb<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.610> calories

food your body can absorb the calories

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.850 
food your body can absorb the calories
faster<00:02:35.569> but<00:02:35.989> this<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> lot<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.380> other<00:02:36.500> things

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
faster but this is a lot of other things

00:02:36.860 --> 00:03:28.470 
faster but this is a lot of other things
that<00:02:37.040> are<00:02:37.130> negative<00:02:37.580> about<00:02:37.670> cooking<00:02:38.150> food

another thing that happens when you cook

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.170 
another thing that happens when you cook
food<00:03:30.800> is<00:03:31.069> these<00:03:32.030> enzymes<00:03:32.660> are<00:03:33.489> destroyed<00:03:34.489> the

eat if you submit your body can't use
that<00:03:51.980> protein<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.519> just<00:03:52.550> turn<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.269> into<00:03:53.390> your

that protein and just turn it into your

that protein and just turn it into your
own<00:03:53.630> muscle<00:03:54.080> it's<00:03:54.440> got<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.680> break<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.130> down

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
own muscle it's got to break it down

own muscle it's got to break it down
into<00:03:55.430> amino<00:03:55.580> acids<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.269> then<00:03:56.569> it's<00:03:56.690> got<00:03:56.780> to

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
into amino acids and then it's got to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.680 
into amino acids and then it's got to
rebuild<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.500> as<00:03:57.650> your<00:03:57.980> muscle<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:59.209> full

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
rebuild it as your muscle so a full

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.259 
rebuild it as your muscle so a full
complete<00:04:00.140> protein<00:04:00.680> in<00:04:00.920> itself<00:04:01.610> like<00:04:01.880> animal

a<00:04:06.230> lot<00:04:06.380> of<00:04:06.410> work<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.830> effort<00:04:06.920> if<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.760> eat

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
a lot of work and effort if you eat

also<00:04:38.090> when<00:04:38.270> fats<00:04:38.840> are<00:04:39.560> cooked<00:04:40.070> they're

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
also when fats are cooked they're

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.500 
also when fats are cooked they're
rapidly<00:04:41.330> altered<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.080> they<00:04:42.800> become

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
rapidly altered and they become

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.180 
rapidly altered and they become
carcinogenic<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.750> lot<00:04:44.900> of<00:04:44.930> ways<00:04:45.169> they<00:04:46.070> know

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
carcinogenic in a lot of ways they know

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.120 
carcinogenic in a lot of ways they know
that<00:04:46.419> saturated<00:04:47.419> fats<00:04:47.720> or<00:04:47.960> trans<00:04:48.350> fats<00:04:48.740> are

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
that saturated fats or trans fats are

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.250 
that saturated fats or trans fats are
created<00:04:49.669> from<00:04:49.880> heating<00:04:50.330> those<00:04:50.780> things<00:04:51.050> don't

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
created from heating those things don't

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.710 
created from heating those things don't
exist<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:52.190> nature<00:04:52.789> and<00:04:53.000> natural<00:04:53.120> state

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
exist in nature and natural state

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.600 
exist in nature and natural state
they're<00:04:54.200> created<00:04:54.830> from<00:04:54.979> high-temperature

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
they're created from high-temperature

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.600 
they're created from high-temperature
cooking<00:04:55.729> those<00:04:56.539> things<00:04:56.840> are<00:04:57.250> poison<00:04:58.250> for<00:04:58.520> your

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
cooking those things are poison for your

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.000 
cooking those things are poison for your
body<00:04:58.850> so<00:04:59.479> we<00:04:59.720> know<00:04:59.840> that<00:04:59.870> cooking<00:05:00.530> those<00:05:00.710> types

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
body so we know that cooking those types

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.129 
body so we know that cooking those types
of<00:05:01.160> fats<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.760> very<00:05:02.180> bad<00:05:02.479> and<00:05:02.720> very<00:05:02.930> detrimental

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
of fats is very bad and very detrimental

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.010 
of fats is very bad and very detrimental
to<00:05:03.620> your<00:05:03.770> health<00:05:04.150> also<00:05:05.150> when<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.360> cook<00:05:05.630> food

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
to your health also when you cook food

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.390 
to your health also when you cook food
it<00:05:07.010> becomes<00:05:07.400> dehydrated<00:05:08.050> if<00:05:09.050> anytime<00:05:09.979> you

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
it becomes dehydrated if anytime you

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.730 
it becomes dehydrated if anytime you
cook<00:05:10.669> anything<00:05:10.910> you're<00:05:11.630> taking<00:05:12.050> water<00:05:12.350> out<00:05:12.620> of

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
cook anything you're taking water out of

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.610 
cook anything you're taking water out of
it<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.330> think<00:05:14.450> anything<00:05:14.870> with<00:05:15.080> less<00:05:15.320> water

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
it so I think anything with less water

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.400 
it so I think anything with less water
is<00:05:15.950> less<00:05:16.340> healthy<00:05:16.970> water<00:05:17.600> is<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.870> absolute

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
is less healthy water is the absolute

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.020 
is less healthy water is the absolute
most<00:05:18.560> important<00:05:19.070> critical<00:05:19.490> component<00:05:19.970> to

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
most important critical component to

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.650 
most important critical component to
having<00:05:20.750> good<00:05:20.960> health<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.940> if<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.120> cook<00:05:23.389> foods

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
having good health and if you cook foods

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.690 
having good health and if you cook foods
you're<00:05:24.100> dehydrating<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.340> a<00:05:25.370> certain

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
you're dehydrating that to a certain

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.490 
you're dehydrating that to a certain
extent<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.210> lot<00:05:26.600> of<00:05:26.690> vitamins<00:05:27.139> and<00:05:27.289> minerals

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
extent a lot of vitamins and minerals

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.650 
extent a lot of vitamins and minerals
things<00:05:27.979> that<00:05:28.100> your<00:05:28.190> body<00:05:28.340> needs<00:05:28.760> to<00:05:29.210> be

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
things that your body needs to be

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.409 
things that your body needs to be
healthy<00:05:30.169> or<00:05:30.320> destroyed<00:05:31.220> or<00:05:31.520> they're<00:05:32.030> they're

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
healthy or destroyed or they're they're

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.590 
healthy or destroyed or they're they're
altered<00:05:32.930> in<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.140> way<00:05:33.169> what

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
altered in a way what

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.680 
altered in a way what
not<00:05:33.780> usable<00:05:34.500> anymore<00:05:35.010> by<00:05:35.250> your<00:05:35.490> body<00:05:35.730> so<00:05:36.660> I

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
not usable anymore by your body so I

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.360 
not usable anymore by your body so I
think<00:05:36.870> that's<00:05:37.200> something<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.560> also

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
think that's something to also

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.460 
think that's something to also
understand<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.860> although<00:05:40.970> cooking<00:05:41.970> might

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
understand that although cooking might

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.230 
understand that although cooking might
allow<00:05:43.470> your<00:05:43.650> body<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.890> absorb<00:05:44.100> some<00:05:44.640> nutrients

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
allow your body to absorb some nutrients

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.520 
allow your body to absorb some nutrients
on<00:05:45.390> a<00:05:45.420> higher<00:05:45.660> level<00:05:45.710> such<00:05:46.710> as<00:05:46.740> lipo<00:05:47.670> seen<00:05:48.030> in

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
on a higher level such as lipo seen in

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.440 
on a higher level such as lipo seen in
Tomatoes<00:05:49.530> they<00:05:50.340> say<00:05:50.580> that<00:05:50.790> when<00:05:50.970> you<00:05:51.090> cook<00:05:51.360> a

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
Tomatoes they say that when you cook a

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.750 
Tomatoes they say that when you cook a
tomato<00:05:51.810> your<00:05:52.380> body<00:05:52.560> cannot<00:05:52.830> absorb<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.430> lipo

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
tomato your body cannot absorb the lipo

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.390 
tomato your body cannot absorb the lipo
seeing<00:05:54.030> that<00:05:54.240> higher<00:05:54.510> levels<00:05:55.470> but<00:05:56.100> what<00:05:56.220> about

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
seeing that higher levels but what about

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.770 
seeing that higher levels but what about
all<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.640> new<00:05:56.670> trees<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.180> were<00:05:57.240> destroyed

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
all the new trees that were destroyed

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:45.409 
all the new trees that were destroyed
your<00:05:58.200> body<00:05:58.380> can't<00:05:58.710> use<00:05:58.830> anymore

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.629 

so<00:06:46.419> in<00:06:46.660> conclusion<00:06:47.190> there<00:06:48.190> are<00:06:48.310> a<00:06:48.370> lot<00:06:48.610> of

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
so in conclusion there are a lot of

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.240 
so in conclusion there are a lot of
things<00:06:48.940> wrong<00:06:49.300> with<00:06:49.660> coke<00:06:49.900> foods<00:06:50.290> I<00:06:50.710> think

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
things wrong with coke foods I think

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.590 
things wrong with coke foods I think
there's<00:06:51.400> so<00:06:51.639> many<00:06:51.730> thing<00:06:52.000> is<00:06:52.120> wrong<00:06:52.300> with<00:06:52.480> co

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
there's so many thing is wrong with co

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.150 
there's so many thing is wrong with co
foods<00:06:52.870> that<00:06:52.990> we<00:06:53.110> haven't<00:06:53.440> really<00:06:53.680> scratched

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
foods that we haven't really scratched

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.100 
foods that we haven't really scratched
the<00:06:54.310> surface<00:06:54.520> I<00:06:54.880> think<00:06:55.120> the<00:06:55.300> more<00:06:55.600> research

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
the surface I think the more research

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.740 
the surface I think the more research
and<00:06:56.410> studies<00:06:56.889> that<00:06:57.100> go<00:06:57.700> on<00:06:57.880> they<00:06:58.120> find<00:06:58.389> more

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
and studies that go on they find more

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.560 
and studies that go on they find more
problems<00:06:59.410> with<00:06:59.590> cooked<00:06:59.919> foods<00:07:00.340> I<00:07:00.700> think<00:07:01.450> it's

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
problems with cooked foods I think it's

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.700 
problems with cooked foods I think it's
more<00:07:01.720> important<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.139> focus<00:07:02.380> on<00:07:02.680> what<00:07:03.460> is<00:07:03.700> good

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
more important to focus on what is good

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.270 
more important to focus on what is good
about<00:07:05.710> natural<00:07:06.400> raw<00:07:06.760> foods<00:07:07.210> and<00:07:07.800> that<00:07:08.800> list<00:07:09.100> is

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
about natural raw foods and that list is

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.070 
about natural raw foods and that list is
just<00:07:09.520> endless<00:07:10.000> endless<00:07:10.240> endless<00:07:10.630> and<00:07:10.870> it<00:07:10.930> goes

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
just endless endless endless and it goes

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.200 
just endless endless endless and it goes
on<00:07:11.320> and<00:07:11.500> on<00:07:11.590> and<00:07:11.650> there's<00:07:11.979> just<00:07:12.160> no<00:07:12.340> reason<00:07:12.850> to

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
on and on and there's just no reason to

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.250 
on and on and there's just no reason to
not<00:07:13.419> eat<00:07:14.340> healthy<00:07:15.340> natural<00:07:16.000> raw<00:07:16.300> plants

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
not eat healthy natural raw plants

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.580 
not eat healthy natural raw plants
that's<00:07:18.130> what's<00:07:18.490> most<00:07:18.790> healthy<00:07:19.240> it's<00:07:19.810> the<00:07:20.139> it's

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
that's what's most healthy it's the it's

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.159 
that's what's most healthy it's the it's
the<00:07:20.770> food<00:07:20.979> that<00:07:21.190> s<00:07:21.430> study<00:07:21.790> after<00:07:22.120> study<00:07:22.180> they

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
the food that s study after study they

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.379 
the food that s study after study they
say<00:07:23.410> eat<00:07:23.650> more<00:07:23.950> of<00:07:24.010> these<00:07:24.250> things<00:07:24.610> and<00:07:24.910> if<00:07:25.270> you

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
say eat more of these things and if you

I'm<00:07:31.450> living<00:07:31.780> proof<00:07:31.810> that<00:07:32.169> it<00:07:32.289> works<00:07:32.500> and<00:07:32.830> it

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:32.890 
I'm living proof that it works and it

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.370 
I'm living proof that it works and it
works<00:07:33.039> fantastic<00:07:33.750> look<00:07:34.750> at<00:07:34.870> all<00:07:35.080> the<00:07:35.350> other

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.380 
works fantastic look at all the other

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.080 
works fantastic look at all the other
animals<00:07:35.950> on<00:07:36.070> the<00:07:36.130> planet<00:07:36.250> they're<00:07:36.550> all<00:07:36.729> eating

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
animals on the planet they're all eating

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.940 
animals on the planet they're all eating
uncooked<00:07:37.300> food<00:07:37.990> and<00:07:38.200> they're<00:07:38.289> all<00:07:38.380> doing<00:07:38.710> very

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.279 
uncooked food and they're all doing very
well<00:07:39.039> so<00:07:39.610> I<00:07:39.820> think<00:07:40.360> it's<00:07:40.539> indisputable<00:07:41.229> that

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289 
well so I think it's indisputable that

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:44.240 
well so I think it's indisputable that
raw<00:07:42.220> foods<00:07:42.669> are<00:07:42.970> the<00:07:43.060> healthiest<00:07:43.570> foods<00:07:43.840> and

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.250 
raw foods are the healthiest foods and

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.710 
raw foods are the healthiest foods and
cooked<00:07:45.250> foods<00:07:45.520> have<00:07:45.789> lots<00:07:46.120> of<00:07:46.240> problems<00:07:46.479> with

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
cooked foods have lots of problems with

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.800
