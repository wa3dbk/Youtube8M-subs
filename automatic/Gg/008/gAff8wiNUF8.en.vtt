00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.530
 and good because you asked will 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.620
 do a pretty quick review of the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.760
 minecraft game for iphone or the 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.220
 pocket edition we will enter from 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.619
 once to main here this game for the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.470
 that they do not know it for those who have 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.750
 been living under the stones a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.540
 good time is a totally free game 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.630
 the objective of this game is simply 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.090
 create or survive let's put a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.890
 a world name 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.530
 how nice was the name of the channel 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.300
 for this for example in the mode 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.239
 creative because you have all the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.550
 tools let's say for free to be able 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:57.520
 do this of survival in the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.050
 way to survive you have to 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.120
 collect everything for example if you want 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.890
 wood you have to go cut a tree 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.290
 to obtain wood and so to be able 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.690
 build your wooden house and then in the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.990
 night do not kill monsters right now 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.790
 let's use the creative mode 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.970
 and the land is being generated is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.170
 random every time you do this it is 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.360
 different 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.610
 something that has new that I already had 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.259
 seen in the past versions is that 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.049
 for example in creative mode if you 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.049
 double tap you can fly 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.650
 so you can build virtually what 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.430
 that you want for example here we are going to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.430
 build something 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.000
 but I can not 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 like the structure 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.680
 from here because I'm going to want my 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.710
 structure which is in this game 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.409
 minecraft can do a thousand things not nothing 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.899
 more like me doing letritas 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.899
 can they do this houses 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.019
 replicas of structures 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.819
 for example the replica of the ship 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.050
 enterprise of 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.570
 of the saga of 'star trek' 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.100
 hello then the same millennial hawk of 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.010
 star wars 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.840
 good to do interactive things because not 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 I know if they still have if they already have this 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.720
 here but in the option of the pc then there 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.720
 a 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.860
 can create engines there is a guy who 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.210
 is he made a computer that thinks about 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.090
 minecraft I do not know how he did it 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.730
 but you give him the values ​​and that's what 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.140
 what what can compute let's go here 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.140
 to the earth to see how it looks from afar 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.470
 and there's my first structure in 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.800
 minecraft let's write something else 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.290
 we come this already made my my other 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.230
 structure truth that is pretty 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.100
 good this game can be create 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.160
 crops have your animal farm 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.920
 then play with other people 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.580
 you will see that this game is very very good 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.370
 I 'm here on the iphone because I do not know 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.910
 it pleases a lot if the game would play it in 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.400
 the pc before leaving I want to teach you 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.200
 a tweet on cydia that I do not know if many of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.880
 you know him it's called 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.940
 minecraft but be pocket edition mods and 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.570
 is going to add all these new 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.420
 all these in functions modes more than 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.800
 nothing is like unlocking the mode is for 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.440
 survive or merge a mode of 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.840
 survive with the mode 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.940
 creative and do a little bit of cheating already 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.610
 that allows you to have blocks 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:04.870
 unlimited for having unlimited blood 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.720
 kill with a blow do not have damage when falling 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.250
 and many other options you would 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.900
 I recommend a lot here is a catch 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.820
 of more or less how it has been 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.430
 installed this tweet simply 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.350
 they select the options that 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.810
 they want to have and deactivate those that do not 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.790
 They want to have me I'm the one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.390
 liked this minecraft video for 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.640
 iphone ipod and ipad and this little click 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.760
 so they can play like you 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.450
 they wanted to see you, we'll see you in the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.450
 next video 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.280
 very good
