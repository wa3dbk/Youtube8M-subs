the<00:00:53.449> one<00:00:53.629> that's<00:00:53.839> considered<00:00:54.229> a<00:00:54.289> piece<00:00:54.530> of

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
the one that's considered a piece of

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:12.680 
the one that's considered a piece of
junk

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.860 

all<00:01:13.690> right<00:01:13.960> what<00:01:14.230> if<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:14.440> got<00:01:14.620> under<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.950> hood

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
all right what if we got under the hood

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.110 
all right what if we got under the hood
we've<00:01:16.870> got<00:01:17.050> two<00:01:17.320> newer<00:01:17.800> Interstate<00:01:18.430> Batteries

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
we've got two newer Interstate Batteries

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.080 
we've got two newer Interstate Batteries
a<00:01:20.700> newer<00:01:21.700> alternator<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:24.610> used<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.910> be<00:01:25.060> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
a newer alternator and this used to be a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.210 
a newer alternator and this used to be a
vacuum<00:01:25.630> modulator<00:01:26.290> but<00:01:26.590> it's<00:01:26.740> been<00:01:26.890> replaced

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
vacuum modulator but it's been replaced

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.510 
vacuum modulator but it's been replaced
with<00:01:27.700> this<00:01:28.630> wiring<00:01:29.140> apparatus<00:01:29.920> which<00:01:30.310> is

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
with this wiring apparatus which is

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.200 
with this wiring apparatus which is
actually<00:01:30.910> for<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.450> lockup<00:01:31.840> torque<00:01:32.080> converter

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
actually for the lockup torque converter

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.820 
actually for the lockup torque converter
odd<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.660> right<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.630> way<00:01:37.780> all<00:01:38.050> Diesel's<00:01:38.560> should

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
odd is right the way all Diesel's should

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.080 
odd is right the way all Diesel's should
be<00:01:40.740> here's<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.920> globe<00:01:42.130> plug<00:01:42.340> relay<00:01:42.700> for<00:01:42.940> this

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
and it features an even better

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.430 
and it features an even better

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
covers but these are actually kind of

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.690 
covers but these are actually kind of
neat<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.750> might<00:02:11.050> leave<00:02:11.230> them<00:02:11.520> here's<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
neat I might leave them here's the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.360 
neat I might leave them here's the

pressure<00:02:15.700> gauge<00:02:16.200> we've<00:02:17.200> also<00:02:17.380> got<00:02:17.680> an

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
pressure gauge we've also got an

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.250

electric<00:02:18.400> fuel<00:02:18.670> pump<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.330> thing<00:02:19.570> it's<00:02:20.200> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
electric fuel pump on this thing it's a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.540 
electric fuel pump on this thing it's a
race<00:02:20.560> pump<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:22.570> pretty<00:02:23.050> noisy<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.010> we

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
race pump so it's pretty noisy so we

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.699 
race pump so it's pretty noisy so we
kind<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.850> insulated<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.810> with<00:02:25.959> some<00:02:26.140> foam<00:02:26.410> so

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
kind of insulated it with some foam so

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.380 
kind of insulated it with some foam so
it<00:02:26.770> wouldn't<00:02:27.070> drive<00:02:27.340> everybody<00:02:27.640> nuts<00:02:27.850> when

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.310 
surface rust here and there in the back
here<00:02:45.370> I've<00:02:45.519> got<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.940> two<00:02:46.630> nine<00:02:46.840> four<00:02:47.200> gears<00:02:47.500> so

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
here I've got a two nine four gears so

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.660 
here I've got a two nine four gears so
unless<00:02:50.320> I'm<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.769> highway<00:02:50.950> I'm<00:02:51.250> generally

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
unless I'm on the highway I'm generally

unless I'm on the highway I'm generally
in<00:02:51.730> third<00:02:51.970> gear<00:02:53.100> still<00:02:54.100> think<00:02:54.370> these<00:02:54.519> things

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
in third gear still think these things

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.240 
in third gear still think these things
are<00:02:54.910> pieces<00:02:55.269> of<00:02:55.300> junk<00:02:55.709> well<00:02:56.709> actually<00:02:56.920> you're

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
are pieces of junk well actually you're

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.729 
are pieces of junk well actually you're
right<00:02:57.430> they<00:02:57.700> are<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.840> what<00:02:59.290> makes<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.680> one

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
right they are and what makes this one

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.960 
right they are and what makes this one
special<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.150> was<00:03:01.269> rebuilt<00:03:01.890> probably

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
special is that it was rebuilt probably

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.690 
special is that it was rebuilt probably
60,000<00:03:03.970> miles<00:03:04.150> ago<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:05.050> motor<00:03:05.260> was<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.830> when

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
60,000 miles ago the motor was and when

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.370 
60,000 miles ago the motor was and when
they<00:03:06.820> rebuilt<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.450> they<00:03:07.720> added<00:03:07.989> all<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
they rebuilt it they added all of the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.590 
they rebuilt it they added all of the
things<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.610> are<00:03:09.700> necessary<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.209> make<00:03:10.450> this

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
things that are necessary to make this

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.400 
things that are necessary to make this
motor<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:11.620> reliable<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.910> ARP<00:03:13.570> head<00:03:14.050> bolts

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
motor more reliable like ARP head bolts

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.640 
motor more reliable like ARP head bolts
instead<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.040> POS<00:03:15.720> torque<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.840> yield<00:03:16.870> bolts

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
instead of the POS torque to yield bolts

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.040 
instead of the POS torque to yield bolts
that<00:03:18.190> were<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.610> huge<00:03:18.970> problem<00:03:19.390> on<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.630> original

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
that were a huge problem on the original

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.330 
that were a huge problem on the original
motors<00:03:20.350> which

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
motors which

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.180 
motors which
over<00:03:22.000> time<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.390> high<00:03:22.540> compression<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.950> this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
over time the high compression on this

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.050 
over time the high compression on this
motor<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:24.870> 22.5<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.080> one<00:03:26.550> would<00:03:27.550> stretch

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
motor which is 22.5 to one would stretch

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.690 
motor which is 22.5 to one would stretch
those<00:03:28.420> head<00:03:28.900> bolts<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.440> they<00:03:30.370> would<00:03:30.520> blow

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
those head bolts and they would blow

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.870 
those head bolts and they would blow
head<00:03:30.910> gaskets<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:32.160> what<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.310> guys<00:03:33.490> would<00:03:33.730> do

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
head gaskets and what the guys would do

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.420 
head gaskets and what the guys would do
is<00:03:34.060> they<00:03:34.240> would<00:03:34.270> replace<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.800> head<00:03:35.950> gaskets

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
is they would replace the head gaskets

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.760 
is they would replace the head gaskets
for<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.700> customer<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.300> then<00:03:38.050> they<00:03:38.290> install

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
for the customer and then they install

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.010 
for the customer and then they install
the<00:03:38.980> same<00:03:39.280> bolts<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.330> yeah<00:03:40.570> that's<00:03:40.780> right

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
the same bolts that yeah that's right

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020 
the same bolts that yeah that's right
the<00:03:41.140> ones<00:03:41.320> had<00:03:41.500> been<00:03:41.530> stretched<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.370> then

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
the ones had been stretched and then

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.520 
the ones had been stretched and then
obviously<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.540> would<00:03:43.660> blow<00:03:43.900> head<00:03:44.080> gaskets

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
obviously it would blow head gaskets

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.130 
obviously it would blow head gaskets
again<00:03:44.970> another<00:03:45.970> problem<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.630> these<00:03:46.780> engines

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
again another problem that these engines

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.650 
again another problem that these engines
had<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.590> they<00:03:48.190> didn't<00:03:48.460> have<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:49.090> water

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
had is that they didn't have a water

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.380 
had is that they didn't have a water
separator<00:03:50.230> installed<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.890> fuel<00:03:51.130> system

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
separator installed in the fuel system

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.060 
separator installed in the fuel system
so<00:03:52.390> when<00:03:53.020> water<00:03:53.230> would<00:03:53.590> get<00:03:53.740> into<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
so when water would get into the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.860 
so when water would get into the
injection<00:03:54.580> pumps<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.090> would<00:03:55.480> ruin<00:03:55.720> them

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
injection pumps it would ruin them

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.640 
injection pumps it would ruin them
pretty<00:03:56.110> quick

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
pretty quick

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.250 
pretty quick
back<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.700> head<00:03:57.880> bolts<00:03:58.180> though<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.960> reason

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
back to the head bolts though the reason

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.470 
back to the head bolts though the reason
you<00:03:59.380> even<00:03:59.620> need<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.890> use<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.400> ARP<00:04:00.970> bolts<00:04:01.360> is

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
you even need to use the ARP bolts is

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.470 
you even need to use the ARP bolts is
because<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.830> pattern<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.550> head<00:04:04.090> bolts<00:04:04.360> that's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
because the pattern of head bolts that's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.170 
because the pattern of head bolts that's
used<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.140> engine<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:06.550> same<00:04:06.580> as<00:04:07.030> an

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
used on this engine is the same as an

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.360 
used on this engine is the same as an
Oldsmobile<00:04:07.390> 350<00:04:08.080> there<00:04:08.950> just<00:04:09.130> aren't<00:04:09.280> enough

force<00:04:11.380> on<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.070> heads<00:04:12.310> that's<00:04:13.240> why<00:04:13.450> they<00:04:13.690> would

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
force on the heads that's why they would

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.480 
force on the heads that's why they would
have<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.200> problem<00:04:14.650> with<00:04:14.800> those<00:04:14.980> torque<00:04:15.400> to

them<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.010> such<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.400> because<00:04:18.670> there<00:04:18.790> just

them and such is because there just

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
things I always thought it was a neat

concept to have a big old car like this

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.690 
concept to have a big old car like this
Cadillac<00:04:57.900> with<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:58.930> diesel<00:04:59.200> engine<00:04:59.550> that<00:05:00.550> gets

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
Cadillac with a diesel engine that gets

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.010 
Cadillac with a diesel engine that gets
decent<00:05:01.180> fuel<00:05:01.390> economy

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
decent fuel economy

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.460 
decent fuel economy
if<00:05:02.500> only<00:05:03.310> GM<00:05:03.820> had<00:05:04.090> better<00:05:04.600> execution<00:05:05.230> and

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
if only GM had better execution and

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.290 
if only GM had better execution and
better<00:05:05.650> planning<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:06.340> less<00:05:06.520> cost-cutting
