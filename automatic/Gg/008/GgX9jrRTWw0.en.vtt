00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello friends we are here in this video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.400
 where now I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.919
 fix your spiral in case you 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.799
 have a problem and it does not work or 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.519
 either do not turn on or restart each 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.390
 little while 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.630
 this works with any sony model 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 now I'm going to show you what happens 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 with mine 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.130
 the problem is that once I have it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.669
 switched on 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.469
 reboots hold on and that may be because 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.190
 a problem of having installed for 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.309
 some program or some program that 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.739
 come with me what concept but once 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.150
 that I turned on the cell phone the application is 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.600
 slower than normal and it loads everything 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.600
 usually 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.730
 and in a short time it will restart auto 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.030
 variant that you the mistake that I want 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 solve 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.380
 everything is stuck and apart 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.189
 it does not leave me the option to restore sites 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.189
 of power 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.409
 reset phone or the key to everything 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.409
 and not doing it 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.399
 follow the only option is with the program 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.399
 who delivers sony 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.320
 now a little more alone has only been 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.320
 restarted and here it happened to me 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.480
 well here is already restarting so 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.560
 the best way to solve it is with the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.180
 program that delivers sun and that is called 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.970
 sound plate 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.160
 we are going to record it but for that there 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.620
 have to have the cell phone turned off so 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.130
 Once it is restarted I will return it to 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.080
 going down as I told you recently serves in 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 If your phone does not wear very 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 well restart it do not have problems that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.550
 can not start on the inside yes clear them 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.459
 I'm going to show you how to do it with the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.209
 program once on the computer we 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.360
 let's download the sony application that 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.450
 it's called sonia light of day ' services 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.400
 that will help us to be able to format 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.750
 and fix the problems with our 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
 mobile 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.340
 Here he gives us some instructions with 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260
 true as you check that you have a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.910
 carlos on the device ensure that the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.010
 battery is loaded with a 50 per 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.170
 one hundred before updating is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.220
 advisable to make a backup 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.190
 make sure that the device does not 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.070
 I have been the computer 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.990
 and finally in certain we accept the 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.990
 license contract to be able 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.810
 continue we give to start here we have 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.910
 to select our sun model and if 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.820
 our new cell phones will appear 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.870
 higher truth and the more models 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.090
 old ones will appear below 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.489
 and here we can choose the model what 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.700
 we look for or by the image in my case 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.300
 I have a spirit so I'm going to see 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.240
 connects 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.280
 and finally we go to the next 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.990
 once he gives us other instructions that 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.240
 are to turn off the phone and wait 30 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.280
 seconds connect the microusb cable yet 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.320
 because you see and hold the button 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.730
 of reducing the volume of the telephone 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.670
 while you connect the heat will be the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.890
 phone and shows you an image here or 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.190
 be in my case I have to keep 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.590
 pressed the volume button down 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.200
 decrease the volume while correct 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.440
 the cable I know what I 'm going to do 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.900
 now 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.270
 well we see what it says checking the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.450
 phone this can last a couple of 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.100
 seconds already look at my case says that the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.410
 product already exposes the software more 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.100
 recent in case you do not have it 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.480
 you will leave an option so you can 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.490
 install the software that will delay a 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.490
 little more and then it continues normally 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.980
 now I click on each one and I created 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.200
 a backup of everything that 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.420
 I need I would like to motivate with the 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.540
 Factory data reset and 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.970
 I give to install confirm the deletion 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.310
 of data it should be noted that by doing this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.560
 process will lose all your data like this 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.820
 that I recommend if you want to do 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.060
 a backup and 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.040
 Take out the cellular SD card and give it to 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.480
 continue is the only way to gebhard 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.480
 for the device 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.050
 and we give to 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.180
 next says full download and now 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.560
 is going to start installing the software not 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.900
 disconnect phone until there is 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.900
 finished the installation it is worth highlighting 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.440
 that in this step you can already you can 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.440
 take your finger out the volume button and here 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.120
 we can only hope this can last 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.139
 a couple of minutes so I'm going to 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.509
 cut the video and 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.599
 continued as soon as he finished good 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.599
 here as we see the update has already 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.830
 been finished the phone is 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.539
 updated or the 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.060
 installation now the step that gives me 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.710
 disconnect the phone and go back to 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.849
 turn it on the first time you 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.710
 turn on the phone after a 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.449
 update may take longer than 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.590
 usual , it should be noted that this 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.680
 performed it flew around 3 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.270
 minutes again I reiterate that if 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.529
 you update the software that in the option 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.360
 that he gave you in case he is not 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.669
 updated delay a little more time 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.400
 last it took me about 10 minutes 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.129
 already so a process with him is about 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.680
 15 minutes but it's worth it because 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.599
 you save you have to go to the technician and 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.279
 I'll fix it and I'll charge you a lot 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.349
 money being that it's something you can 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:59.919
 do you and I'll repeat the 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.539
 application is called sony day service that 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.939
 You can download it from the google 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.430
 I would have left you the link for 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:09.030
 that you can download it with this the 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.990
 problem is already solved 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.910
 cellular will have returned to the state of fraga 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.950
 and you can use it again 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.200
 now I'll show you if it's that 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.810
 works 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.330
 this is delayed around 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:30.880
 3 to 5 minutes to start since as 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.370
 the program said surely they are 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.760
 regularizing things and preparing everything 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.350
 to return to the state of fair 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.840
 but the important thing is that we could 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.840
 do it by ourselves without having 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.270
 than to resort to anyone from a very method 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.640
 simple we request the cell phone the cable 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.630
 usb the program and follow the 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.390
 instructions 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.860
 and good until the device tells me 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.410
 download information about your 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.030
 current location speaks is what there is 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.030
 questions usually 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:07.279
 now our phone will come back 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.849
 as you configured it before 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.849
 like a land 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:19.310
 and it would be the problem has been solved well 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.690
 what I hope you have served 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.660
 Anything leave me your comment 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:27.090
 here we have the cell phone restored 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.860
 from the factory already in the selector 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.030
 on 2 now it took about 5 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.500
 minutes 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.410
 so do not worry if you see the 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.720
 screen that is purple to understand already 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.060
 that is totally normal and good what

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.720
 that is all 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.220
