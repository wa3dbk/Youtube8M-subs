00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
a goalkeeper of his ability you'd

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.050 
a goalkeeper of his ability you'd
usually<00:01:06.540> pay<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.220> costs

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
usually pay for but you know it costs

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550

the<00:01:09.210> first<00:01:09.450> nine<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.659> coins<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.290> very

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
