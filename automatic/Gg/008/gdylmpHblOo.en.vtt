 Process with extrusion or injection 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.650
 this technology supported by the institute 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.590

 directly introduce this type of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.760
 Baked plastic to be melted 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.270
 function that is gas based lp and that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 later by means of molds 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 we can obtain different products 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 the variety of plastics from the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 simple bag the housewife uses is

 plastics in products products that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.229
 they can be completely plastic benches 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.219
 which can be different chairs 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.670
