00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.759
 the very good kids here we are in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.010
 a boxing of the apple media light that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.269
 sport because as you see is the first 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.490
 a forest already with a rami catch 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
 many channel told me is that camps what of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 I used it as recording my videos and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 this is the life used right now to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.990
 bring December is the best there is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.570
 of a price and above all the quality that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 It is impressive and good because 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.730
 open the box you will see what there is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.890
 inside I already have a motionless one that is already 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 activated so good let's go to it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.700
 well here you have what is the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.620
 capturing once open you see that it is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.350
 super small that you have with your hand the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.330
 I can cover perfectly is very very very 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 small and the best that this has 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.560
 capturing is that it is portable and what 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 You take it with your hand if you can 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.610
 record anywhere without need 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 of connecting it to light or the only thing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.080
 what they do is catch the usb connected 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.900
 xbox with a usb with any source of 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.920
 USB power works in addition to 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.630
 do not need to then feed 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.490
 woods and with usb works well too 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.870
 you can record with the mode 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.650
 the sd card without a computer 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.110
 nor milk 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.810

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.440
 usb to the xbox and if we put to record then 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.930
 you have here to put the card and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.290

 for other components because you can not 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.530

 cables that you will need to be able to 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.610
 the boat with all this is the cable of 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.890
 USB power is the typical USB cable 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 with the mini usb or is it in the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.580

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.790
 fuck the HDMI cable you have 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.870
 this is the cable for play 3 also 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.069

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.870
 show 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.999
 how the good computer works what 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.349
 is the program is something pretty 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.959
 important also since many of the 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.670
 capturers will feed problems and with 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.560
 that they put the pc and many stories yes 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.629
 what I'm going to teach right now and about 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.780
 all the most important and remember your 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.780
 small and super super super web 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.829
 one of the good things also that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.840
 has the capturing is how easy it is 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.370
 record the fronts I entered the program 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 stop recording and with the rigorist roll 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.849
 as a team is in the send to me as 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.069
 already taught me and see if it is as you see with 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.079
 my name put here we give here to 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.750
 this center button and she just 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.159
 starts the computer program true 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.230
 which is an authentic past is obvious 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.730
 also every time you're playing then 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.260
 start and stop recording with 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.909
 just give a button to the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.299
 capturing that you see now too 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.430
 having already done and here I have my xbox 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.319
 from here perfectly what has 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.560
 also this program is that it has very 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.409
 very little delay with respect to the image 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.180
 real of the image that you are seeing in 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.829
 I live not in your xbox and it's good too 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.840
 to do streaming they're called going to 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.690
 make effect for that simply 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 but here is the record button and 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.720
 you also need to record directly 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.180
 doing likes and everything and neither will you 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.889
 the button turns red and when it 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.110
 it turns red is that it is recording as 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.940
 you see is recording and I have it now 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.660
 same as recording me what is the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.030
 Xbox interface is returned to the button 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.680
 and stop recording so simple that 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.760
 you want to go to playstation because the only thing 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.530
 what you have to do is that I have 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.380
 saved the configurations go here 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.300
 you playstation and you will have the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.040
 playstation so a super thing 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.410
 simple the best thing about this capture 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.320
 hard is the simplicity in the small thing that 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.850
 It's how easy to use and also that you 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.740
 They take out the best quality there is in 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.510
 capturing right now yes that said 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.650

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.389
 for tunes captured today 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.760
 I recommend 100% this since it is the one that I 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.350
 I will use from now on and never 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.520
 done in a booty of nothing but this 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.039
 year I think he deserved that 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.139
 middle boys sent me then the 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.840
 capturing without taxes that was worth the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.340
 shame kids 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.160

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.760
 link where you have to put my code 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.650
 so that the discount is effective for 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.210

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.449
 kids get the discount for the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.460

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.070
 flavors
