00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
a lower price point at two hundred
dollars<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:35.040> looking<00:01:35.310> forward<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
dollars so we're looking forward to that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.100 
dollars so we're looking forward to that
I<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.329> might<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> product<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I think that might be the product you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
I think that might be the product you
want<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> original<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
want not the original I really like the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.670 
want not the original I really like the
design<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> clamps<00:01:40.380> onto<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
design the way that it clamps onto the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.050 
design the way that it clamps onto the
side<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> pot<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.790> thick

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
side of the pot with this kind of thick

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.139 
side of the pot with this kind of thick
rubber<00:01:42.470> clamp<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.920> very<00:01:44.189> good<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.700> holds

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
rubber clamp here is very good it holds

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
rubber clamp here is very good it holds
pretty<00:01:45.390> well<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.840> slides<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.409> little<00:01:46.680> bit

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
pretty well it slides down a little bit

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
pretty well it slides down a little bit
but<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.159> rests<00:01:47.640> what's<00:01:47.970> even<00:01:48.210> better<00:01:48.240> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
but then rests what's even better is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020 
but then rests what's even better is
this<00:01:49.020> design<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.070> top<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.880> just

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
this design up here on top you just

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.370 
this design up here on top you just
touch<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> face<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.689> turn<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> then

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
touch the face to turn it on and then

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.010 
touch the face to turn it on and then
spin<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.340> dial<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.030> set<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> temperature

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
spin the dial to set the temperature

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
spin the dial to set the temperature
that<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.409> want<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.460> nice<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that you want and it's really nice and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969
