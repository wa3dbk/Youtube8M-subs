00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
important that the straps have a little

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.010 
important that the straps have a little
bit<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.320> sag<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.830> them<00:00:49.010> as<00:00:49.160> you<00:00:49.280> can<00:00:49.340> see<00:00:49.610> here

bit of sag to them as you can see here

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.160 
bit of sag to them as you can see here
they<00:00:51.020> should<00:00:51.290> not<00:00:51.440> be<00:00:51.770> straight<00:00:53.050> towards<00:00:54.050> the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
they should not be straight towards the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.740 
they should not be straight towards the
tree<00:00:54.410> if<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.720> attach<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:58.040> carabiners<00:00:58.750> too

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
tree if you attach the carabiners too

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.650 
tree if you attach the carabiners too
low<00:00:59.960> down<00:01:00.380> here<00:01:00.700> you<00:01:01.700> have<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.940> tighten<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
low down here you have to tighten the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.000 
low down here you have to tighten the
suspension<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.170> lot<00:01:03.380> and<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.770> puts

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
suspension a lot and that puts

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.000 
suspension a lot and that puts
unnecessary<00:01:04.250> load<00:01:05.120> on<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.690> straps<00:01:06.020> as<00:01:06.350> well

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.640 
unnecessary load on the straps as well
as<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.280> carabiners<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:09.140> will<00:01:09.260> also<00:01:09.410> be

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
as the carabiners and it will also be

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.650 
as the carabiners and it will also be
really<00:01:10.010> difficult<00:01:10.220> for<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.940> adjust<00:01:11.000> the

see<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.660> webbing<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> back<00:02:31.350> protects<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
see the webbing in the back protects the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.020 
see the webbing in the back protects the
bark<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:34.200> wire<00:02:34.440> gate<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:35.010> completely<00:02:35.700> closed

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
bark the wire gate is completely closed

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.860 
bark the wire gate is completely closed
it<00:02:36.930> has<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.320> be<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:38.640> way<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.300> also<00:02:39.450> has<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it has to be this way and it also has to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.050 
it has to be this way and it also has to
face<00:02:40.380> upwards<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.940> wire<00:02:42.150> gate<00:02:42.390> upwards<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
face upwards the wire gate upwards and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.910 
face upwards the wire gate upwards and
you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.360> also<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.020> webbing<00:02:46.350> it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you can also see that the webbing it

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.980 
you can also see that the webbing it
almost<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.490> runs<00:02:47.820> straight<00:02:48.210> through<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
almost just runs straight through the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.200 
almost just runs straight through the
carabiner<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.680> goes<00:02:50.310> directly<00:02:50.550> onto<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
carabiner and goes directly onto the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.370 
carabiner and goes directly onto the
tree<00:02:51.770> now<00:02:52.940> most<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.150> force<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.930> taken<00:02:55.290> up

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
tree now most of the force is taken up

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.960 
tree now most of the force is taken up
by<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> webbing<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.310> tree<00:02:56.520> not<00:02:56.940> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
by the webbing and the tree not the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.900 
by the webbing and the tree not the
carabiner<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> correct<00:02:58.800> way<00:02:59.010> now

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
carabiner this is the correct way now

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.270 
carabiner this is the correct way now
this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.330> wrong<00:03:00.570> way<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.530> not<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.130> like

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
this is the wrong way do not do it like

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.850 
this is the wrong way do not do it like
this<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:03.510> webbing<00:03:03.900> does<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.320> protect<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
this the webbing does not protect the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.850 
this the webbing does not protect the
bar<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.700> water<00:03:05.940> gate<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.360> facing<00:03:06.860> downwards

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
bar the water gate is facing downwards

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.860 
bar the water gate is facing downwards
and<00:03:08.100> it's<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.700> easy<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.480> wire<00:03:09.630> gate

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
and it's really easy for the wire gate

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.370 
and it's really easy for the wire gate
pop<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.530> when<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.370> pressed<00:03:12.320> against<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
pop up when it's pressed against the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.340 
pop up when it's pressed against the
tree<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:15.120> configuration<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
tree like this in this configuration the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.480 
tree like this in this configuration the
carabiner<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.980> really<00:03:17.370> weak<00:03:18.950> now<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> most

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
carabiner is really weak now the most

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.100 
carabiner is really weak now the most
important<00:03:21.060> here<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.700> carabiner<00:03:24.150> is

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
important here is that the carabiner is

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.759 
important here is that the carabiner is
not<00:03:25.440> facing<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.010> hammock<00:03:27.170> when<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:28.410> pull

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
not facing the hammock when you now pull

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.370 
not facing the hammock when you now pull
in<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.130> webbing<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.330> force<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:30.930> straight

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
in the webbing all the force go straight

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.420 
in the webbing all the force go straight
to<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.680> carabiner<00:03:32.100> not<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.390> tree<00:03:34.430> this

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to the carabiner not to the tree this

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.640 
to the carabiner not to the tree this
carabiner<00:03:35.910> will<00:03:36.239> break<00:03:36.570> if<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.560> like

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
carabiner will break if you do it like

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.360 
carabiner will break if you do it like
this<00:03:39.170> okay<00:03:40.170> now<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.440> other<00:03:40.590> side<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:41.190> course

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
this okay now the other side of course

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.410 
this okay now the other side of course
it's<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.820> exact<00:03:42.209> same<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:44.459> carabiner<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it's the exact same the carabiner it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.160 
it's the exact same the carabiner it
looks<00:03:45.720> good<00:03:46.070> where<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.160> attaches<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.880> tree

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
looks good where it attaches to the tree

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.830 
looks good where it attaches to the tree
with<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.320> webbing<00:03:49.790> will<00:03:50.790> now<00:03:50.970> put<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
with the webbing will now put all the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.930 
with the webbing will now put all the
force<00:03:52.110> straight<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> carabiner<00:03:53.370> which<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
force straight on the carabiner which is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.620 
force straight on the carabiner which is
not<00:03:54.120> good<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.470> make<00:03:55.739> sure<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:56.330> adjust<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.510> like

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
not good so make sure to adjust it like

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.000 
not good so make sure to adjust it like
this

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.460 

so<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.310> force<00:04:02.750> goes<00:04:03.750> from<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.140> webbing

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
so that the force goes from the webbing

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.860 
so that the force goes from the webbing
straight<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.190> tree<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:06.270> carabiner<00:04:06.750> is

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
straight to the tree the carabiner is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.430 
straight to the tree the carabiner is
just<00:04:07.110> there<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:08.310> make<00:04:08.520> sure<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:09.150> webbing<00:04:10.140> hugs

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
just there to make sure the webbing hugs

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.530 
just there to make sure the webbing hugs
the<00:04:10.680> tree<00:04:10.920> nice<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.520> tight

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.330 

make<00:04:16.660> sure<00:04:16.960> you<00:04:17.140> keep<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.470> bug<00:04:17.680> nuts<00:04:17.890> safely

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
make sure you keep the bug nuts safely

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.490 
make sure you keep the bug nuts safely
on<00:04:18.460> the<00:04:18.580> side<00:04:18.850> so<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.810> don't<00:04:20.050> sit<00:04:20.350> on<00:04:20.380> it

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
on the side so that you don't sit on it

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.630 
on the side so that you don't sit on it
when<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.160> enter<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.550> hammock
