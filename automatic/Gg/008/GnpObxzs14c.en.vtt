00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
survival so uh yeah let's see how much

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.170 
survival so uh yeah let's see how much
XP<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.009> 100<00:01:38.369> zombies<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.850> clubbed

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
XP we get from 100 zombies just clubbed

00:01:45.180 --> 00:02:05.750 
XP we get from 100 zombies just clubbed
all<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.479> stuff

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.359 

alright<00:02:06.750> looks<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.260> got<00:02:07.410> 23<00:02:07.920> levels<00:02:08.220> from

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
alright looks like we got 23 levels from

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.880 
alright looks like we got 23 levels from
that<00:02:08.550> which<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.300> pretty<00:02:09.960> good<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:12.780> guess<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.320> 50

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
that which is pretty good my guess is 50

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.060 
that which is pretty good my guess is 50
more<00:02:14.040> zombies<00:02:14.520> should<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:15.210> us<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> level<00:02:15.480> 30

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
more zombies should get us to level 30

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.720 
more zombies should get us to level 30
but<00:02:17.070> not<00:02:17.280> exactly<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.120> we're<00:02:18.630> gonna<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
but not exactly so we're gonna have to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.690 
but not exactly so we're gonna have to
spawn<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.180> couple<00:02:22.080> chose<00:02:22.380> uh<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
spawn in a couple chose uh with the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.860 
spawn in a couple chose uh with the
zombie<00:02:24.420> count<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.870> yeah<00:02:25.910> let's<00:02:26.910> try<00:02:27.180> 150

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
zombie count so yeah let's try 150

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.010 
zombie count so yeah let's try 150
zombie<00:02:28.430> alright<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:30.420> game<00:02:30.480> mode<00:02:30.840> has

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
zombie alright so my game mode has

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.010

to level 30 which is 166 zombies let's

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.710 
to level 30 which is 166 zombies let's
do<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.370> same<00:04:01.580> test<00:04:01.880> with<00:04:02.150> creepers<00:04:02.690> and

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
do the same test with creepers and

do the same test with creepers and
skeletons<00:04:04.450> alright<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:05.570> we<00:04:05.690> have<00:04:05.720> 166

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
skeletons alright so we have 166

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
skeletons alright so we have 166
skeletons<00:04:07.760> in<00:04:07.910> here<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:08.470> let's<00:04:09.470> try<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.710> out

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.890 

alright<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:17.960> again<00:04:17.989> we<00:04:18.380> got<00:04:18.560> exactly<00:04:18.680> level<00:04:19.310> 30

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
alright so again we got exactly level 30

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.310 
alright so again we got exactly level 30
let's<00:04:20.900> try<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.290> same<00:04:21.680> thing<00:04:21.739> with<00:04:22.130> creepers

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
let's try the same thing with creepers

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.160 
let's try the same thing with creepers
alright<00:04:24.320> so<00:04:24.470> we<00:04:24.560> got<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.740> hundred<00:04:25.400> sixty-six

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
alright so we got a hundred sixty-six

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.170 
alright so we got a hundred sixty-six
creepers<00:04:27.170> here<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:28.070> reason<00:04:28.220> why<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.820> am

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
creepers here and the reason why I am

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.090 
creepers here and the reason why I am
NOT<00:04:29.570> in<00:04:29.750> survival<00:04:30.260> mode<00:04:30.290> right<00:04:30.560> now<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:31.040> uh

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
NOT in survival mode right now is uh

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.900 
NOT in survival mode right now is uh
because<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.420> don't<00:04:33.290> want<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.560> die<00:04:33.590> from<00:04:34.520> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
because I don't want to die from the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.150 
because I don't want to die from the
skeletons<00:04:35.510> or<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.050> creepers<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.980> don't

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
skeletons or the creepers and I don't

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.700 
skeletons or the creepers and I don't
want<00:04:37.310> them<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.610> blow<00:04:37.940> up<00:04:38.090> if<00:04:38.240> they<00:04:38.450> see<00:04:38.510> me<00:04:38.710> so

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
want them to blow up if they see me so

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.700 
want them to blow up if they see me so
yeah<00:04:40.400> that's<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.970> reason<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:42.200> can<00:04:42.320> still<00:04:42.560> see

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
yeah that's the reason you can still see

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.770 
yeah that's the reason you can still see
the<00:04:42.740> levels<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.460> level<00:04:43.730> still<00:04:43.940> gain<00:04:44.150> the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
the levels in the level still gain the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.670 
the levels in the level still gain the
same<00:04:45.050> way<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.730> shouldn't<00:04:46.730> be<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.850> problem<00:04:47.180> oh

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
same way so shouldn't be a problem oh

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.340 
same way so shouldn't be a problem oh
wait<00:04:48.680> i<00:04:48.890> just<00:04:49.160> healed<00:04:49.370> them<00:04:51.100> instant<00:04:52.100> damage

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350
