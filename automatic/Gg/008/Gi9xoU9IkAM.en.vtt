to do is to get my wheel spinning pretty
close<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.400> as<00:00:26.699> fast<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.230> centering

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
close to as fast as it was for centering

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
close to as fast as it was for centering
and<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.160> put<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.460> water<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.970> my<00:00:30.090> hands<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I don't feel any friction water on the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.799 
I don't feel any friction water on the
clay<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.790> cup<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:35.820> hands<00:00:36.120> around<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.570> sides

pressed my thumb down to create a little

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.450 
pressed my thumb down to create a little
dimple<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.640> find<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> center<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:46.460> once

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
dimple and find the center of this once

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
dimple and find the center of this once
I<00:00:47.610> find<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> center<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> push<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I find the center I'm going to push it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.500 
I find the center I'm going to push it
down<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.700> bit<00:00:50.789> higher<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
down to a little bit higher than the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.410 
down to a little bit higher than the
wheel<00:00:51.690> head<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.739> I've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.120> dimple

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
wheel head so I've got the little dimple

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.580 
wheel head so I've got the little dimple

like this see how I throw it off-center

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.050 
like this see how I throw it off-center

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
little bit more gradually so we're going

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.020 
little bit more gradually so we're going
to<00:01:29.960> recenter<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.560> clay<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.580> put<00:01:31.729> your<00:01:31.820> hand

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.510 
to recenter the clay just put your hand
inside<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.869> kind<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.170> brace<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:34.280> this

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
inside and kind of brace it like this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.690 
inside and kind of brace it like this
until<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.090> centers<00:01:35.450> up<00:01:35.600> again<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.700> then

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
until it centers up again and then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.410 
until it centers up again and then
continue<00:01:38.680> with<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.830> pivoting<00:01:40.310> motion<00:01:40.759> you're

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the clay and you can see I have about

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.410 
the clay and you can see I have about
half<00:02:39.380> inch<00:02:39.590> thickness<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.120> good

now I'm going to compress it a little

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.060 
now I'm going to compress it a little
bit<00:02:44.420> because<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.170> about<00:02:45.260> as<00:02:45.470> wide<00:02:45.710> as<00:02:45.740> I

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
bit because I have it about as wide as I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
compress the bottom of the clay it'll

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.770 
compress the bottom of the clay it'll
make<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.700> little<00:03:01.820> bit<00:03:02.000> thinner<00:03:02.240> when<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.630> do

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
make it a little bit thinner when you do

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.580 
make it a little bit thinner when you do
this<00:03:03.550> make<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.700> nice<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:04.880> smooth<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.750> can

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
this make it nice and smooth you can

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.400 
this make it nice and smooth you can
either<00:03:06.920> make<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.160> flat<00:03:07.700> for<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> cylinder<00:03:09.050> or<00:03:09.350> a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
either make it flat for a cylinder or a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.090 
either make it flat for a cylinder or a
curvy<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.000> bowl<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:11.930> I'm<00:03:12.050> actually<00:03:12.290> making

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
curvy for a bowl but I'm actually making

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.410 
curvy for a bowl but I'm actually making
it<00:03:13.340> flat<00:03:13.610> because<00:03:13.790> I'm<00:03:13.970> going<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.120> make<00:03:14.240> this

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
it flat because I'm going to make this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.410 
it flat because I'm going to make this
into<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.750> cylinder

compression is important

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.110 
compression is important
if<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.650> don't<00:03:22.860> have<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.130> compressed<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.910> could

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
if you don't have it compressed it could

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.000 
if you don't have it compressed it could
crack<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.380> you're<00:03:25.470> going<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.890> make

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
crack so you're going to want to make

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.030 
crack so you're going to want to make
sure<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.430> nicely<00:03:26.790> compressed<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.050> if

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
sure it's nicely compressed and if

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680 
sure it's nicely compressed and if
there's<00:03:29.250> any<00:03:29.430> sloppy<00:03:29.700> clay<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.330> outside

there's any sloppy clay on the outside

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.150 
there's any sloppy clay on the outside
you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.960> just<00:03:30.990> smooth<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.440> with<00:03:31.770> your<00:03:31.890> hands

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
you can just smooth that with your hands

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.660 
you can just smooth that with your hands
or<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.550> sponge<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:34.770> get<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.190> recenter

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
or the sponge and get it to recenter

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.610

again if it gets thrown off a little bit
just<00:03:38.490> by<00:03:38.640> doing<00:03:38.700> this

I'm going to compress it a little bit

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.170 
I'm going to compress it a little bit
more<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:48.550> I'm<00:03:48.640> going<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.790> check<00:03:49.000> the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
more and I'm going to check the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.770 
more and I'm going to check the
thickness<00:03:49.330> of<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.810> again<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.510> still

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
thickness of it again and it's still

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.089 
thickness of it again and it's still
pretty<00:03:56.019> thick<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.470> can<00:03:56.650> make<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.950> little

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
pretty thick I can make it a little

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.770 
pretty thick I can make it a little
thinner<00:03:57.430> by<00:03:57.640> compressing<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.420> little<00:03:58.569> bit

always take your hands off the clay
gradually<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.640> always<00:04:05.640> stop<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.300> wheel

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
gradually and always stop the wheel

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.720 
gradually and always stop the wheel
completely<00:04:08.520> before<00:04:08.880> checking<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.420> thickness

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.520 

so<00:04:16.239> now<00:04:16.389> I've<00:04:16.540> got<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.720> compressed<00:04:17.200> there's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
so now I've got it compressed there's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.289 
so now I've got it compressed there's
not<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.739> lot<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:17.950> sloppy<00:04:18.280> water<00:04:18.609> down<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.090> there

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
not a lot of sloppy water down in there

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.520 
not a lot of sloppy water down in there
or<00:04:20.109> make<00:04:20.260> sure<00:04:20.290> it's<00:04:20.590> nicely<00:04:20.799> centered<00:04:21.790> again

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
or make sure it's nicely centered again

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.200 
or make sure it's nicely centered again
I'm<00:04:23.530> gonna<00:04:23.680> stop<00:04:23.950> my<00:04:24.130> wheel<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.669> check<00:04:25.030> the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
I'm gonna stop my wheel and check the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.690 
I'm gonna stop my wheel and check the
thickness<00:04:25.389> again<00:04:26.190> after<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.220> while<00:04:27.460> you'll

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
thickness again after a while you'll

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.010 
thickness again after a while you'll
you'll<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.240> able<00:04:28.389> to<00:04:28.480> visualize<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
you'll be able to visualize the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.570 
you'll be able to visualize the
thickness<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.860> looks<00:04:30.040> better<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.460> me

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
thickness that that looks better to me

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.090 
thickness that that looks better to me
it's<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:30.910> thinner<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:32.169> I'm<00:04:32.860> going<00:04:33.070> to

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
it's a little thinner and I'm going to

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.270 
it's a little thinner and I'm going to
spin<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.520> wheel<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:34.120> get<00:04:34.270> rid<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.450> that<00:04:34.570> little

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
spin the wheel to get rid of that little

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.930 
spin the wheel to get rid of that little
pinhole<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:37.979> after<00:04:38.979> you<00:04:39.070> have<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.430> compressed

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
pinhole and after you have it compressed

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.000 
pinhole and after you have it compressed
it's<00:04:40.150> ready<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.540> start<00:04:40.720> pulling<00:04:41.530> into<00:04:41.830> a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
it's ready to start pulling into a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.159 
it's ready to start pulling into a
cylinder<00:04:42.639> so<00:04:42.669> I'm<00:04:43.000> all<00:04:43.180> ready<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.750> start

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
cylinder so I'm all ready to start

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.650 
cylinder so I'm all ready to start
pulling<00:04:44.530> my<00:04:44.590> cylinder<00:04:45.040> right<00:04:45.370> now<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.790> hope

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
pulling my cylinder right now I hope

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.420 
pulling my cylinder right now I hope
that<00:04:46.900> helps<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.290> with<00:04:47.380> opening<00:04:48.040> your<00:04:48.250> own

that helps you with opening your own

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.420 
that helps you with opening your own
clay<00:04:49.169> if<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.410> would<00:04:50.530> like<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.830> see<00:04:50.979> my<00:04:51.160> artwork
