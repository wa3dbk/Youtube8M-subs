00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
lycopene in them that actually helps to

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.719 
lycopene in them that actually helps to
reduce<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.870> incidence<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.589> cancer<00:01:01.039> when<00:01:01.579> you

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
reduce the incidence of cancer when you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.729 
reduce the incidence of cancer when you
think<00:01:01.999> of<00:01:02.120> beans<00:01:02.449> sometimes<00:01:03.379> things<00:01:03.620> like

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
think of beans sometimes things like

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.070 
think of beans sometimes things like
pinto<00:01:04.280> beans<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.760> kidney<00:01:05.030> beans<00:01:05.479> right<00:01:05.840> those

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
pinto beans and kidney beans right those

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.320 
pinto beans and kidney beans right those
are<00:01:06.110> like<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.010> those<00:01:07.190> have<00:01:07.400> starch<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.180> so

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
are like but those have starch to it so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.789 
are like but those have starch to it so
you<00:01:08.390> have<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.750> count<00:01:08.930> them<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:09.350> part<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.650> your

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
you have to count them as part of your

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.890 
you have to count them as part of your
starch<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.490> course<00:01:10.850> within<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.330> green<00:01:11.570> beans

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
starchy vegetable so this is considered

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.550 
starchy vegetable so this is considered
a<00:01:34.640> starch<00:01:34.940> when<00:01:35.510> you're<00:01:35.660> looking<00:01:35.990> at<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.230> size

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
a starch when you're looking at the size

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.920 
a starch when you're looking at the size
of<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> corn<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.520> with<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.240> actually<00:01:38.780> be

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
of the corn and with this actually be

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.200 
of the corn and with this actually be
considered<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.470> serving<00:01:39.860> size<00:01:40.010> or<00:01:40.310> no<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:40.880> would

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
considered a serving size or no it would

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.420 
considered a serving size or no it would
be<00:01:41.360> two<00:01:41.600> serving<00:01:42.080> sizes<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.070> would<00:01:43.250> be

be two serving sizes and that would be

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.190 
be two serving sizes and that would be
when<00:01:43.940> you're<00:01:44.090> counting<00:01:44.300> serving<00:01:44.930> sizes

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200

within<00:01:45.910> diabetes<00:01:46.910> we're<00:01:47.450> counting<00:01:47.780> 15<00:01:48.230> grams

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
within diabetes we're counting 15 grams

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620 
within diabetes we're counting 15 grams
of<00:01:48.680> carbohydrate<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.820> that's<00:01:50.120> hard<00:01:50.390> for<00:01:50.480> me

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
of carbohydrate and that's hard for me

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.720 
of carbohydrate and that's hard for me
because<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.170> like<00:01:51.350> corn<00:01:51.680> well<00:01:52.190> it's<00:01:52.400> hard<00:01:52.640> to

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
because I like corn well it's hard to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.910 
because I like corn well it's hard to
walk<00:01:52.880> away<00:01:52.940> with<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.170> half<00:01:54.470> an<00:01:54.680> ear<00:01:54.890> of

walk away with just a half an ear of
corn<00:01:55.040> but<00:01:56.030> breaking<00:01:56.360> things<00:01:56.840> before<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.650> put

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
corn but breaking things before you put

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.440
