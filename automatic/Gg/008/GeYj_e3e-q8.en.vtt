00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.290
 your attention is given but 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 Alas, if possible, judge for yourself the program 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.269
 more convenient faster building area and 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.259
 in terms of 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.259
 fast contouring and clearly 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.580
 imparting built in horizontal and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.640
 upright perfectly 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.689
 varied configuration 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.749
 what undoubtedly affects 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.820
 nato fermentation model 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 but her 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780
 realistic 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.590
 editing significantly 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.050
 simplified Sarkis program 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.480
 now Anna 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.160
 produced online 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.630
 which means 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.840
 user 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 changing any of the line 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.600
 there is no serial in the movie 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 sees on the screen right away 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.720
 the program has the opportunity 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 shading texture 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.000
 mapping close 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580
 stacking 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.200
 the fact that peace you cannot happen 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.680
 not only one area can 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.200
 produced on groups and over the whole 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.180
 models 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.330
 however, all changes are reflected 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 on the screen 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.070
 mechanism on the chip allowed 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.360
 faster user 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.600
 and more convenient 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 edited model 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.080
 creating masks in the program 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.430
 without going and quite design 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.510
 allows the user to quickly 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.200
 apply to your model a diverse 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 brilliance 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.310
 shine maybe 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.560
 how smooth 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560
 as selective 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.830
 synchronization available 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.360
 textures 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.679
 synchronization occurs 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.899
 one key with this picture perfect 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.159
 coincides with each center 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.339
 dressing in any fabric 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:17.680
 synchronization 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.429
 will be saved automatically 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.689
 changing light settings and then strong 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.189
 grids and spline 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.719
 texture editing 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.349
 in several ways 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.179
 and this is in the properties window 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.639
 transfer can be turning scales 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.359
 shifts 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.359
 because from the context menu 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.469
 im from the toolbar 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.090
 all changes 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.090
 gate movement 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.209
 it is possible to save a set 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.579
 assigned materials 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.419
 formation of sketch maps 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.969
 the user can pick up a few 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.999
 options 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.549
 models 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.039
 then select the most so 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.239
 then select the best and save them 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.329
 in the best quality 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.409
 can see Mannheim 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.789
 at the same time assigned motion fabrics 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.519
 scaling is maintained 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.349
 pay attention to one hundred percent photo 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.849
 realistic model 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.989
 splash or no shine 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.269
 user has the ability 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.739
 editing 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.859
 brightness and enlightenment as 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.039
 models as a whole and separately 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.039
 its areas 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.769
 it is possible to create 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.659
 difficult surfaces and this is the crease 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.869
 deflections 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.929
 which significantly affects the display 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:03.819
 models of its realism 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 giving yulka 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.809
 the model becomes more interesting and 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:17.729
 more realistic
