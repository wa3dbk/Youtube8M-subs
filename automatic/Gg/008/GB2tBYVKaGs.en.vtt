00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.510 
that's on there the way it is take two
or<00:01:48.960> three<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.200> those<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.950> offer<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
or three of those so to offer you the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
or three of those so to offer you the
amount<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> carbohydrates<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.659> need<00:01:51.869> as

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
amount of carbohydrates that you need as

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
amount of carbohydrates that you need as
well<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> vitamins<00:01:53.280> associated<00:01:54.180> with

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
well as the vitamins associated with

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.520 
well as the vitamins associated with
breaking<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> minerals

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
breaking down and the minerals

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.990 
breaking down and the minerals
associated<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.130> breaking<00:01:56.430> down<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> sugars

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
associated with breaking down the sugars

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.230 
associated with breaking down the sugars
in<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> very<00:01:58.140> healthy<00:01:58.409> form<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
in that so it's a very healthy form of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.700 
in that so it's a very healthy form of
carbohydrates<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.290> other<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
carbohydrates so one or the other like I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.780 
carbohydrates so one or the other like I
said<00:02:01.890> they're<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.340> two<00:02:02.460> ends<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
said they're there on two ends of the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.679 
said they're there on two ends of the
spectrum<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.210> they're<00:02:03.329> both<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
spectrum but they're both going to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
spectrum but they're both going to
support<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.439> being<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.740> badass<00:02:05.009> soccer

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
support you in being a badass soccer

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.770 
support you in being a badass soccer

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
player and not starve

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.320 
player and not starve
to<00:02:07.080> death<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.650> turning<00:02:07.979> into<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.850> weak
