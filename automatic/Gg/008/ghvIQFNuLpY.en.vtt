attitude<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.229> throw<00:01:34.259> codes<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.610> bolsa

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
attitude and throw codes and the bolsa

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
attitude and throw codes and the bolsa
heavy<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:37.080> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.320> pushy<00:01:37.890> long

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
