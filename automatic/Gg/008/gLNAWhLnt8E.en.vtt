people were so popular I think the

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.789 
people were so popular I think the
likelihood<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.720> people<00:03:12.049> making<00:03:12.290> videos<00:03:12.320> went

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
likelihood of people making videos went

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.160 
likelihood of people making videos went
down<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.790> for<00:03:14.030> example<00:03:14.450> somebody<00:03:14.780> new<00:03:14.959> coming

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
down so for example somebody new coming

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.800
