00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
basically the main point of the

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.460 
basically the main point of the
registration<00:02:17.260> key<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:18.190> helps<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.290> get

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
registration key and it helps you get

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.900 
registration key and it helps you get
the<00:02:20.860> full<00:02:21.040> version

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
the full version

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.770 
the full version
and<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.970> works<00:02:25.210> after<00:02:25.480> that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
and so you have it it works after that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:38.460 
and so you have it it works after that
I'll<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.170> show<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.350> guys<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:37.470> Mayans

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
I'll just show you guys the Mayans

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.340 
I'll just show you guys the Mayans
working<00:02:39.460> really<00:02:39.730> slow<00:02:39.970> cuz<00:02:40.360> I'm<00:02:40.810> recording

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
working really slow cuz I'm recording

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.930 
working really slow cuz I'm recording
ran<00:02:41.590> at<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.890> same<00:02:42.100> time<00:02:42.280> I'm<00:02:42.400> playing<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.820> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
ran at the same time I'm playing so it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.570 
ran at the same time I'm playing so it
works<00:02:43.090> pretty<00:02:43.330> slow<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.280> if

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
works pretty slow if you do it but if

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.220 
works pretty slow if you do it but if
you're<00:02:45.820> doing<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.210> without<00:02:46.330> recording<00:02:47.020> then

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
you're doing it without recording then

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.710 
you're doing it without recording then
it<00:02:47.350> works<00:02:48.040> faster<00:02:48.550> ok<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:48.970> I'm<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.420> trying

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
it works faster ok so I'm just trying

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.410 
it works faster ok so I'm just trying
