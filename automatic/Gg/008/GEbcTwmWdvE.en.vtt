00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 once cold winter evening some 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 The 16-year-old was home alone and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.580
 watched television 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.070
 her parents left on a holiday to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.019
 friends had been snowing all day but 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.139
 the girl felt good and comfortable 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 sitting on the couch in the living room wrapped in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.119
 warm wool blanket by midnight 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.670
 parents have not returned and she became 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.949
 feel anxious call them she 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.349
 I didn't want them to think like 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.840
 she can't take care of herself 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.619
 the TV was in the corner next to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.930
 big window 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.210
 she watched another movie when suddenly 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.460
 out of the corner of my eye I noticed something moving 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.469
 in the window in the dark amid falling snow 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 she distinguished the figure of a man 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 going to her side when he 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.059
 approached she was able to see him 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.100
 face 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.860
 it was covered with scarred lips 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 stretched his ominous smile 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 frightened girl froze dare 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.840
 will move 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 the man still stood and silently looked at 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.399
 through her glass then he suddenly shoved 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.829
 hand in coat pocket and and something pulled out 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.600
 it was a knife unable to bear the girl grabbed 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 phone with so much at the sofa 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 dialed the police number held her breath in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 waiting for an answer outside my window 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.409
 the man whispered she kept her eyes on 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.920
 one by one the person behind the window is all so 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 he stood and looked right at her at the end 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.299
 Ends girl heard outside sounds 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 sirens and police began to knock at 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 and letting in the cop they said they didn't 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 saw no one near the house and did not find 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 no traces can not be said 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.360
 said the officer there was nobody and snow 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.549
 remained untouched with such snow and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 if even someone recently was he would 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.420
 set clear traces 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 but I saw it with my own eyes 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.720

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.370
 something amiss he frowned and walked around 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.120
 the sofa on which the girl was sitting on the carpet 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.850
 behind the sofa 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.790
