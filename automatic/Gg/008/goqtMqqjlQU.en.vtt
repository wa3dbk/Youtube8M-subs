solution<00:02:06.430> has<00:02:07.430> been<00:02:07.460> trained<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.810> I'm<00:02:08.869> now

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
solution has been trained so I'm now

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.260 
solution has been trained so I'm now
going<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.530> return<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:10.160> back<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> boiling

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
the dirty side inside the solution so

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.750 
the dirty side inside the solution so
now<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:18.110> immersed<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.800> dirty<00:02:19.010> side<00:02:19.400> in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
now I have immersed the dirty side in

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.790 
now I have immersed the dirty side in
the<00:02:19.940> solution<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.900> I'm<00:02:21.050> going<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.470> allow<00:02:21.770> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the solution and I'm going to allow it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.330 
the solution and I'm going to allow it
to<00:02:21.980> boil<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:22.850> about<00:02:23.090> five<00:02:23.600> more<00:02:23.870> minutes

while I clean the second filter so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.310 
while I clean the second filter so
here's<00:02:28.520> how<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.910> filters<00:02:29.600> have<00:02:29.870> turned<00:02:30.110> out

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
here's how the filters have turned out

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.130
