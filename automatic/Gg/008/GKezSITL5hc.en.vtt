00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
have a game here this one I believe is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.479 
have a game here this one I believe is
against<00:00:57.199> Captain<00:00:57.530> bad<00:00:58.340> kid<00:00:58.789> he<00:00:59.420> spelt<00:00:59.750> captain

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
against Captain bad kid he spelt captain

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.210 
against Captain bad kid he spelt captain
differently<00:01:01.489> from<00:01:01.789> how<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.359> normal<00:01:03.220> child

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
differently from how a normal child

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.749 
differently from how a normal child
would<00:01:04.489> spell<00:01:05.059> captain<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:07.009> that's<00:01:07.250> ok

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
would spell captain but that's ok

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.450 
would spell captain but that's ok
because<00:01:07.789> I<00:01:08.630> guess<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.560> word<00:01:09.800> captain

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
because I guess that the word captain

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.510 
because I guess that the word captain
was<00:01:10.759> taken<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.630> had<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.440> same<00:01:12.590> situation<00:01:13.280> my

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
was taken I had the same situation my

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.609 
was taken I had the same situation my
name<00:01:13.729> was<00:01:13.880> taken<00:01:14.179> so<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.570> same<00:01:14.810> prison<00:01:15.110> urban
