00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.560
 hello to all once is not 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.560
 custom 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.280
 a guitar 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.650
 hague so design 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.910
 Chinese it's called occitania rise 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:27.200
 and 400 it's a style exercise 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.720
 on the on the classical guitar so 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.029
 an easel as we used to 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.710
 see my easel flat a rosette a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.680
 little more worked than we have 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.480
 in general on Spanish guitars 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.550
 a key benchmark without which key 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.470
 is pretty elegant for me a table in 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910
 spruce 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.180
 the rest is rosewood as we 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.850
 can be expected except the mahogany neck and 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.589
 a nice job on the mechanics that 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.390
 are quite original very very flat 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.989
 wide that are very practical of the coup that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.460
 is going very very fast to grant 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.909
 it's a small a little detail the little one 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.629
 more than the one hague 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.629
 we will listen to him this is 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.220
 or 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 in 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.119
 this is an instrument that does not just 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.350
 than at the classic little played Brazilian has 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.819
 played a little bit of the song on 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.649
 as well 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.719
 that's really damn good 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.459
 strings are compila at the right height 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.479
 that is to say globally quite high by 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.880
 compared to those who are used to 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.140
 folk but for those who are used to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.819
 the classical guitar is really the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.530
 usual canons the expenses of 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.880
 funding this is nothing to say in the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.259
 land in the genre study instruments 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.259
 it's a no-fault
