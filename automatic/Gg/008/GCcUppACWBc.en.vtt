00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.429 
things that I couldn't recognize and
then<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.700> first<00:01:56.969> real<00:01:57.439> eye-opening

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then the first real eye-opening

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.010 
then the first real eye-opening
experience<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.399> aunt<00:01:59.610> sang<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.750> kiss

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
experience was when my aunt sang a kiss

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560 
experience was when my aunt sang a kiss
on<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> hand<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:02.850> sitting<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.180> her<00:02:03.360> knee<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
on the hand I was sitting on her knee it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.089 
on the hand I was sitting on her knee it
was<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> dinner<00:02:04.560> time<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:07.099> had

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
was just like a dinner time and I had

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.729 
was just like a dinner time and I had
like<00:02:08.340> whoa<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:10.140> strange<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
like whoa it's just really strange and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.080 
like whoa it's just really strange and
it<00:02:10.860> felt<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.250> was<00:02:11.370> me<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.610> she<00:02:11.879> was<00:02:12.000> just

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it felt like it was me that she was just

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.340 
it felt like it was me that she was just
talking<00:02:12.300> about

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
talking about

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 
talking about
felt<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.710> was<00:02:13.950> my<00:02:14.130> song<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.760> recognized

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
felt like it was my song I recognized

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.910 
felt like it was my song I recognized
everything<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.290> course<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.740> just

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
everything but then of course I was just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.320 
everything but then of course I was just
a<00:02:16.980> child<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.460> forgot<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.910> about<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
a child so I forgot all about it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
a child so I forgot all about it
afterwards<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.860> were<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.190> even<00:02:20.460> aware<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
afterwards so it were you even aware of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.030 
afterwards so it were you even aware of
who<00:02:21.480> Marilyn<00:02:21.840> Monroe<00:02:22.110> was<00:02:22.290> because<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:23.010> of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
who Marilyn Monroe was because one of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040 
who Marilyn Monroe was because one of
the<00:02:23.190> other<00:02:23.220> things<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.760> may<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> suppose<00:02:24.870> have

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the other things that may I suppose have

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.870 
the other things that may I suppose have
made<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:26.850> a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
made you think that there was a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.480 
made you think that there was a
connection<00:02:27.330> here<00:02:27.690> or<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:28.140> resonance<00:02:28.770> here<00:02:29.010> was

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
connection here or a resonance here was

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.800 
connection here or a resonance here was
the<00:02:29.580> fact<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.090> were<00:02:30.210> born<00:02:30.270> nine<00:02:30.780> months

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the fact that you were born nine months

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.290 
the fact that you were born nine months
after<00:02:31.500> she<00:02:31.530> died<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.820> weren't<00:02:33.000> aware

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
after she died so you you weren't aware

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.710 
after she died so you you weren't aware
of<00:02:33.510> her<00:02:33.830> necessarily<00:02:34.830> as<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> young<00:02:35.190> girl<00:02:35.430> we
