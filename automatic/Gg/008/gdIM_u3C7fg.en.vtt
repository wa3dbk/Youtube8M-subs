00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
the reasons why we're very lucky here is
they<00:02:06.179> were<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.479> between<00:02:06.840> Florence<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
they were right between Florence and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
they were right between Florence and
Rome<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.550> south<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.179> Rome<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
Rome to the south is Rome and to the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.330 
Rome to the south is Rome and to the
north<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.289> Florence<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.039> go<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.310> either

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
