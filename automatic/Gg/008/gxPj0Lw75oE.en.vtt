00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 you have a disc cutting machine 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.990
 pendulum type machine consists of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.059
 pendulum leaf or pendulum 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.180
 there are more brush leaders with 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:24.410
 hung by main engine 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 V-belt transmission shaft 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:35.780
 abrasive disc meet by yourself 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.879
 abrasive disc for protection 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.879
 then the construction floor is short 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.719
 motor us r 82 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:55.579
 a half kilowatt 3000 turnover a minute 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 380 volts on what engine we have 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.020
 flanged to install it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 on the pendulum beam 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.049
 I had to do this transition 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.900
 ram 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:13.220
 transition frame consists of plates and 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 dozens of modified on a milling machine 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.490
 it is set to the corners 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 pendulum 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.940
 you killed 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.430
 they have milled grooves 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.430
 which serve to move the belt 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:46.130
 V-belt transmission means step 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.430
 a 2 stream on and school diameter 110 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.430
 millimeters 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:02:00.729
 axis of the abrasive disc through two bodies 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 Sleep bearings are infused into the pendulum on 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:10.239
 such corners that pour in to the pendulum 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:17.110
 our axis and steel 3c high spam 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.110
 means on one concession set to 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.500
 the other end is set to abrasive 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.549
 disk abrasive disk can 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.690
 it is established any diameters as from 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:36.530
 Bulgarian so here 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.380
 350 for 3 on this case 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.930
 already worked that is it is 30 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.030
 millimeters on one side and it seems 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.549
 so rather small relative 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.230
 protection protection welded 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:03:00.129
 and steel two and welded 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 neatly fastening quite simple 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.440
 nothing complicated 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 before engine start 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.629
 Starter installed PML 32 starter 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.530
 Soviet forces seeker 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.959
 actions are also up 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:27.230
 the drive of the pendulum is installed such 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.310
 grip beam pendulum principle not 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.780
 pendulum as it were 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:38.599
 and all 7 books on the frame is installed 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.750
 through this bracket closer 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:46.459
 show that there is a new bracket it is cooked 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.610
 consists of plates and dozens with velor 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.790
 eights and and 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:59.299
 axis is we have defined it 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.970
 gave Sarah a post by rifles then into this 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:07.069
 axis is inserted 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:12.010
 hardened bolt with their steel 45 stroke 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.010
 pendulum due to metal fluoroplastic current 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.120
 very light 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.070
 also the pendulum instruction is such that 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.599
 the engine is actually 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.160
 counterweight and 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:32.530
 There is no such clear pass on 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.530
 one side while moving 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:42.620
 the bed we have cooking us a corpse 40 to 20 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:46.530
 Kostenko deuce cooked very carefully 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.900
 that is, the only such requirement 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.710
 to the country there was not that which pipes and 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.900
 at the top were in 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.090
 horizontal plane is very important 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.060
 because as when the workpiece falls 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:09.060
 on must lie on the whole surface 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:14.610
 bed without hesitation 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:21.920
 that is, a frame of pipes 40 to 25 per pipe 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.920
 set steel sheet deuce zone 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.180
 blanks 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.960
 it's about clip-on blind rivets in 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.130
 The rest of the places are ordinary rivets in 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:44.870
 this sheet made two slots here 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:51.080
 abrasive disc and under clamp mode 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:57.320
 the clamp consists of 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:59.040
 bracket with a small lead screw and 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.600
 such a regime 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:07.650
 also rotates then on the bed 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:11.310
 installed corner which has two 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.790
 working positions under 90 degrees and under 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.740
 45 degrees 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:22.760
 screw we have a diameter of 22 millimeters 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.710
 trapezoidal thread all as expected 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:33.180
 milling mode 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:38.370
 from channel 65 well thought out made 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:41.690
 that is for testament basically here 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.690
 we have such a machine
