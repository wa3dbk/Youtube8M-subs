Pierce<00:02:23.430> couldn't<00:02:24.030> begin<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.239> conquer<00:02:24.659> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
Pierce couldn't begin to conquer that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.750 
Pierce couldn't begin to conquer that
very<00:02:25.439> tight<00:02:25.709> conquer<00:02:26.159> but<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.549> it'd<00:02:26.640> have

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
very tight conquer but I think it'd have

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
very tight conquer but I think it'd have
that<00:02:26.879> than<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.269> job<00:02:27.450> anywhere<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.260> puts<00:02:28.530> it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
that than the job anywhere and puts it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.190 
that than the job anywhere and puts it
in<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.799> corner<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.489> said<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.750> brilliant

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.780 
in the corner as I said just a brilliant
finish<00:02:31.530> yet<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.519> how<00:02:32.609> I'm<00:02:32.670> just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790

finish it didn't do too much passing was

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.460 
finish it didn't do too much passing was
and<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:36.659> why<00:02:36.750> didn't<00:02:36.959> speak<00:02:37.109> about<00:02:37.260> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
and that's why didn't speak about that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.830 
and that's why didn't speak about that
and<00:02:37.709> he's<00:02:37.980> heading<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.879> decent<00:02:39.150> he<00:02:39.629> want

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
and he's heading it was decent he want

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720 
and he's heading it was decent he want
attacking<00:02:40.680> heading<00:02:40.950> winning<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.459> he<00:02:41.609> was

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
attacking heading winning but he was

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.069 
attacking heading winning but he was
like<00:02:41.819> winning<00:02:42.030> headers<00:02:42.420> against<00:02:42.720> me<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.930> visit

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
like winning headers against me to visit

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.839 
like winning headers against me to visit
or<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.129> wasn't<00:02:44.430> too<00:02:44.489> much<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
or that so it wasn't too much of a

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.610 
or that so it wasn't too much of a
challenge<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.239> him<00:02:45.359> but<00:02:45.629> never<00:02:45.720> guys<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.349> guy

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
challenge of him but never guys this guy

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.309 
challenge of him but never guys this guy
was<00:02:46.859> pretty<00:02:47.159> good<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:47.940> then<00:02:48.120> his<00:02:48.420> price<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:49.049> a

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
was pretty good but then his price is a

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.110 
was pretty good but then his price is a
bit<00:02:49.560> ridiculous<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.519> honest<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.909> still

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
bit ridiculous to be honest I still
