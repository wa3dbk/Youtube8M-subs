00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:38.670 

let's<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.479> seat<00:01:27.810> forward

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.430 

down<00:01:39.680> here<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.780> should<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> bolt

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
down here and you should have a bolt

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.060 
down here and you should have a bolt
right<00:01:42.620> there<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:43.220> holds<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:45.680> should<00:01:45.860> have

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
right there that holds a you should have

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.190 
right there that holds a you should have
a<00:01:46.100> switch<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.900> should<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.470> little

a switch you should have a little

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.499 
a switch you should have a little
connector<00:01:51.200> thing<00:01:51.470> right<00:01:51.710> here<00:01:52.070> which<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
connector thing right here which is the

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.600 
connector thing right here which is the
which<00:01:54.229> would<00:01:54.380> be<00:01:55.119> these<00:01:56.119> two<00:01:56.420> wires<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:57.610> you

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
which would be these two wires and you

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.460 
which would be these two wires and you
should<00:01:58.729> have<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.880> ground<00:01:59.300> up<00:01:59.690> here<00:02:00.290> too<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.770> well

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
should have a ground up here too as well

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.370 
should have a ground up here too as well
but<00:02:03.470> what<00:02:03.590> you're<00:02:03.740> going<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.890> do<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.990> take

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
the black one leading up into the engine

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.039 
the black one leading up into the engine
you're<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.049> take<00:03:03.200> your<00:03:03.380> ground<00:03:03.739> wire

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
you're going to take your ground wire

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.289 
you're going to take your ground wire
now<00:03:06.049> hold<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.799> just<00:03:06.980> said<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.280> wrong<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
now hold on I just said that wrong the

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.550 
now hold on I just said that wrong the
screen<00:03:08.630> one<00:03:08.780> right<00:03:08.930> here<00:03:09.110> there's<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> hot

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
screen one right here there's the hot

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.039 
screen one right here there's the hot
wire<00:03:10.209> but<00:03:11.209> you're<00:03:11.329> going<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.540> take<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> ground

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
wire but you're going to take the ground

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.960 
wire but you're going to take the ground
wire<00:03:12.320> out<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.829> there<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.220> you're<00:03:13.790> going<00:03:13.940> to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
wire out of there and you're going to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.300 
wire out of there and you're going to
move<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.720> ground<00:03:14.959> wire<00:03:15.200> side<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.160> ground

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
move the ground wire side of the ground

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.949 
move the ground wire side of the ground
wire<00:03:16.610> into<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.209> ground<00:03:17.510> wire<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.900> goes

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
wire into this ground wire that goes

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.920 
wire into this ground wire that goes
into<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> engine<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:19.239> hope<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.360> make<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.690> sense

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
into the engine I hope I make it a sense

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.340 
into the engine I hope I make it a sense
this<00:03:21.110> kind<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.440> hard<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.620> explain<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:23.350> then

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
this kind of hard to explain and then

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.580 
this kind of hard to explain and then
you're<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:24.980> solder<00:03:25.220> both<00:03:25.489> those

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
you're just going to solder both those

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.100 
you're just going to solder both those
after<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.739> cut<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.100> switch<00:03:28.340> off<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.630> got<00:03:29.989> it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
after you cut the switch off and got it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.900 
after you cut the switch off and got it
so<00:03:32.720> demonstrate<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:38.250> switch<00:03:38.490> on<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.760> engine

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so demonstrate this switch on the engine

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.840 
so demonstrate this switch on the engine
is<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:40.500> should<00:03:40.680> always<00:03:40.830> be<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.370> when<00:03:41.760> you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
is on it should always be on when you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.160 
is on it should always be on when you
have<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:42.180> switch<00:03:42.510> even<00:03:42.870> if<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.140> a

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
have this switch even if you have a

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.690 
have this switch even if you have a
toggle<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.130> should<00:03:44.340> always<00:03:44.490> be<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:46.700> your

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
toggle this should always be on and your

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940 
toggle this should always be on and your
toggle<00:03:48.000> or<00:03:48.360> your<00:03:48.630> key<00:03:48.810> should<00:03:49.320> always<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.770> off

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
toggle or your key should always be off

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.410 
toggle or your key should always be off
when<00:03:50.700> you're<00:03:50.850> not<00:03:50.970> using<00:03:51.210> it<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:55.700> when<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.730> have

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
when you're not using it so when I have

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.660 
when you're not using it so when I have
it<00:03:57.540> off<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.710> it<00:03:58.920> wouldn't<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.370> will<00:03:59.490> not

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
it off like this it wouldn't it will not

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.430 
it off like this it wouldn't it will not
start<00:03:59.940> right<00:04:00.180> now<00:04:00.210> when<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> key<00:04:00.960> is<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.290> off

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
start right now when the key is in off

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.200 
start right now when the key is in off
position<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.300> then<00:04:03.300> when<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.630> cut<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.140> on

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
position and then when I cut it to on

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:16.780 
position and then when I cut it to on
like<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:11.930> right<00:04:12.930> up<00:04:13.730> now<00:04:15.140> come<00:04:16.140> over<00:04:16.260> here

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:25.250 
like that right up now come over here
turn<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.940> key<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:22.370> that's<00:04:23.370> pretty<00:04:23.520> cool<00:04:24.260> now

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260
