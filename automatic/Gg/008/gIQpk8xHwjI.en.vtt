photographers like you and me well if
you've<00:00:32.489> been<00:00:32.610> shooting<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> while<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you've been shooting for a while you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
you've been shooting for a while you
know<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> exposure<00:00:35.280> triangle

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
know that there's the exposure triangle

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.160 
know that there's the exposure triangle
that's<00:00:35.940> made<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> shutter<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that's made up of the shutter the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
that's made up of the shutter the
aperture<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> ISO<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.360> can

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
aperture and ISO and we know that we can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
aperture and ISO and we know that we can
use<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.960> shutter<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> control<00:00:40.620> motion<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
use the shutter to control motion and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
use the shutter to control motion and
the<00:00:41.340> aperture<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> control<00:00:42.120> depth<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> field

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the aperture to control depth of field

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
the aperture to control depth of field
but<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> our<00:00:43.860> discussions<00:00:44.010> somehow

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
but in all of our discussions somehow

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
but in all of our discussions somehow
ISO<00:00:45.270> seems<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.809> left<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
ISO seems to be left out and so in this

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
ISO seems to be left out and so in this
episode<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> talk<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.480> ISO

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
episode we're going to talk about ISO

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
episode we're going to talk about ISO
what<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> how<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> use<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.329> settings

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
what it is how you use it which settings

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
what it is how you use it which settings
to<00:00:51.899> use<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.469> why<00:00:53.190> sometimes<00:00:53.579> having<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.239> really

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to use and why sometimes having a really

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.319 
to use and why sometimes having a really
high<00:00:54.719> ISO<00:00:55.320> value<00:00:55.710> isn't<00:00:56.100> such<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> bad<00:00:56.699> thing

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
high ISO value isn't such a bad thing

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
high ISO value isn't such a bad thing
but<00:00:57.690> before<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
but before we get into all of that I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
but before we get into all of that I

to light the higher the ISO value the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.740 
to light the higher the ISO value the
less<00:01:14.159> light<00:01:14.400> you'll<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> take<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> photo

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
less light you'll need to take a photo

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.780 
less light you'll need to take a photo
let's<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> look<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.100> animation<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
let's take a look at this animation and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210 
let's take a look at this animation and
see<00:01:17.939> exactly<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.780> works<00:01:19.020> let's<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:20.100> we

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
see exactly how this works let's say we

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.630 
see exactly how this works let's say we
have<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> room<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:20.880> lit<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.590> 128

as<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.079> light<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.740> ISO<00:01:56.670> 1600<00:01:57.270> would<00:01:57.869> only

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
as much light so ISO 1600 would only

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.920 
as much light so ISO 1600 would only
need<00:01:58.320> eight<00:01:58.740> lights<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.549> we<00:02:00.000> double<00:02:00.299> our<00:02:00.450> ISO

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
need eight lights if we double our ISO

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
need eight lights if we double our ISO
again<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.159> half<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.700> amount<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> light

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
again we can half the amount of light

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.449 
again we can half the amount of light
that<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.570> need<00:02:03.960> ISO<00:02:04.799> 3200<00:02:05.310> for<00:02:06.149> lights<00:02:06.450> ISO

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
that we need ISO 3200 for lights ISO

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.559 
that we need ISO 3200 for lights ISO
6400<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.640> lights<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:10.080> ISO<00:02:11.150> 12800<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.270> only

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
6400 to lights and at ISO 12800 we only

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.550 
6400 to lights and at ISO 12800 we only
need<00:02:12.900> one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
need one

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.979 
need one
light<00:02:13.800> bulb<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.760> could<00:02:14.910> still<00:02:15.150> shoot<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.780> f

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
light bulb and we could still shoot at f

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.760 
light bulb and we could still shoot at f
2.8<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.950> one<00:02:17.520> sixtieth<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.510> second<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.560> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
2.8 and one sixtieth of a second that is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.630 
2.8 and one sixtieth of a second that is
a<00:02:19.800> huge<00:02:20.280> difference<00:02:20.700> from<00:02:21.630> 128<00:02:22.590> lights<00:02:22.950> at<00:02:23.220> ISO

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
a huge difference from 128 lights at ISO

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.070 
a huge difference from 128 lights at ISO
100<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:25.050> little<00:02:25.530> light<00:02:25.739> at<00:02:25.980> ISO

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
100 to just one little light at ISO

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
100 to just one little light at ISO
12800<00:02:28.080> alright<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> question<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.370> why

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
12800 alright so the question is why

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.699 
12800 alright so the question is why
would<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.849> always<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.690> ISO<00:02:31.319> set<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
would you always have your ISO set to a

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.089 
would you always have your ISO set to a
high<00:02:31.980> ISO<00:02:32.310> value<00:02:33.120> well<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.810> answer<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.230> noise

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
high ISO value well the answer is noise

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.820 
high ISO value well the answer is noise
noise<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.450> sort<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.900> hard<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> explain<00:02:37.319> but

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
noise is sort of hard to explain but

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
noise is sort of hard to explain but
it's<00:02:37.980> easy<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.150> let's<00:02:39.420> take<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> look

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
it's easy to see so let's take a look

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.979 
it's easy to see so let's take a look
here's<00:02:40.590> an<00:02:40.709> image<00:02:40.860> shot<00:02:41.190> at<00:02:41.340> ISO<00:02:41.790> 100<00:02:42.569> now

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
here's an image shot at ISO 100 now

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.199 
here's an image shot at ISO 100 now
notice<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.319> everything<00:02:43.860> looks<00:02:44.160> clean<00:02:44.489> now

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
notice that everything looks clean now

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.949 
notice that everything looks clean now
here's<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.810> same<00:02:46.140> image<00:02:46.590> shot<00:02:46.860> at<00:02:47.040> ISO<00:02:47.959> 12800

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
here's the same image shot at ISO 12800

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.050 
here's the same image shot at ISO 12800
you<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.769> grain<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.519> image<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you can see the grain in this image and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.930 
you can see the grain in this image and
that<00:02:51.090> grain<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.720> called<00:02:51.780> noise<00:02:52.260> noise<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
that grain is called noise noise is the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.809 
that grain is called noise noise is the
trade-off<00:02:54.180> higher<00:02:54.959> ISO<00:02:55.680> values<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.489> more

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
trade-off higher ISO values have more

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.509 
trade-off higher ISO values have more
noise<00:02:57.319> well<00:02:58.319> in<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> past<00:02:58.769> photographers

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
noise well in the past photographers

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.550 
noise well in the past photographers
have<00:02:59.670> always<00:02:59.910> been<00:03:00.239> told<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.780> keep<00:03:00.959> their<00:03:01.110> ISO

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
have always been told to keep their ISO

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.770 
have always been told to keep their ISO
values<00:03:02.010> as<00:03:02.130> low<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.580> possible<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.510> noise

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
values as low as possible to get noise

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.870 
values as low as possible to get noise
free<00:03:04.200> images<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.400> still<00:03:05.549> want<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.849> that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
free images we still want to do that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.180 
free images we still want to do that
today<00:03:06.269> but<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.599> good<00:03:06.840> news<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.349> that<00:03:08.010> there

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
today but the good news is that there

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.220 
today but the good news is that there
have<00:03:08.280> been<00:03:08.340> huge<00:03:08.760> technological<00:03:09.630> advances

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
have been huge technological advances

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.470 
have been huge technological advances
with<00:03:10.380> digital<00:03:10.860> cameras<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:12.120> there<00:03:12.330> are

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
with digital cameras and now there are

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.089 
with digital cameras and now there are
all<00:03:12.690> kinds<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.200> cameras<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.739> shoot<00:03:13.980> at

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
all kinds of cameras that can shoot at

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.180 
all kinds of cameras that can shoot at
ISO<00:03:14.459> 3200<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.360> even<00:03:15.630> higher<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.620> fact<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.920> think

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
ISO 3200 and even higher in fact I think

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.590 
ISO 3200 and even higher in fact I think
that<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> groundbreaking<00:03:17.880> camera<00:03:18.390> was<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
that the groundbreaking camera was the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.890 
that the groundbreaking camera was the
Nikon<00:03:18.959> d3x<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.760> along<00:03:21.000> came<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> 5d

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
Nikon d3x and then along came the 5d

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.569 
Nikon d3x and then along came the 5d
Mark<00:03:21.930> 3<00:03:22.200> from<00:03:22.620> Canon<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.160> then<00:03:23.250> sort<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
Mark 3 from Canon and then sort of the

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.340 
Mark 3 from Canon and then sort of the
floodgates<00:03:24.060> were<00:03:24.180> open<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.049> are<00:03:25.140> all

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
floodgates were open now there are all

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.199 
floodgates were open now there are all
kinds<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.010> cameras<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.489> can<00:03:26.670> shoot<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.000> high

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
kinds of cameras that can shoot at high

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.039 
kinds of cameras that can shoot at high
ISO<00:03:27.570> s<00:03:27.989> with<00:03:28.560> almost<00:03:29.010> zero<00:03:29.220> noise<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
ISO s with almost zero noise and the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.170 
ISO s with almost zero noise and the
question<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.530> what<00:03:31.859> can<00:03:32.069> your<00:03:32.370> camera<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:32.910> well

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
question is what can your camera do well

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.059 
question is what can your camera do well
it's<00:03:33.569> easy<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.049> figure<00:03:34.200> out<00:03:34.350> let<00:03:34.769> me<00:03:34.799> show<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
it's easy to figure out let me show you

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.770 
it's easy to figure out let me show you
how<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.549> get<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.269> room<00:03:36.450> with<00:03:36.480> low

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
how to do it get in a room with low

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.170 
how to do it get in a room with low
light<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.019> shoot<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.440> series<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.890> images

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
light and shoot a series of images

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.210 
light and shoot a series of images
increasing<00:03:39.180> your<00:03:39.269> ISO<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:39.959> each<00:03:40.170> shot<00:03:40.500> then

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
increasing your ISO with each shot then

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.800 
increasing your ISO with each shot then
take<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> look<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.910> photos<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.420> full

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.700 
one of my favorite features is called
auto<00:05:18.210> ISO<00:05:19.020> that's<00:05:19.260> what<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.440> want<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.620> work

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
auto ISO that's what you want to work

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
party with kids and really low light I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.870 
party with kids and really low light I
might<00:05:28.530> want<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.740> shoot<00:05:28.980> an<00:05:29.100> aperture<00:05:29.460> value

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
might want to shoot an aperture value

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.700 
might want to shoot an aperture value
let's<00:05:30.060> say<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.330> f/8<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.290> shutter<00:05:31.530> speed

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
let's say of f/8 and a shutter speed

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.370 
let's say of f/8 and a shutter speed
around<00:05:32.130> 250<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.670> freeze<00:05:32.970> all<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.300> motion<00:05:33.870> but

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
around 250 to freeze all the motion but

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.650 
around 250 to freeze all the motion but
what<00:05:34.650> ISO<00:05:35.100> value<00:05:35.520> should<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.760> use<00:05:35.970> well<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.390> don't

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
what ISO value should I use well I don't

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.060 
what ISO value should I use well I don't
have<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.930> know<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.260> all<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.710> do<00:05:37.860> is

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
have to know that all I have to do is

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.030 
have to know that all I have to do is
put<00:05:38.550> my<00:05:38.580> camera<00:05:39.060> into<00:05:39.300> auto<00:05:39.480> ISO<00:05:40.260> mode<00:05:40.500> my

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
put my camera into auto ISO mode my

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.740 
put my camera into auto ISO mode my
camera's<00:05:41.460> going<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:41.670> figure<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.030> out<00:05:42.090> for<00:05:42.570> me

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
camera's going to figure that out for me

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.020 
camera's going to figure that out for me
so<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.140> put<00:05:43.500> my<00:05:43.620> camera<00:05:43.800> in<00:05:43.950> manual<00:05:44.130> mode<00:05:44.400> set<00:05:44.910> it

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
so I put my camera in manual mode set it

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.510 
so I put my camera in manual mode set it
to<00:05:45.150> f/8<00:05:45.510> set<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.110> 250th<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.890> a<00:05:46.980> second<00:05:47.400> and

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
to f/8 set it to 250th of a second and

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.270 
to f/8 set it to 250th of a second and
starts<00:05:48.090> taking<00:05:48.420> pictures<00:05:48.810> my<00:05:49.320> ISO<00:05:49.860> is<00:05:50.040> going

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
starts taking pictures my ISO is going

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.190 
starts taking pictures my ISO is going
to<00:05:50.400> change<00:05:50.790> for<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.180> correct<00:05:51.480> exposure<00:05:51.600> every

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
to change for a correct exposure every

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200 
to change for a correct exposure every
time<00:05:52.410> it's<00:05:53.190> really<00:05:53.610> awesome

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
time it's really awesome

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.480 
time it's really awesome
sometimes<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.020> ISO<00:05:55.410> might<00:05:55.620> go<00:05:55.770> higher<00:05:56.160> than

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
sometimes the ISO might go higher than

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.550 
sometimes the ISO might go higher than
you<00:05:56.640> might<00:05:56.850> want<00:05:57.270> you're<00:05:57.840> going<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.050> get<00:05:58.140> noisy

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
you might want you're going to get noisy

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.920 
you might want you're going to get noisy
images<00:05:59.070> but<00:05:59.280> in<00:05:59.580> my<00:05:59.760> opinion<00:05:59.910> I'd<00:06:00.360> rather<00:06:00.660> have

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
images but in my opinion I'd rather have

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.020 
images but in my opinion I'd rather have
noisy<00:06:01.350> images<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:01.890> can<00:06:02.100> use<00:06:02.460> than<00:06:02.910> a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
noisy images that I can use than a

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.760 
noisy images that I can use than a
blurry<00:06:03.360> image<00:06:03.450> that<00:06:04.020> I<00:06:04.050> have<00:06:04.350> to<00:06:04.470> throw<00:06:04.650> away
