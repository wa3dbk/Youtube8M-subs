00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
bad for me yes he'd certainly be the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.930 
bad for me yes he'd certainly be the
stronger<00:03:54.810> one<00:03:57.860> but<00:03:58.860> on<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.069> job<00:03:59.280> things<00:03:59.730> work

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940

together<00:04:19.919> that's<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.940> big<00:04:21.120> advantage<00:04:21.710> clearly

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710
