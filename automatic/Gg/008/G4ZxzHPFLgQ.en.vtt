00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello, I will share with you 5 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.360
 exercise for effective development 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.769
 fingers this upgrade 4 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 spider movement exercises she is a little bit 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.279
 more complicated and requires more diligence 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.820
 but it will give great results for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:52.090
 your future coal game technique 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:57.850
 strange so and so on 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:03.269
 here also works four fingers but on 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 each string we extract two notes and 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.050
 finger sequence following 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.990
 starting with the first fret of 6 strings and 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.869
 index finger retrieve then 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.130
 Immediately go on 3 frets nameless 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.790
 finger retrieve then do not let go of these 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 two fingers 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.190
 we pinch the middle finger on the second fret 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.220
 fifth string 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:38.140
 extract and on the fourth fret 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:42.700
 finish the whole group of notes with your little finger on 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.550
 the fourth fret all the fingers were 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.759
 extracted all four notes after that 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.640
 remove the position go not on the fifth string 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:57.560
 and immediately on the fourth index 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.880
 finger 1 lat we lose all the same 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 then immediately to 2 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.340
 lost that is three steps we found ourselves 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.580
 on the first string 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.470
 here the little finger pulls us to the fifth 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.210
 fret 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 pen strings and go in reverse order 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.620
 consequences from the fingers back and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.310
 correspondingly mean little finger then 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.640
 average a 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:33.370
 then immediately go to the second string 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:36.819
 and nameless index 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.440
 here the untitled goes to the third 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.770
 string 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.810
 there is average again 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.819
 here is the fourth nameless 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.819
 and pointing on the second fret 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:03.690
 further immediately to the fifth index that 2 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.900
 all returned to the sixth string to sit down 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.010
 again one way 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.010
 up go down 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.890
 Watch your fingers to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.250
 they didn't come off until all were played 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.860
 four notes here and rising up 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.800
 remember that the most interesting 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.680
 moment when the little finger goes to the strings 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:43.110
 better that is here for example we go up 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:45.120
 means and here he is on the third string goes to them 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.410
 At this point, make sure that the hand 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.940
 did not go behind the little finger that is, there was not 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:58.140
 Here is this bolt not firmly stood on 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:03.380
 place so we move 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.860
 before the 12th fret of the first string it will be 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.470
 ending this exercise 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.650
 what else on the right hand I mention here 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.860
 work on change two fingers 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.860
 index and middle 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.150
 Who 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.920
 plays decided to develop the game technique 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.900
 a mediator then 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.420
 act need on a variable stroke 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.420
 top down nothing complicated here 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:04.419
 and keep playing under the metronome 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:09.279
 start at low speeds 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.279
 play metronome 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:17.330
 wants more development even 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:19.939
 that rhythm play at the lowest 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.899
 speed and time between beats 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:26.899
 play for example two notes or immediately 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:31.760
 4 i.e. it is more efficient 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:34.940
 training your feelings 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.180
 On this all wish you successful 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.180
 workouts
