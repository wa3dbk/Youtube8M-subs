00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
half to render a you know like a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.360 
half to render a you know like a
five-minute<00:03:08.400> video<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.269> hd-quality<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.530> um

that's really obnoxious so and I can't
use<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.880> computer<00:03:15.300> at<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.600> time<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.680> else

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860

everything<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.430> super<00:03:17.579> laggy<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:19.230> takes

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
everything is super laggy and it takes

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.680 
everything is super laggy and it takes
like<00:03:19.620> twice<00:03:19.950> as<00:03:20.100> long<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.280> render<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.510> hope

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
like twice as long to render so I hope

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.330 
like twice as long to render so I hope
you<00:03:21.810> guys<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:22.110> understand<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.070> another
