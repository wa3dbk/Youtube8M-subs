1961 movie blue Hawaii and it certainly

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.219

has a very striking look it's very
stylish<00:00:52.650> I<00:00:53.100> think<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.150> this<00:00:54.269> watch<00:00:54.540> probably

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
stylish I think that this watch probably

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.950 
stylish I think that this watch probably
holds<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.920> value<00:00:56.400> to<00:00:56.430> collectors<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
holds more value to collectors but you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.719 
holds more value to collectors but you
definitely<00:00:58.140> could<00:00:58.620> wear<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.519> about

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
definitely could wear it out and about

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.060 
definitely could wear it out and about
especially<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.510> you're<00:01:00.659> looking<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
especially if you're looking to to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.579 
especially if you're looking to to
really<00:01:02.369> make<00:01:02.549> an<00:01:02.670> impact<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.440> an

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
really make an impact this is an

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.890 
really make an impact this is an
automatic<00:01:05.190> movement<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.060> visible

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
automatic movement and that's visible

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
automatic movement and that's visible
through<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.760> both<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> scratch

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
through the both from the scratch

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.410 
through the both from the scratch
resistant<00:01:09.840> sapphire<00:01:10.229> crystal<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> front

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
resistant sapphire crystal on the front

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.569 
resistant sapphire crystal on the front
as<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.930> through<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.340> exhibition<00:01:14.340> back

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
as well as through the exhibition back

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.520 
as well as through the exhibition back
here<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> movement<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.140> action

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
here you can see that movement in action

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.170 
here you can see that movement in action
powered<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> natural<00:01:17.640> movement<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> your

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
powered by the natural movement of your

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.080 
powered by the natural movement of your
wrist<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:19.250> really<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> shape<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
wrist I really like the shape in the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.670 
wrist I really like the shape in the
design<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:21.719> that<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.170> done<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
design I think that it's done in a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
design I think that it's done in a
tasteful<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:23.429> it<00:01:23.729> keeps<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.600> watch<00:01:24.780> looking

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
tasteful way it keeps the watch looking

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
tasteful way it keeps the watch looking
unique<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.609> not<00:01:26.750> tacky<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:29.009> odd<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.670> mean

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
unique but not tacky or or odd I mean

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
unique but not tacky or or odd I mean
although<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> conventional<00:01:31.140> shape

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
although it's not a conventional shape

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
although it's not a conventional shape
in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.210> beginning<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> takes<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.229> bit

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
in the beginning it takes a little bit

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
in the beginning it takes a little bit
of<00:01:34.500> practice<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.130> read<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> dial<00:01:35.789> naturally

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of practice to read the dial naturally

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.690 
of practice to read the dial naturally
we're<00:01:36.689> used<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.020> reading<00:01:37.289> round<00:01:37.979> dials<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
we're used to reading round dials and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
we're used to reading round dials and
this<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.030> takes<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:40.020> sort<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.289> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
this one takes more of a sort of a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.279 
this one takes more of a sort of a
triangular<00:01:41.149> approach<00:01:42.149> but<00:01:42.539> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.049> once

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
triangular approach but you know once

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.770 
triangular approach but you know once
you're<00:01:43.409> familiar<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.890> reading<00:01:44.219> the<00:01:44.399> dial

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
you're familiar with reading the dial

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.679 
you're familiar with reading the dial
it's<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:46.609> it's<00:01:47.609> really<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:48.119> no<00:01:48.329> different

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it's really it's really not no different

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's really it's really not no different
than<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> normal<00:01:49.229> watch<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.819> kind<00:01:50.819> of<00:01:50.880> wish<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
than a normal watch I kind of wish that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
than a normal watch I kind of wish that
they<00:01:51.329> had<00:01:51.450> made<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> hour<00:01:51.960> markers<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> little

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
they had made the hour markers a little

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800 
they had made the hour markers a little
bit<00:01:53.039> more<00:01:53.280> prominent<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bit more prominent but that's just

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
bit more prominent but that's just
that's<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.649> small<00:01:55.950> critique<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.999> case

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that's just one small critique the case

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330 
that's just one small critique the case
is<00:01:57.479> stainless<00:01:57.749> steel<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.499> a<00:01:58.530> gunmetal<00:01:59.159> color

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
is stainless steel with a gunmetal color

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.239 
is stainless steel with a gunmetal color
and<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.119> black<00:02:00.509> rubber<00:02:00.929> strap<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.069> see

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249

and a black rubber strap as you can see
here<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> branded<00:02:04.350> Hamilton<00:02:04.859> tank

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

rubber<00:02:09.509> strap<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.619> met<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.069> may<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
rubber strap you met you may be out of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.610 
rubber strap you met you may be out of
luck<00:02:11.880> because<00:02:12.210> as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.050> lugs<00:02:13.290> are

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
luck because as you can see the lugs are

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.369 
luck because as you can see the lugs are
custom<00:02:14.460> angled<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.180> accommodate<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.019> strap

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
custom angled to accommodate this strap

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.830 
custom angled to accommodate this strap
so<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.650> think<00:02:16.799> you're<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.370> likely<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.090> find<00:02:18.599> an

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
so I think you're not likely to find an

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.839 
so I think you're not likely to find an
alternate<00:02:19.319> strap<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.190> could<00:02:20.370> use<00:02:20.580> with

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
alternate strap that you could use with

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.070 
alternate strap that you could use with
this<00:02:21.060> watch<00:02:21.360> but

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
this watch but

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.270 
this watch but
certainly<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.470> you're<00:02:22.590> okay<00:02:22.830> with<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> watch

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
certainly if you're okay with the watch

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.070 
certainly if you're okay with the watch
as<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.820> or<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.300> you're<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.450> an<00:02:24.720> Elvis<00:02:25.050> fan

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
as it is or if you're just an Elvis fan

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.920 
as it is or if you're just an Elvis fan
in<00:02:25.440> general<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:26.130> would<00:02:26.490> say<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.180> these

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
in general I would say that these

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
in general I would say that these
shortcomings<00:02:28.380> probably<00:02:28.950> won't<00:02:29.160> bother<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
shortcomings probably won't bother you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.790 
shortcomings probably won't bother you
it<00:02:30.390> does<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.870> some<00:02:30.900> luminescence<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:31.740> I'm

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
it does have some luminescence so I'm

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
it does have some luminescence so I'm
going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:32.070> ahead<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.430> shut<00:02:32.640> off<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
going to go ahead and shut off the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.420 
going to go ahead and shut off the
lights<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.960> as<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
lights now so as you can see the the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.060 
lights now so as you can see the the
hour<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.030> minute<00:02:36.360> hands<00:02:36.630> are<00:02:36.980> luminescent<00:02:37.980> as

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
hour and minute hands are luminescent as

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.760 
hour and minute hands are luminescent as
well<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.520> some<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.910> hour<00:02:39.090> markers<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
well as some of the hour markers so you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.620 
well as some of the hour markers so you
can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.880> use<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.210> watch<00:02:42.390> in

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
can see that you can use this watch in

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.320 
can see that you can use this watch in
low-light<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> limited<00:02:44.610> edition<00:02:44.760> watch

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
low-light it is a limited edition watch

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.420 
low-light it is a limited edition watch
so<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.930> important<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.800> many

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
so it's important to know that not many

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.510 
so it's important to know that not many
sellers<00:02:47.820> are<00:02:48.330> necessarily<00:02:48.840> carrying<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.770> you

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
sellers are necessarily carrying it you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.950 
sellers are necessarily carrying it you
can<00:02:50.700> check<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:50.970> see<00:02:51.360> if<00:02:51.510> there's<00:02:51.720> still

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
can check to see if there's still

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.850 
can check to see if there's still
availability<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.830> count<00:02:53.040> shop<00:02:53.310> comm<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.860> if

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
availability at count shop comm and if

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.740 
availability at count shop comm and if
there<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.250> then<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.640> think<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.570> is

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
there is then I think that this is

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.810 
there is then I think that this is
certainly<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.620> kind<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:59.430> also<00:02:59.700> a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
certainly a one of a kind there's also a

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.370 
certainly a one of a kind there's also a
lot<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.060> other<00:03:00.240> Hamilton<00:03:00.810> watches<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
lot of other Hamilton watches that you

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.199
