there's<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.590> little<00:01:43.490> spot<00:01:43.789> that<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.090> have<00:01:44.270> to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
there's a little spot that you have to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.359 
there's a little spot that you have to
go<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.899> run<00:01:45.109> into<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.380> spot<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.189> know<00:01:46.310> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
go to you run into the spot you know you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.490 
go to you run into the spot you know you
sit<00:01:46.789> down<00:01:46.820> there<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.780> cap<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:48.350> know

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
sit down there and then you cap you know

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.410 
sit down there and then you cap you know
you<00:01:48.560> get<00:01:48.890> points<00:01:49.189> for<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.820> second<00:01:50.149> set<00:01:50.270> you're

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
you get points for the second set you're

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.209 
you get points for the second set you're
on<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.630> objective<00:01:51.109> and<00:01:51.289> there's<00:01:51.950> care

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
on the objective and there's care

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.950 
on the objective and there's care
package<00:01:52.670> dropping<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.450> know<00:01:53.539> there's<00:01:53.750> care

this game mode and cold duty ghosts is
not<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> lot<00:02:11.960> different<00:02:12.440> from<00:02:12.590> 1043<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.970> still

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
not a lot different from 1043 you still

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.570 
not a lot different from 1043 you still
gain<00:02:14.510> 20<00:02:14.900> points<00:02:15.319> per<00:02:15.500> second<00:02:16.250> you're<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
gain 20 points per second you're on the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.640 
gain 20 points per second you're on the
hardpoint<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.599> know<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.840> still<00:02:18.290> get<00:02:18.500> all

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
hardpoint you know you still get all

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.970 
hardpoint you know you still get all
this

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
this

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.649 
this
stuff<00:02:19.099> that<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> did<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.700> 10<00:02:19.879> for<00:02:20.180> 3<00:02:20.450> and

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
stuff that you did in 10 for 3 and

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.449 
stuff that you did in 10 for 3 and
that's<00:02:20.690> what<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.349> think<00:02:21.650> deciphers<00:02:22.099> this<00:02:22.280> game

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
that's what I think deciphers this game

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.850 
that's what I think deciphers this game
a<00:02:22.640> lot<00:02:22.909> from<00:02:23.150> black<00:02:23.360> ops<00:02:23.599> 2<00:02:23.840> coz<00:02:24.200> black<00:02:24.409> ops<00:02:24.620> 2<00:02:24.830> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
a lot from black ops 2 coz black ops 2 I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.800 
a lot from black ops 2 coz black ops 2 I
can<00:02:25.250> honestly<00:02:25.340> say<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.819> like<00:02:26.269> you<00:02:26.480> know<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
can honestly say that like you know a

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.199 
can honestly say that like you know a
lot<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.470> reason<00:02:27.620> no<00:02:28.370> cuz<00:02:28.819> look<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> be

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
lot of the reason no cuz look to be

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.539 
lot of the reason no cuz look to be
quite<00:02:29.390> honest<00:02:29.659> here<00:02:29.840> multi<00:02:30.830> team<00:02:31.010> hard<00:02:31.310> point

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
quite honest here multi team hard point

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.250 
quite honest here multi team hard point
you<00:02:31.819> know<00:02:31.940> hardpoint<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:32.659> in<00:02:32.780> general<00:02:32.900> is

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
you know hardpoint just in general is

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.930 
you know hardpoint just in general is
pretty<00:02:33.349> much<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> same<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.129> drop<00:02:34.370> zone<00:02:34.610> except

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
pretty much the same as drop zone except

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.640 
pretty much the same as drop zone except
you<00:02:35.030> don't<00:02:35.150> get<00:02:35.390> 200<00:02:35.810> points<00:02:35.840> for<00:02:36.080> capping<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
you don't get 200 points for capping the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.619 
you don't get 200 points for capping the
objective<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.760> think<00:02:37.910> that's<00:02:38.209> good<00:02:38.480> that

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
objective so I think that's good that

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.970 
objective so I think that's good that
infinity<00:02:38.989> or<00:02:39.140> put<00:02:39.349> that<00:02:39.470> in<00:02:39.620> there<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:39.950> that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
infinity or put that in there so that

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.890 
infinity or put that in there so that
way<00:02:40.250> there's<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.670> people<00:02:40.879> you<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.269> trying

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
way there's not people you know trying

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.259 
way there's not people you know trying
to<00:02:41.959> get<00:02:42.080> streaks<00:02:42.470> or<00:02:42.799> boosting<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.549> scores

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
to get streaks or boosting for scores

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.170 
to get streaks or boosting for scores
and<00:02:44.900> things<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.319> nature<00:02:45.819> but<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.000> actually

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and things of that nature but I actually

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.729 
and things of that nature but I actually
want<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.629> talk<00:02:47.840> about<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.379> quality

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
want to talk about you know the quality

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.089 
want to talk about you know the quality
of<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.459> xbox<00:02:49.879> one<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.140> xbox<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.739> quality

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
of the xbox one so the xbox one quality

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.220 
of the xbox one so the xbox one quality
I<00:02:52.190> think<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.760> my<00:02:52.910> opinion<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.450> very<00:02:53.870> very

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
I think in my opinion is very very

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.520 
I think in my opinion is very very
outstanding<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.879> know<00:02:56.030> that's<00:02:56.480> why<00:02:56.870> me

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
outstanding and you know that's why me

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.229 
outstanding and you know that's why me
and<00:02:57.560> rising<00:02:58.010> tide<00:02:58.220> play<00:02:58.549> it<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.879> that's<00:02:59.060> why

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
and rising tide play it and that's why

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.150 
and rising tide play it and that's why
we<00:02:59.269> bring<00:02:59.569> you<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.720> lot<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.079> commentaries<00:03:00.650> but<00:03:01.129> i

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
we bring you a lot of commentaries but i

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.240 
we bring you a lot of commentaries but i
actually<00:03:01.370> did<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:02.150> go<00:03:02.359> off<00:03:02.660> track<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:04.099> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
actually did just go off track just a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.930 
actually did just go off track just a
little<00:03:04.430> bit<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.269> i<00:03:05.569> think<00:03:05.720> i<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:07.129> i<00:03:07.310> seriously

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
little bit so i think i and i seriously

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.229 
little bit so i think i and i seriously
hope<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.900> infinity<00:03:09.470> ward<00:03:09.859> really<00:03:10.579> does<00:03:10.879> keep

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
hope that infinity ward really does keep

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.089 
hope that infinity ward really does keep
drop<00:03:11.660> zone<00:03:11.989> because<00:03:12.379> i<00:03:12.410> know<00:03:12.560> they're<00:03:12.950> gonna

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
drop zone because i know they're gonna

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.309 
drop zone because i know they're gonna
probably<00:03:13.640> change<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.840> know<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.170> was

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
probably change it you know it was

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.949 
probably change it you know it was
hunted<00:03:16.099> free-for-all<00:03:16.670> which<00:03:17.000> nobody<00:03:17.629> ever

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
hunted free-for-all which nobody ever

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.750 
hunted free-for-all which nobody ever
played<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.799> mean<00:03:18.950> some<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.400> guys<00:03:19.519> might

is I think it's very very good and I
hope<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.549> god<00:03:52.579> that<00:03:53.359> they<00:03:53.900> don't<00:03:54.109> take<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.500> out
