the protocol is going to reveal had a
good<00:02:42.790> pound<00:02:43.330> dropped<00:02:43.959> last<00:02:44.230> week<00:02:44.560> basically

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
good pound dropped last week basically

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.940 
good pound dropped last week basically
just<00:02:45.489> bypass<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.420> 164<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.409> shot<00:02:47.650> right

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
just bypass the 164 is and shot right

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.539 
just bypass the 164 is and shot right
down<00:02:47.980> into<00:02:48.430> 160<00:02:48.940> threes<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:50.170> no<00:02:50.920> reason<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
down into 160 threes so no reason to

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.910 
down into 160 threes so no reason to
change<00:02:51.730> anything<00:02:52.000> there<00:02:52.390> however<00:02:53.140> Jeff<00:02:53.650> did

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
change anything there however Jeff did

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.250 
change anything there however Jeff did
offer<00:02:54.159> some<00:02:54.310> very<00:02:54.909> very<00:02:55.150> good<00:02:55.299> advice<00:02:55.420> when<00:02:56.230> it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
offer some very very good advice when it

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.180 
offer some very very good advice when it
comes<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.680> posing<00:02:57.209> these<00:02:58.209> are<00:02:58.360> my<00:02:59.190> posing

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
comes to posing these are my posing

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.100 
comes to posing these are my posing
videos<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.700> submitted<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.329> him<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.900> big

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
videos that I submitted to him the big

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.410 
videos that I submitted to him the big
thing<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.470> we're<00:03:02.769> going<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> work<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
thing that we're going to work on is the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.440 
thing that we're going to work on is the
side<00:03:04.750> symmetry<00:03:05.409> poses<00:03:05.909> one<00:03:06.909> thing<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.239> Jeff

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
side symmetry poses one thing that Jeff

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.880 
side symmetry poses one thing that Jeff
wants<00:03:07.690> me<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.870> work<00:03:08.019> on<00:03:08.200> he<00:03:08.379> says<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.799> I'm

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
wants me to work on he says that I'm

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.039 
wants me to work on he says that I'm
stretching<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.790> left<00:03:10.209> arm<00:03:10.540> out<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.780> this

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
stretching that left arm out in this

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.259 
stretching that left arm out in this
pose<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.500> trying<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.829> pull<00:03:12.129> it<00:03:12.310> back<00:03:12.489> which<00:03:13.120> is

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
pose and trying to pull it back which is

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.910 
pose and trying to pull it back which is
hiding<00:03:13.660> some<00:03:13.840> definition<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.769> some

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
hiding some definition and some

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.670 
hiding some definition and some
muscularity<00:03:15.579> in<00:03:15.670> my<00:03:15.849> deltoids<00:03:16.379> more<00:03:17.379> on<00:03:17.500> that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
muscularity in my deltoids more on that

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.289 
muscularity in my deltoids more on that
in<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.920> second<00:03:18.370> another<00:03:18.879> thing<00:03:19.030> we're<00:03:19.150> going<00:03:19.239> to

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
in a second another thing we're going to

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.869 
in a second another thing we're going to
work<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:20.079> this<00:03:20.349> rear<00:03:20.620> symmetry<00:03:21.040> pose<00:03:21.250> we're

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
work on on this rear symmetry pose we're

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.420 
work on on this rear symmetry pose we're
going<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.060> add<00:03:22.269> some<00:03:22.299> knee<00:03:22.959> bend<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:24.099> get<00:03:24.250> some

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
going to add some knee bend to get some

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.210 
going to add some knee bend to get some
symmetry<00:03:24.849> going<00:03:25.230> kind<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.260> top-heavy<00:03:26.500> here

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
symmetry going kind of top-heavy here

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.910 
symmetry going kind of top-heavy here
look<00:03:27.459> more<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.819> tea<00:03:28.209> than<00:03:28.659> an<00:03:28.810> X<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.799> we're

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
look more like a tea than an X so we're

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.500 
look more like a tea than an X so we're
going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.099> add<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.280> knee<00:03:30.730> bend<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.239> get<00:03:31.480> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
going to add that knee bend and get a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.449 
going to add that knee bend and get a
little<00:03:31.629> bit<00:03:31.840> more<00:03:31.989> base<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:32.920> again<00:03:33.159> here

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
little bit more base going so again here

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.309 
little bit more base going so again here
basically<00:03:33.970> Jeff<00:03:34.390> wants<00:03:34.720> me<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.930> get<00:03:35.109> in<00:03:35.200> my

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
basically Jeff wants me to get in my

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.360 
basically Jeff wants me to get in my
symmetry<00:03:35.799> pose<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.370> then<00:03:36.909> turn<00:03:37.569> my<00:03:37.900> torso

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
symmetry pose and then turn my torso

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.909 
symmetry pose and then turn my torso
from<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.579> trunk<00:03:39.909> and<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.750> turn<00:03:41.109> until<00:03:41.590> I'm

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
from the trunk and just turn until I'm

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.500 
from the trunk and just turn until I'm
in<00:03:42.099> the<00:03:42.340> position<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.880> he<00:03:43.060> wants<00:03:43.299> from<00:03:43.359> my

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
in the position that he wants from my

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.780 
in the position that he wants from my
side<00:03:43.720> symmetry<00:03:44.200> pose<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.680> then<00:03:45.130> relax<00:03:45.459> my

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
side symmetry pose and then relax my

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.629 
side symmetry pose and then relax my
arms<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:46.810> bit<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.579> go

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
arms just a little bit so there you go

00:03:48.639 --> 00:04:08.430 
arms just a little bit so there you go
thanks<00:03:49.120> again<00:03:49.209> 3dm<00:03:49.750> Jerry
