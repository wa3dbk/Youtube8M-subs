put it on the scale and here some

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.600 
put it on the scale and here some
weights<00:03:40.620> meaningless<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:42.060> oh<00:03:42.330> man

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
it's weightless no silly stuff this one

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.449 
it's weightless no silly stuff this one
weighs<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.690> little<00:03:49.019> less<00:03:49.670> 39<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.940> my<00:03:53.940> conclusion

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459
