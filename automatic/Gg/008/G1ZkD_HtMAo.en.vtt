stuff grubby of the four probes in gas
all<00:01:59.310> looking<00:01:59.670> fairly<00:01:59.820> normal

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329

yeah things not not really deviating
from<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> norm<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.829> far<00:02:05.130> we're<00:02:05.909> gonna<00:02:06.060> be

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
from the norm so far we're gonna be

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.109

well I know the expansion timing I know
the<00:02:47.870> gas<00:02:48.020> timings<00:02:48.440> on<00:02:48.530> how<00:02:48.590> many<00:02:48.650> growing<00:02:49.160> how

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
the gas timings on how many growing how

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.550 
the gas timings on how many growing how
many<00:02:49.700> poems<00:02:49.820> you've<00:02:50.000> had<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.390> gas<00:02:50.690> etc<00:02:50.900> etc<00:02:51.230> etc

many poems you've had in gas etc etc etc
all<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.550> pieces<00:02:52.850> together<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:53.660> quite

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
all of this pieces together really quite

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.630 
all of this pieces together really quite
swish<00:02:54.170> everyone<00:02:54.740> taser<00:02:54.980> side<00:02:55.310> we've<00:02:55.490> got<00:02:55.520> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
swish everyone taser side we've got the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.100 
swish everyone taser side we've got the
factory<00:02:55.940> coming<00:02:56.270> down<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.570> reactor<00:02:56.930> there

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
factory coming down the reactor there

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.810 
factory coming down the reactor there
then<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> command<00:02:58.040> center<00:02:58.310> being<00:02:58.459> building<00:02:58.760> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
then the command center being building a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.550 
then the command center being building a
high<00:02:58.970> ground<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.300> this<00:02:59.390> isn't<00:02:59.630> an<00:02:59.840> all<00:02:59.959> in<00:03:00.140> but

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
high ground so this isn't an all in but

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.250 
high ground so this isn't an all in but
I<00:03:00.590> changed<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.920> till<00:03:01.070> one<00:03:01.250> base<00:03:01.400> play<00:03:01.610> and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
I changed you till one base play and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
I changed you till one base play and
because<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.470> command<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:03.890> up<00:03:03.980> at<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.130> high

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
because the command is up at the high

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.560 
because the command is up at the high
ground<00:03:04.459> though<00:03:04.610> it's<00:03:04.910> gonna<00:03:05.000> be<00:03:05.090> very<00:03:05.270> hard

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
ground though it's gonna be very hard

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.180 
ground though it's gonna be very hard
for<00:03:05.660> grubby<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.260> see<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.830> not<00:03:06.980> gonna<00:03:07.130> be

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
for grubby to see that it's not gonna be

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.220 
for grubby to see that it's not gonna be
a<00:03:07.310> one<00:03:07.490> base<00:03:07.640> play<00:03:07.880> at<00:03:08.060> least<00:03:08.480> for<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.140> near

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
a one base play at least for the near

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.620 
a one base play at least for the near
future<00:03:09.550> mmm<00:03:10.580> that's<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.850> great<00:03:11.150> point<00:03:11.420> actually

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
future mmm that's a great point actually

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.870 
future mmm that's a great point actually
and<00:03:11.959> that's<00:03:12.470> important<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:12.980> Teja<00:03:13.310> because<00:03:13.700> we

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
and that's important for Teja because we

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.580 
and that's important for Teja because we
saw<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.360> example<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.840> second<00:03:15.200> Supply<00:03:15.530> Depot

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
saw for example the second Supply Depot

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.290 
saw for example the second Supply Depot
at<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.070> ramp<00:03:16.250> actually<00:03:16.670> got<00:03:16.820> built<00:03:17.030> very

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
at the ramp actually got built very

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.759 
at the ramp actually got built very
early<00:03:17.630> when<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:18.019> game<00:03:18.170> now<00:03:18.350> why<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.650> that

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
early when this game now why is that

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.160 
early when this game now why is that
important<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.610> ask

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
important you ask

djaro<00:03:21.170> well<00:03:21.530> let<00:03:21.920> me<00:03:21.950> explain<00:03:22.160> he<00:03:22.820> put<00:03:23.150> that

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
djaro well let me explain he put that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.420 
djaro well let me explain he put that
down<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.680> probe<00:03:24.950> wouldn't<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.310> any

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
down so that the probe wouldn't get any

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.580 
down so that the probe wouldn't get any
early<00:03:25.760> scouting<00:03:26.209> information<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.870> very<00:03:27.230> very

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
early scouting information and very very

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.040 
early scouting information and very very
deliberate<00:03:28.190> there<00:03:28.340> from<00:03:28.519> Teja<00:03:28.810> obviously<00:03:29.810> not

putting the command center on the high

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.430 
putting the command center on the high
ground<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.420> natural<00:03:35.690> continuation

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
ground is just the natural continuation

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.130 
ground is just the natural continuation
of<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.730> mothership<00:03:38.030> core<00:03:38.330> here<00:03:38.660> moving

out across the map might try and get a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.550 
out across the map might try and get a
glimpse<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.420> decent<00:03:41.780> positioning<00:03:42.350> of<00:03:42.410> that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.190 
glimpse but a decent positioning of that
Marines<00:03:43.000> could<00:03:44.000> prevent<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.600> if<00:03:44.780> they<00:03:44.959> weren't

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
Marines could prevent it if they weren't

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.539 
Marines could prevent it if they weren't
moving<00:03:45.290> out<00:03:45.530> across<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.920> map<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.310> looks

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
moving out across the map so it looks

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.270 
moving out across the map so it looks
like<00:03:46.610> grubby<00:03:47.150> will<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.959> able<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.380> sneak<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
like grubby will be able to sneak in a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.800 
like grubby will be able to sneak in a
little<00:03:49.850> bit<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.030> scouting<00:03:50.239> information

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
little bit of scouting information

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.110 
little bit of scouting information
anyway<00:03:51.200> now<00:03:52.100> it's<00:03:52.370> important<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.790> note<00:03:52.970> as

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
anyway now it's important to note as

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.470 
anyway now it's important to note as
well<00:03:54.070> that's<00:03:55.070> target<00:03:55.430> coming<00:03:55.610> down<00:03:55.820> has<00:03:56.150> not

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
well that's target coming down has not

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.229 
well that's target coming down has not
yet<00:03:56.810> committed<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:58.610> making<00:03:58.820> anything<00:03:59.060> but

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
yet committed to making anything but

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.340 
yet committed to making anything but
there<00:03:59.360> goes<00:03:59.390> down<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.690> Phoenix<00:03:59.959> okay<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
there goes down the Phoenix okay so the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.960 
there goes down the Phoenix okay so the
advantage<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.769> Phoenix<00:04:01.070> is<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.670> you've<00:04:01.790> got

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
advantage of Phoenix is that you've got

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.699 
advantage of Phoenix is that you've got
high<00:04:02.150> mobility<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:03.170> can<00:04:03.200> do<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.440> lot<00:04:03.680> of

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
high mobility you can do a lot of

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.190 
high mobility you can do a lot of
harassment<00:04:04.340> with<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:05.840> can<00:04:05.959> also<00:04:06.080> have

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
harassment with it and you can also have

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.630 
harassment with it and you can also have
a<00:04:06.230> nice<00:04:06.380> job<00:04:06.560> trying<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.830> pick<00:04:06.980> off<00:04:07.130> medevacs

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
a nice job trying to pick off medevacs

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.850 
a nice job trying to pick off medevacs
if<00:04:07.820> they<00:04:08.000> are<00:04:08.330> coming<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.930> for<00:04:09.049> drops<00:04:09.290> but<00:04:09.709> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
if they are coming in for drops but the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.170 
if they are coming in for drops but the
downside<00:04:10.070> is<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.459> doesn't<00:04:10.580> have<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.820> share

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
downside is it doesn't have to share

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.410 
downside is it doesn't have to share
more<00:04:11.390> DPS<00:04:11.980> say<00:04:12.980> avoid<00:04:13.220> weight<00:04:13.459> or<00:04:13.730> the

more DPS say avoid weight or the

more DPS say avoid weight or the

they get the century
yes<00:04:20.960> they<00:04:21.170> will<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.650> they're<00:04:21.740> gonna<00:04:21.830> be

of polishing this off they're getting a

from<00:04:30.740> liquid<00:04:31.310> teacher<00:04:31.580> now<00:04:31.850> grubby<00:04:32.180> it's

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
from liquid teacher now grubby it's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.700 
from liquid teacher now grubby it's
important<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.080> note<00:04:33.230> that<00:04:33.260> when<00:04:33.590> the

important to note that when the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.380 
important to note that when the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
of Teja he actually missed see the

of Teja he actually missed see the
command<00:04:38.240> center<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.170> I<00:04:39.410> wonder<00:04:40.160> if<00:04:40.340> grubby

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
command center so I wonder if grubby

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.180 
command center so I wonder if grubby
suspects<00:04:42.200> it's<00:04:42.320> one<00:04:42.530> bass<00:04:42.710> player<00:04:42.890> if<00:04:43.040> he's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
suspects it's one bass player if he's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.710 
suspects it's one bass player if he's
assuming<00:04:43.730> that<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.970> command<00:04:44.210> center<00:04:44.480> is<00:04:44.570> down

assuming that the command center is down

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.090 
assuming that the command center is down
he<00:04:44.900> might<00:04:45.080> be<00:04:45.290> able<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.530> work<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.770> out<00:04:45.830> from<00:04:45.920> the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
he might be able to work it out from the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.220 
he might be able to work it out from the
timing<00:04:46.370> actually<00:04:46.670> of<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.450> star<00:04:47.690> board<00:04:47.930> going

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
timing actually of the star board going

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
timing actually of the star board going
down<00:04:48.380> because<00:04:48.560> we<00:04:48.650> could<00:04:48.770> actually<00:04:48.920> see<00:04:49.220> it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
down because we could actually see it

down because we could actually see it
about<00:04:49.490> halfway<00:04:49.730> done<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.080> far<00:04:51.740> if<00:04:51.980> we<00:04:52.040> take<00:04:52.190> a

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
about halfway done so far if we take a

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.470 
about halfway done so far if we take a
look<00:04:52.340> at<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.520> worker<00:04:52.700> situation<00:04:53.300> it's

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
look at the worker situation it's

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.110 
look at the worker situation it's
thirsty<00:04:53.810> all<00:04:54.230> at<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.130> moment<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:55.640> a<00:04:55.670> slight

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
thirsty all at the moment so a slight

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.760 
thirsty all at the moment so a slight
economic<00:04:56.600> advantage<00:04:56.960> potential<00:04:57.410> there<00:04:57.530> as<00:04:57.680> he

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
economic advantage potential there as he

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.380 
economic advantage potential there as he
lands<00:04:58.010> his<00:04:58.160> natural<00:04:58.520> command<00:04:58.760> center<00:04:59.000> will<00:04:59.240> be

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
lands his natural command center will be

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.960 
lands his natural command center will be
able<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.750> get<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.290> couple<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.130> those<00:05:01.340> mules<00:05:01.640> down

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
able to get a couple of those mules down

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.730 
able to get a couple of those mules down
in<00:05:02.150> mining<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:02.570> now<00:05:03.080> this<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.500> part<00:05:03.650> of

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
in mining and now this is the part of

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.870 
in mining and now this is the part of
the<00:05:03.860> game<00:05:03.980> where<00:05:04.160> he's<00:05:04.280> just<00:05:04.370> gonna<00:05:04.550> want<00:05:04.790> to
