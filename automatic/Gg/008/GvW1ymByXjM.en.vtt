jeans in this clip I want to talk about
the<00:00:09.870> difference<00:00:10.230> between<00:00:10.519> starch<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.820> sizing

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the difference between starch and sizing

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.900 
the difference between starch and sizing
there<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> difference<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.250> cannot<00:00:14.639> use

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
there is a difference you cannot use

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.900 
there is a difference you cannot use
starch<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.690> synthetic<00:00:16.379> fabrics<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
starch on synthetic fabrics so like a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330 
starch on synthetic fabrics so like a
shirt<00:00:18.240> that's<00:00:18.510> half<00:00:18.960> poly<00:00:19.260> half<00:00:19.560> cotton<00:00:20.010> you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
shirt that's half poly half cotton you

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.310 
shirt that's half poly half cotton you
can't<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.820> starch<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.330> need<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> use<00:00:21.750> sizing

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
can't use starch you need to use sizing

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.009 
can't use starch you need to use sizing
it<00:00:22.680> does<00:00:22.920> almost<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> same<00:00:23.910> thing<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.900> don't

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it does almost the same thing you don't

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.130 
it does almost the same thing you don't
get<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.350> stiff<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.939> appearance<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:27.630> sizing

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.720 
get as stiff and appearance from sizing
but<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> definitely<00:00:28.470> does<00:00:28.800> give<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.340> garment

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
but it definitely does give the garment

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.370 
but it definitely does give the garment
some<00:00:30.240> body<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.349> could<00:00:31.470> also<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.160> on

some<00:00:47.640> people<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.030> starch<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.050> washing

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
some people put starch in the washing

some people put starch in the washing
machine<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> starch

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
machine I don't have that kind of starch

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
machine I don't have that kind of starch
here<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.079> me<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
here with me but you can do that you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
here with me but you can do that you
would<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.510> final<00:00:55.020> cycle<00:00:55.379> some

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
would put it in the final cycle some

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.470 
would put it in the final cycle some
people<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:56.070> corn<00:00:56.699> starch<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.180> from<00:00:57.360> their

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
people use corn starch right from their

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
people use corn starch right from their
kitchen<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> work<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.879> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
kitchen it's a lot of work to do that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
kitchen it's a lot of work to do that
and<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.289> too<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.250> laundry

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and if you put too much in your laundry

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
and if you put too much in your laundry
can<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.449> gummy<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.439> most<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.119> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can get gummy so what most people do is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
can get gummy so what most people do is
they<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.140> liquid<00:01:07.470> starch<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
they use the liquid starch this is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.340 
they use the liquid starch this is
actually<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:09.180> favorite<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> starching

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
actually my favorite way of starching

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.230 
actually my favorite way of starching
there's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.430> recipe<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
there's a little recipe on the back of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.280 
there's a little recipe on the back of
the<00:01:12.299> bottle<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> tells<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.250> ratio<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
the bottle that tells you the ratio of

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
the bottle that tells you the ratio of
the<00:01:16.290> starch<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> bottle<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> water<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> if

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the starch of the bottle to water so if

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
the starch of the bottle to water so if
you<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.939> napkins<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.150> whatever<00:01:21.420> you're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you want napkins or whatever you're

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.070 
you want napkins or whatever you're
using<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.729> stiff<00:01:24.080> or

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
using it for to be really stiff or

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
using it for to be really stiff or
medium<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.159> less<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.580> does<00:01:26.729> give<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
medium or less it does give you that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.649 
medium or less it does give you that
formula<00:01:28.400> this<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.549> another<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> starch

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
formula this is another kind of starch

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499 
formula this is another kind of starch
it's<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.200> powdered<00:01:31.619> form<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.610> pretty<00:01:33.299> hard

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's in powdered form it's pretty hard

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's in powdered form it's pretty hard
to<00:01:33.600> find<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.020> most<00:01:34.380> people<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to find this most people don't use this

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.859 
to find this most people don't use this
anymore<00:01:35.460> though<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.000> people<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.390> swear<00:01:36.420> by

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
anymore though some people do swear by

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.160 
anymore though some people do swear by
it<00:01:37.670> because<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:39.030> economical<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.930> will

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it because it's more economical you will

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.399 
it because it's more economical you will
go<00:01:41.009> through<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> bottle<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.090> quickly

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
go through a bottle this pretty quickly

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.510 
go through a bottle this pretty quickly
this<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> last<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.040> really

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
this is going to last a really really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
this is going to last a really really
long<00:01:44.729> time<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.990> really

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
long time but you do have to be really

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
long time but you do have to be really
careful<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> mix<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
careful when you mix it up that you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.639 
careful when you mix it up that you
don't<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.630> any<00:01:48.869> lumps<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> like

starch<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.380> except<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.070> does<00:02:19.370> not<00:02:19.490> have

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
starch as this except this does not have

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
an aerosol this has a spray bottle one

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.330 
an aerosol this has a spray bottle one
of<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.350> most<00:02:24.500> frustrating<00:02:24.680> things<00:02:25.040> about

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
of the most frustrating things about

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.580 
of the most frustrating things about
using<00:02:25.640> starch<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.840> aerosol<00:02:27.290> cans

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
using starch is that the aerosol cans

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.040 
using starch is that the aerosol cans
can<00:02:27.890> get<00:02:28.070> clogged<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.300> nozzles<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.930> no

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
can get clogged the nozzles and no

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.200 
can get clogged the nozzles and no
matter<00:02:30.200> how<00:02:30.440> hard<00:02:30.650> dry<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.550> can<00:02:31.580> unclog<00:02:32.180> that

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
matter how hard dry you can unclog that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.820 
matter how hard dry you can unclog that
nozzle<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.960> wanted<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> toss<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
nozzle and you wanted to toss in the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.370 
nozzle and you wanted to toss in the
thing<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.610> trash<00:02:34.820> can<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.360> that's<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
thing in the trash can so that's a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.190 
thing in the trash can so that's a
little<00:02:36.470> frustrating
