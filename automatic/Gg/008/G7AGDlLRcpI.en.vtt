00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.259
 hello everyone certainly gami I hope 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.889
 that you're fine 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.170
 today find themselves for a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 new video on clash of clan so 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.609
 so today we will test the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.380
 wizards these famous sources here what 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.109
 I waited for a while so there 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 here I went hdv 10 g / d unlock 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.380
 these famous jump 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.910
 so you can see a great design 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 here we find not at all the same 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.730
 color that wizards level 5 of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.100
 power clans that are a little rape and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.219
 rape is a little background it's still 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.350
 it's really a big carnage they are 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.110
 super powerful they are a little bit more 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.440
 resistant than the new 5 beats 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 really it's the power that plays the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 over looked there we can see a little 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 group of wizards this is the darche tower 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 and hal and now she is destroyed 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.500
 in a few seconds you can see 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.970
 that villages like this are so 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 it was max in this es not at all and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 from max base it was a hdv 9 that was 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
 not max and there were good defenses 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.790
 good the ramparts were not great and 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 he had quite correct defenses and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.850
 you can see that that villages 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.299
 are very very easy to destroy with 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 with his troops the doc also I have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 had my king of ys so that helped me a lot 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.259
 at the beginning of the attacked 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.880
 and then especially the socios who did 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.119
 a great job you can see there 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.409
 I still have at least twenty one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.509
 just under a little less than twenty 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 anyway and could see the work 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.590
 they do it's just amazing 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.720
 what passage showers undress 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.869
 I hesitated a little to take them I 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.149
 did not know if it was great 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.360
 good she had heard of course about 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.399
 his jumps and I do not regret at all 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.909
 certainly a bit expensive to pass it to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.040
 level 6 and 7 million chf 3 or 7 million 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.960
 five hundred thousand 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.660
 good it's really the price it's a trick 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.200
 crazy it's a troupe that is super 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.650
 alright here to make Kuwait go away 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.890
 we go vap a full of technique with 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.490
 golem wizard sorcerer walkyrie really 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.820
 very versatile troop stuff 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.360
 with compo can not put compos 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.120
 but with giants it's quiet 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 have a great sailing troop adopt a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.000
 little test of his troops there we had a 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.660
 nice booty anyway a little gift and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.970
 their 250 binic cyr 814 1814 Islam to 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.370
 814 shoots me black and thirty three 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.020
 trophies 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.610
