00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.150
 we all know this kind of people 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.410
 invariably in the top of most hilarious TV moments 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.419
 but how did it finally come so far as stepping on a piece of forest 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.190
 this is a has the exclusive recordings of the then eindhovense band 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.429
 tried to organize there 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.329
 who either 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.199
 he has been guided by what on that what I mean conditionally with one 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.130
 probation on a little experience 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 actually always remember 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.780
 but only about how the bijeaux but 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.690
 to give to the games we do not want to throw away the bath water thereby 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 offer 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
 after a collision 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.290
 that is not true 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.800
 he told how a collision could no longer be avoided 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.810
 what is that at that moment already half a year after the lost final against cercle 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.810
 bruges 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 it can sometimes be longer than expected 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.440
 jajaja became the way to release 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.610
 however, that can be very easy in Antwerp hatch bastaken hatch 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.940
 that turned out to be vain hope because it is better every day 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.590
 that would go i hope he didn't do this 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.810
 after the government informed Tuesday 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.830
 has reached the torque 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.470
 so there is still a few me then but he suggested that I go out there 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 He thinks that a match has fewer but of course it does 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.929
 New York 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.000
 utrecht 7 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.159
 the two got the wk that in my life 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.329
 it strenghtens 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.749
 belga adv it really is just wanting something else 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.749
 I never thought that I didn't get out of the house 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.699
 I really wonder 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.179
 that would be the national debt 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.539
 I fear he has committed suicide 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
 but it is wait what movement itself i will leave 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.069
 I find it annoying that it is being investigated whether this is actually in the 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.089
 earlier 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.849
 was physical
