00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
there like the cost of development to

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.400 
there like the cost of development to
kind<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:28.180> scale<00:03:28.510> everything<00:03:28.750> down<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
kind of like scale everything down and

get it onto the old hardware and stuff

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.550 
get it onto the old hardware and stuff
it's<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.630> gonna<00:03:31.750> cost<00:03:32.020> a<00:03:32.170> bunch<00:03:32.350> because

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
the choice we had to make recently was

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.350 
the choice we had to make recently was
like<00:05:22.290> divekick<00:05:22.710> do<00:05:22.919> we<00:05:23.010> bring<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.700> xbox<00:05:24.090> one

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.050 
like divekick do we bring it to xbox one
and<00:05:24.389> ps4<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:26.580> know<00:05:26.669> that's<00:05:26.820> going<00:05:27.000> to

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
and ps4 and you know that's going to

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.879 
and ps4 and you know that's going to
cost<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.600> have<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.930> time<00:05:28.110> you're<00:05:28.229> like<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.500> think

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
cost you have a time you're like I think

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.140 
cost you have a time you're like I think
well<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.100> this<00:05:29.280> many<00:05:29.520> units<00:05:29.700> and<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.000> think

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
well so this many units and I think

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.909 
well so this many units and I think
it'll<00:05:30.270> cost<00:05:30.419> this<00:05:30.630> much<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:31.020> do<00:05:31.140> it<00:05:31.260> he<00:05:31.680> just

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
it'll cost this much to do it he just

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.350 
it'll cost this much to do it he just
kind<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.280> like<00:05:32.460> make<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.729> best<00:05:32.910> educated

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
kind of like make the best educated

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.450 
kind of like make the best educated
guess<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:33.840> that's<00:05:34.800> how<00:05:34.919> projections

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
guess you can that's how projections

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.060 
guess you can that's how projections
were<00:05:35.640> to<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:36.240> just<00:05:36.419> go<00:05:36.570> I<00:05:36.780> think<00:05:37.770> we'll<00:05:37.890> sell

this<00:05:38.220> much<00:05:38.490> will<00:05:39.000> probably<00:05:39.419> cost<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:39.810> much

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
this much will probably cost this much

that's<00:06:41.040> how<00:06:41.190> when<00:06:41.460> sort<00:06:42.090> of<00:06:42.180> back<00:06:42.330> like<00:06:42.570> in<00:06:42.780> the

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
that's how when sort of back like in the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.440 
that's how when sort of back like in the
PS<00:06:43.230> two<00:06:43.260> days<00:06:43.590> is<00:06:43.860> that<00:06:44.160> the<00:06:45.000> numbers<00:06:45.270> that<00:06:45.300> you

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
PS two days is that the numbers that you

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.960
