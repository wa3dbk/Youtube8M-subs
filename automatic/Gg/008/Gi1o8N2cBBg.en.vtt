00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
that don't make sense the game is canon

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.070 
that don't make sense the game is canon
but<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.700> doesn't<00:02:07.119> take<00:02:07.270> place<00:02:07.509> between<00:02:07.749> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
but it doesn't take place between the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.510 
but it doesn't take place between the
first<00:02:08.110> movie<00:02:08.710> and<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.039> second<00:02:09.399> one

hopefully the game takes place the same
time<00:02:24.519> as<00:02:24.939> the<00:02:25.329> movie<00:02:25.629> storyline<00:02:26.170> instead<00:02:26.799> of

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
time as the movie storyline instead of

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.949 
time as the movie storyline instead of
an<00:02:27.189> actual<00:02:27.430> continuation<00:02:28.359> of<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.689> movie's

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959
