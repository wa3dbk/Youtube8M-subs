00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
functionality the first one we think of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
functionality the first one we think of
as<00:01:00.840> iodine<00:01:01.469> rich<00:01:01.500> foods<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> iodine

as iodine rich foods and iodine

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
as iodine rich foods and iodine
deficiency<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.960> saw<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> rise<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.619> America

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's why we started iodized in our

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
that's why we started iodized in our
salts<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:07.619> seeing<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.010> we're

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
salts we're now seeing if we're

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
salts we're now seeing if we're
encouraging<00:01:09.000> sea<00:01:09.420> vegetables<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> can

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
gonna add that it well we're gonna work

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770 
gonna add that it well we're gonna work
a<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.610> mask<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.540> dish

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
a way to really mask it into this dish

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510 
a way to really mask it into this dish
with<00:01:33.990> lime<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> cumin<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> some<00:01:35.310> bright

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
with lime and cumin and some bright

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.069 
with lime and cumin and some bright
flavors<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.509> won't<00:01:36.630> even<00:01:36.869> taste

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
flavors so you really won't even taste

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
flavors so you really won't even taste
it<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> has<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.100> gelatinous

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it it has a little bit of a gelatinous

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
it it has a little bit of a gelatinous
texture<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.110> also<00:01:40.229> helps<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> lower

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
texture but that also helps to lower

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770 
texture but that also helps to lower
cholesterol<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> anti-inflammatory<00:01:42.630> for

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
cholesterol and be anti-inflammatory for

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
cholesterol and be anti-inflammatory for
the<00:01:42.899> body<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.530> nutrient<00:01:44.070> dense<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.640> when

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the body so very nutrient dense but when

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.069 
the body so very nutrient dense but when
you<00:01:44.850> incorporate<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> powdered<00:01:46.049> form

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you incorporate it in the powdered form

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.940 
you incorporate it in the powdered form
in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> sea<00:01:46.619> salt

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
in the sea salt

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649 
in the sea salt
it<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.399> blended<00:01:47.790> into<00:01:47.909> any<00:01:48.149> savory

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
it can really be blended into any savory

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.350 
it can really be blended into any savory
dish<00:01:48.930> okay<00:01:49.649> well<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.520> iodine<00:01:51.000> helps<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
dish okay well so iodine helps to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.569 
dish okay well so iodine helps to
convert<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> t4<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> active<00:01:52.920> t3<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
convert the t4 to the active t3 which is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
convert the t4 to the active t3 which is
really<00:01:53.909> essential<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.479> thyroid<00:01:54.810> function

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
really essential for thyroid function

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.499 
really essential for thyroid function
then<00:01:55.860> we're<00:01:56.009> looking<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.310> selenium<00:01:56.909> selenium

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
then we're looking at selenium selenium

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
then we're looking at selenium selenium
is<00:01:57.630> an<00:01:57.719> antioxidant<00:01:58.579> Brazil<00:01:59.579> nuts<00:01:59.759> are<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
is an antioxidant Brazil nuts are the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
is an antioxidant Brazil nuts are the
highest<00:02:00.299> source<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.689> selenium<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
highest source of selenium and that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
highest source of selenium and that
helps<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.189> work<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> thyroid<00:02:02.969> function

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
helps to work with the thyroid function

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
helps to work with the thyroid function
we<00:02:04.140> also<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.560> minerals<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.340> we're<00:02:05.490> looking

here quinoa or our rolled oats
gluten-free<00:02:50.900> would<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.530> an<00:02:51.620> emphasis<00:02:51.980> with

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
gluten-free would be an emphasis with

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.410 
gluten-free would be an emphasis with
grains<00:02:52.610> because<00:02:52.880> there's<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.120> strong

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
grains because there's a strong

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.539 
grains because there's a strong
correlation<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:54.170> gluten<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.040> thyroid
