00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.100
 in this chapter 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.270
 we will start the assembly itself 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.409
 and we'll start with installation 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:09.430
 of the motherboard 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.709
 the shear power 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.539
 let's start 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.949
 with the opening of the cabinet 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.169
 usually the cabinet 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.239
 it has its sides 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.109
 your top contribution 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.789
 fix to give 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.789
 four screws 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.539
 removing the screws with a wrench 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.430
 you 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 take cover 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 of the cabinet 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 there are cabinets in which the top 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.070
 will remain 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.650
 and that only the two sides will be removed 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 the cabinet has one of its sides 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.470
 a plate 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.949
 will be fixed 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.990
 the gun a revolver 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.480
 it is fixed 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.550
 with two screws that can also be removed with a wrench 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.620
 you must 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.960
 pull this japa 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.760
 of form 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.460
 contrary 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 the point at which it is attached to the cabinet 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.200
 rolls out 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.600
 so that it stays 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.810
 perpendicular 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 to the cabinet 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.400
 the green fashion fastening plate has wi-fi so we can put the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.480
 screws 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.870
 in several models in order to cut 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.370
 you must 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.350
 placed adding an abortion and found 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.260
 ii mark the attachment points 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.180
 with a pencil or pen for example 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 so that you can get 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.050
 put on 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.720
 plastic clubs 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 burning have a shame of far from the plate 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.300
 the pins for fastening the screws themselves 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.560
 in these points 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.480
 no screws will be attached 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.320
 only 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 a plastic tube 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.759
 to keep distance in tramandaÃ­ boxing 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.509
 and find 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.079
 having been placed the plastic clubs marked places 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.249
 the connectors for fastening the screws 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.579
 hostel 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.639
 know the fashion board 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.919
 first on plastic pins 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.619
 later to find out 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.859
 where you put the clubs 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.249
 the fixing of the screws 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.079
 as in the northeast of the state 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.349
 but still 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.279
 lying perpendicular to the cabinet 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:41.549
 we should do 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 the installation of control lexus 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.299
 control leads will be plugged into a specific part of the motherboard 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.940
 this is only possible 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.719
 with the specification 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:55.840
 that exists 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.589
 in another resident 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.659
 to know exactly 20 pins we will connect 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.929
 what kind of connectors 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.929
 the connectors of the large and the control buttons 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.809
 they will come with your cabinet 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.359
 and will be placed in the psf's following the specification 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.919
 in a fashion change postage 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.710
 so that all buttons work 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.490
 and all genres work 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.739
 properly 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.909
 let's see the specification 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.909
 dalmo according to which we are working 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.439
 the wizard dumbledore bordini is usually very specific about 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.809
 the action position hour by day where the pins are 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.279
 for placement 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.709
 control cables 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.639
 enke pins each of these collectors 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.209
 should be fixed 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.749
 and what it means 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.989
 each of these connectors 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.059
 the cabinets I will not lie offer five types of control connectors 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:56.749
 the broker 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.069
 for control 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.769
 access leading 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.699
 to thank 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.539
 the connector for the operation of the spigot 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.449
 which is the cabinet speaker 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.939
 the connector for the reset button 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.029
 the correct one or connectors that can be individual 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.969
 the lead 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.269
 from paula husfp line 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.740
 the average blackout to know if the microcomputer is connected or 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.279
 off 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.849
 connector pin 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.919
 for the force button the scoreboard 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.030
 which is the power on and off button punishing the computer 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.259
 the position 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.680
 of the plugs also that it is important 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.740
 though 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.270
 the plug is inverted 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.120
 will not cause problems on the same computer 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.120
 just smell the button will stop working 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.439
 this 1 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.650
 that it must be compatible with the opposition of the connector 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.059
 this will enable 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.899
 keiko club is placed on the pins in the correct position
