00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.250
 we've been there for practically less than 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.839
 one thousand meters or approximately one thousand meters 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.939
 from Salgado Filho International Airport 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.710
 we have the airport station of trensurb 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.140
 special to meet 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.930
 however today there is no link 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.850
 from the trensurb directly to the body 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.980
 many users our system for 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.809
 reach the port have to walk on foot is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.730
 have to do stretch on foot 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.379
 this was exactly the problem pointed out 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:54.430
 then a solution is required. 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:56.079
 access to the airport is more economical 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.309
 more efficient more comfortable and more 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.070
 comfortable 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.960
 we extended through the aeromóvel a 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.730
 company's arm to have the body 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.199
 allows a minute and a half 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.490
 make the user see the body 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.490
 be in the system 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.649
 the aeromobile it is a system of 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:20.899
 transport of passengers 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:24.229
 automated system that was developed in 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.469
 Brazil and which has a productive chain 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.849
 100% national 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:34.759
 it is a light vehicle on rails that 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:37.369
 do not have their propulsion on board or 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.149
 be the motor that generates the tensile force 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 system is disembarked from the vehicle 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.610
 outside the vehicle leaving the vehicle 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.500
 The simplest is the lightest possible 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.179
 imagine a sailing boat kept good 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.060
 table up here as the exceeded Venus 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.569
 obama knows she 's weighing his shaft and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.340
 the product is during the event the touch the 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.709
 air inside pulls it pulls with the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.709
 cold wind like you need 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.520
 the occupation of the streets and avenues is it is 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.290
 problem and we know how to use a 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.660
 way I did not see express 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.530
 exclusive form has reached an obstacle to 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.920
 low cost 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.320
 this is what led to his proposal of the new 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.660
 with symptom 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.380
 this project will meet a demand from the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.060
 society which is an access to the airport 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:34.840
 quick and comfortable insurance for 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.850
 public transport this walk she 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.490
 It's really difficult especially it's 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 part of the floor it is not very much 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.450
 Good, then we have to walk with the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.910
 Bad case pulling the wheel no longer works 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.230
 right then it will facilitate a lot 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.230
 when I had new 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.710
 here in the metropolitan area in 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.750
 Porto Alegre is considered a project 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.210
 world cup because it allows 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 a citizen arrives from outside the country outside 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.050
 of our southern state of rio grande 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.750
 Porto Alegre can through the aeromóvel 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.270
 and access road transport from 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.460
 transurb access the center without having to 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.920
 use private vehicle without crossing the module 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.970
 It will be great to be good to us all. 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.610
 huh 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.170
 the gaucho in this one that is a project 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.140
 Gauchos there, right? 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.710
 but what bread and I was happy, not very good 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.760
 in the middle as they are projecting 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.760
 greatly facilitate our 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.690
 the versatility of the system is one of 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.740
 its characteristics is mine to see the most 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.470
 important 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.500
 rather than what to do and reallocations 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.380
 of the overpasses of the constructions 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.610
 around can be inserted the aeromóvel 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:56.250
 by the urban network minimizing to the maximum 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.250
 to life appropriations and reallocations 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:06.010
 all this concept he seeks 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.989
 essentially moving the neighborhood 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.209
 payload with minimum weight 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.269
 monster and this obviously reduces 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.459
 track size or visual interference at 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.790
 pollution between taking care of the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:27.460
 attached to the neck and movement 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:28.960
 the country's first commercial project and 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.660
 application of technology 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.300
 developed here in the region 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.340
 metropolitan of porto alegre that already 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.430
 has been operating for 25 years in 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.430
 Indonesia 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.790
 the system it can say that it is a 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.280
 green technology because the matrix 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.120
 energy is electricity, right? 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:55.090
 and as the energy consumption is low it has 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.820
 a low environmental impact by nature 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.930
 to the favela below has not obstructed the 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.360
 passage of the act 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.250
 so I do not have very general 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.580
 there it is because it does not pass through 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.980
 really donate the world that year 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.310
 happens has no cult hit the vehicle 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.310
 just in time 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.620
 we are concluding this year the project 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.990
 we intend until the middle of the year is in 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.670
 conditions to make it ready and 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.970
 second half we intend this 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.410
 operating system 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:31.480
 The cup will be very important to us. 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.690
 brazilians even to demonstrate 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.920
 for the rest of the world that Brazil 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.030
 develops own solutions 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.790
 intelligent innovators for their 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.270
 problems and that is in strength for the 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.270
 rest of the
