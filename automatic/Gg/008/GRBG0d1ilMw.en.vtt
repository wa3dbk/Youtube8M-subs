00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.700
 helping alberto we will do 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.919
 of the relationships in which I am 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.919
 watching from layton 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.790
 a series of situations and we 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.450
 let's interpret how we would react 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.450
 in that situation 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.210
 reaction number one react to the end 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.210
 of a book does not satisfy you 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:04.150
 little by little the things that I 'm not of 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.369
 close and indignarme life with your father 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.399
 an end that I did not like anything happened 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.170
 the page and usually just wait for one 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:16.930
 more page but this page more are 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.810
 go gogh in white and then over let him 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.780
 aside I'm running to the mobile and I'm looking for 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.509
 someone for later normally 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.509
 always here is trash 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.300
 to a person who says I do not like to read 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 27 to those who do not want to go out in my video 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.010
 Hello 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 goodbye 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.140
 because I do not like it, and suddenly 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.140
 one day he found books I liked a lot 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.700
 you read the book and I said wow but it's a 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 problem because you put yourself in a standard 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.530
 very high and good but it is a way of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.210
 start reading is my pretty girl my sweet 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.570
 Princess 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.460
 Then the clouds when she kisses me 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:36.270
 I feel that it flies higher than the sky 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:38.540
 if your third reaction someone loses your 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.540
 favorite book 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.890
 we lose but in leaving something you take 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.410
 kilos of weight please that is my book 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.150
 favorite he got mega from rain and from 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.670
 sodium has never seen that book again 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.950
 normally unless it's a book 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.150
 which I have given me someone who does 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.880
 I have a lot of love even if it's my book 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.260
 favorite is a material object and if it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.790
 loses then the only thing you would say to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.860
 people who will buy me another book 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.860
 a book has just arrived 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.069
 and destroyed the house of the little boy and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.310
 then well the book I look at what 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.940
 they all appear in bed and we talk 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.709
 everyone to my house does not get books because 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.900
 I live in the middle of nothing living in a 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.000
 field and I have a mailbox then it's me 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 the one that goes to look for the mailbox what I do 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.959
 is to listen to it from the mailbox to download 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.310
 I take the key open light or listen 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.019
 so that when I get home I go 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.940
 opponent debut is to give a story 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.090
 everything is looking and I say to see and when I already 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.390
 I'm going to wear and a fictitious boyfriend is 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.390
 real 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.850
 I am in love with sant of the advantage 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.220
 of being marginalized but not by sam but 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.760
 by water his favorite author publishes 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.760
 a new book 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.090
 min I depend for example when it 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.830
 he said Rowling was going to direct the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.690
 fantastic animal movies and 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.849
 where to find us 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.370
 it can not be 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:16.889
 I want to be able to touch the sky 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.760
 clouds fly and fly as many times says 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.760
 out 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:30.430
 I say a lot and the no way too much 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.199
 and I think he is not identified with 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.599
 except because I do not say anything when I 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.490
 I speak when it is something bad in the plan 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.560
 fuck last choice the guy and the 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.330
 girl are deeply in love without 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.330
 a new one but they do not want to admit it 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.370
 I enjoy 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.980
 let yourself be carried away by the sensations and there 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.250
 are you and I like how you do it 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.250

 We hope you liked it and now a 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:15.550
 toast for health and now a toast for 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.810
 the literature that unites us all except 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.490
