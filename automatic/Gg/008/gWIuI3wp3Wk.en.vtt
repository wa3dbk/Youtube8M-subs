this article that I'm gonna be reading

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.910 
this article that I'm gonna be reading
off<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.929> is<00:01:20.380> uh<00:01:20.770> from<00:01:21.429> June<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.320> 2014<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.679> I'm

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
off is is uh from June of 2014 so I'm

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.980 
off is is uh from June of 2014 so I'm
not<00:01:24.070> sure<00:01:24.130> if<00:01:24.340> these<00:01:24.580> are<00:01:24.820> out<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.330> dates<00:01:25.690> but

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
not sure if these are out of dates but

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.300 
not sure if these are out of dates but
it's<00:01:26.229> only<00:01:26.350> been<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.560> year<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.100> don't

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it's only been a year and so I don't

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.399 
it's only been a year and so I don't
really<00:01:27.399> think<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.789> has<00:01:27.970> been<00:01:28.210> um<00:01:28.539> I<00:01:28.720> could<00:01:29.020> be

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
really think it has been um I could be

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.590 
really think it has been um I could be
wrong<00:01:29.649> but<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.220> think<00:01:30.700> I'm<00:01:30.819> pretty<00:01:31.000> accurate

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
wrong but I I think I'm pretty accurate

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.270 
wrong but I I think I'm pretty accurate
it's<00:01:31.840> it's<00:01:32.080> not<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.560> out<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:32.890> date<00:01:33.069> so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's it's not that out of date so

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's it's not that out of date so
hopefully<00:01:33.729> I'm<00:01:34.000> correct<00:01:34.060> on<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
hopefully I'm correct on that but the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.350 
hopefully I'm correct on that but the
first<00:01:35.170> statistic<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.399> modern<00:01:36.850> warfare<00:01:37.119> 3

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
in the first five days which is just

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.520 
in the first five days which is just
ridiculous<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.659> that's<00:02:07.810> far<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.140> than

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
ridiculous and that's far more than

so<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.500> think<00:02:11.829> that's<00:02:12.070> been<00:02:12.250> beaten<00:02:12.670> I'm<00:02:12.790> pretty

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
so I think that's been beaten I'm pretty

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.849 
so I think that's been beaten I'm pretty
sure<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.299> furious<00:02:13.780> 7<00:02:14.200> has<00:02:14.320> destroyed<00:02:14.680> that

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
sure like furious 7 has destroyed that

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.349 
sure like furious 7 has destroyed that
so<00:02:15.100> that's<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.519> like<00:02:15.730> sure<00:02:15.880> anymore<00:02:16.060> actually

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
so that's not like sure anymore actually

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.759 
so that's not like sure anymore actually
should<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.959> read<00:02:17.109> that<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.440> just<00:02:17.620> an

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
should have read that I just an

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.229 
should have read that I just an
interesting<00:02:18.220> statistic<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.880> its<00:02:19.030> time

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
interesting statistic for its time

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.560 
interesting statistic for its time
another<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:19.900> gamers<00:02:20.410> play<00:02:20.680> almost<00:02:21.570> 2,000

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
another one is gamers play almost 2,000

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.069

years<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:23.290> Call<00:02:23.829> of<00:02:23.859> Duty<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.489> day<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.540> don't

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
years of Call of Duty a day now I don't

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.949 
years of Call of Duty a day now I don't
I<00:02:26.200> find<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.739> very<00:02:26.769> hard<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.579> believe<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:28.720> hard

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
I find it very hard to believe very hard

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.020 
I find it very hard to believe very hard
to<00:02:29.049> believe<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.590> supposedly<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:30.430> true<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
to believe but supposedly it's true the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.810 
to believe but supposedly it's true the
next<00:02:31.359> one<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.750> real<00:02:32.049> cost<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.769> all<00:02:33.190> UAVs

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
next one is the real cost of all UAVs

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.720 
next one is the real cost of all UAVs
destroyed<00:02:34.750> could<00:02:35.079> pay<00:02:35.290> off<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.530> US<00:02:36.040> budget<00:02:36.280> so

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
destroyed could pay off the US budget so

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.659 
destroyed could pay off the US budget so
that's<00:02:37.209> pretty<00:02:37.480> interesting<00:02:37.810> there's<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.669> 813

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
that's pretty interesting there's a 813

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.099 
that's pretty interesting there's a 813

100<00:04:29.530> million<00:04:29.860> that's<00:04:30.070> that's<00:04:30.400> insane<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.180> think

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
100 million that's that's insane I think

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.090 
100 million that's that's insane I think
there's<00:04:31.510> eight<00:04:31.720> billion<00:04:32.080> people<00:04:32.470> on<00:04:32.650> earth<00:04:32.890> ah

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
there's eight billion people on earth ah

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.040 
there's eight billion people on earth ah
so<00:04:33.460> that's<00:04:33.550> just<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:34.180> ratio<00:04:34.330> there<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.870> just

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
so that's just the ratio there is just

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.950 
so that's just the ratio there is just
ridiculous<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.010> says<00:04:36.130> one<00:04:36.430> number<00:04:36.910> one<00:04:37.360> entry
