the<00:00:17.300> benchmarks<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.539> got<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.869> 3d<00:00:19.289> mark<00:00:19.740> as

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the benchmarks that I got on 3d mark as

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.000 
the benchmarks that I got on 3d mark as
well<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.460> quake<00:00:20.910> 3<00:00:21.180> arena<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.769> always

well as quake 3 arena and as always
folks<00:00:23.519> remember<00:00:23.789> these<00:00:24.269> videos<00:00:24.660> are

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
folks remember these videos are

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.650 
folks remember these videos are
completely<00:00:25.560> unedited<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.310> these<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.420> only

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
completely unedited and these are only

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.370 
completely unedited and these are only
my<00:00:27.990> opinions

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.680 

okay<00:00:34.130> what<00:00:34.250> you're<00:00:34.370> looking<00:00:34.610> at<00:00:34.730> here<00:00:34.790> is<00:00:35.240> what

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
okay what you're looking at here is what

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.680 
okay what you're looking at here is what
I<00:00:35.720> have<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.860> overclocked<00:00:37.580> that<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:41.390> memory

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
I have it overclocked that the memory

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.600 
I have it overclocked that the memory
clock<00:00:41.960> is<00:00:42.260> at<00:00:43.390> 370<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.530> core<00:00:46.070> engine

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
clock is at 370 and the core engine

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.160 
clock is at 370 and the core engine
clock<00:00:46.850> is<00:00:47.150> at<00:00:48.310> 225<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.970> with<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:53.600> little

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
clock is at 225 this is with a little

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.170 
clock is at 225 this is with a little
extra<00:00:54.620> cooling<00:00:55.070> which<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:55.640> will<00:00:55.790> show<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.030> in

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
extra cooling which I will show you in

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.680 
extra cooling which I will show you in
one<00:00:56.480> second<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:58.340> this<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.880> not<00:00:59.270> with<00:00:59.540> any

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
one second so this is not with any

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.290 
one second so this is not with any
modifications<00:01:00.530> as<00:01:00.650> such<00:01:00.860> there<00:01:01.220> is<00:01:01.250> no<00:01:01.489> other

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
modifications as such there is no other

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.130 
modifications as such there is no other
heat<00:01:02.690> sinks<00:01:03.100> on<00:01:04.100> either<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.640> memory<00:01:04.970> or<00:01:05.239> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
heat sinks on either the memory or the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.030 
heat sinks on either the memory or the
core<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.930> let's<00:01:09.110> go<00:01:09.260> over<00:01:09.530> now<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:09.860> have<00:01:10.010> a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
core so let's go over now and have a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.680 
core so let's go over now and have a
look<00:01:10.280> inside<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.790> system<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.300> see<00:01:11.509> what<00:01:11.660> I

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
look inside the system and see what I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.930 
look inside the system and see what I
actually<00:01:11.900> did<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.920> run<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.190> stable<00:01:13.610> at<00:01:13.729> this

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
actually did to run it stable at this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:24.030 
actually did to run it stable at this
speed

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.100 

okay<00:01:24.850> if<00:01:24.910> we<00:01:25.030> look<00:01:25.150> in<00:01:25.270> here<00:01:25.480> we'll<00:01:25.660> see<00:01:25.870> that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
okay if we look in here we'll see that

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
okay if we look in here we'll see that
I've<00:01:27.040> made<00:01:27.400> out<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.390> us<00:01:28.510> under<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:28.990> plain<00:01:29.410> old

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I've made out of us under the plain old

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.960 
I've made out of us under the plain old
slock<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.210> saw<00:01:32.880> killer

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.170 

and<00:01:37.240> I've<00:01:37.720> actually<00:01:38.130> mounted<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.490> fan

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
and I've actually mounted it to a fan

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.180 
and I've actually mounted it to a fan
which<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.200> turn<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.650> blowing<00:01:42.130> across<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
which in turn is blowing across the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:53.670 
which in turn is blowing across the
video<00:01:45.190> card<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.710 

as<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:55.040> see<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.550> no<00:01:55.790> modifications

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
as you can see there is no modifications

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.810 
as you can see there is no modifications
to<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.320> CPU<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.580> there's<00:01:59.090> no<00:01:59.240> extra<00:02:00.820> pieces

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
to the CPU and there's no extra pieces

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.300 
to the CPU and there's no extra pieces
on<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:03.500> memory<00:02:03.860> chips<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.830> case<00:02:07.070> is

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
on the memory chips and the case is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.669 
on the memory chips and the case is
closed<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:08.000> an<00:02:08.119> intake<00:02:08.509> at<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.140> bottom<00:02:09.500> and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
closed have an intake at the bottom and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.150 
closed have an intake at the bottom and
exhaust<00:02:10.490> through<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.209> top<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.530> case<00:02:12.770> this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
exhaust through the top of the case this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.680 
exhaust through the top of the case this

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.580 
bigger heard let me now kick out the
card<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.850> have<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:28.970> closer<00:02:29.239> look<00:02:29.540> at<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:32.590> this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
card and have a closer look at it this

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
card and have a closer look at it this
is<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> closer<00:02:34.070> look<00:02:34.280> at<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.860> quick<00:02:37.750> fan<00:02:39.610> which

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
is a closer look at the quick fan which

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.820 
is a closer look at the quick fan which
I<00:02:40.760> use<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.330> blow<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.110> card<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.650> just

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
I use to just blow on the card to just

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.430 
I use to just blow on the card to just
keep<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.730> ensure<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:44.780> cool<00:02:45.050> I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
drill the hole through the card and put

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.960 
drill the hole through the card and put
a<00:02:51.080> rivet<00:02:51.380> through<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:52.370> course<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.760> is

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
a rivet through it of course this is

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.809 
a rivet through it of course this is
just<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:54.110> normal<00:02:55.720> case<00:02:59.049> filler<00:03:00.730> thingy

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
just a normal case filler thingy

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.649
