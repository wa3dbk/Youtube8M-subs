00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
out you can see it in the bin right over

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.350 
out you can see it in the bin right over
there<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.430> you<00:00:19.490> can<00:00:19.670> see<00:00:19.820> it<00:00:19.910> across<00:00:20.090> the

type boards they're not necessarily
motherboards<00:00:29.950> some<00:00:30.950> of<00:00:31.070> them<00:00:31.190> are<00:00:31.280> even

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
motherboards some of them are even

motherboards some of them are even
called<00:00:31.670> labeled<00:00:32.270> as<00:00:32.330> modules<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.110> don't<00:00:33.260> know

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380

little gold little piece in the center
it's<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.649> of<00:01:40.740> cool<00:01:40.920> here's<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.399> backing<00:01:41.820> on

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
it's kind of cool here's the backing on

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.669 
it's kind of cool here's the backing on
it<00:01:41.970> some<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.440> them<00:01:43.530> are

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
it some of them some of them are

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.020 
it some of them some of them are
consistent<00:01:44.160> on<00:01:44.220> both<00:01:44.369> sides<00:01:44.610> some<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.910> them

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
consistent on both sides some of them

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.249 
consistent on both sides some of them
have<00:01:45.240> different<00:01:45.360> designs<00:01:45.840> ah<00:01:47.300> let's<00:01:48.300> see<00:01:48.570> like

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
have different designs ah let's see like

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
have different designs ah let's see like
for<00:01:49.530> instance<00:01:50.210> if<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.300> look<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.539> this<00:01:51.690> guy

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
for instance if you look at this guy

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.290 
for instance if you look at this guy
right<00:01:51.899> here

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
right here

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.890 
right here
you<00:01:53.870> can<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.380> goal<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.600> then<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.690> flip

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
you can see the goal on it then you flip

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.990 
you can see the goal on it then you flip
around<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.290> believe<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:57.830> different<00:01:58.250> yeah<00:01:58.490> see

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
around I believe it's different yeah see

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.270 
around I believe it's different yeah see
how<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.150> square<00:01:59.590> just<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.680> gold<00:02:00.890> square<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
how the square just a gold square on the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.030 
how the square just a gold square on the
side<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.020> flip<00:02:03.200> side<00:02:03.230> it<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.830> looks

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
side on on the flip side it it looks

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.840 
side on on the flip side it it looks
just<00:02:04.190> like<00:02:04.310> this

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
just like this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.700 
just like this
so<00:02:06.850> yeah<00:02:07.850> let's<00:02:08.150> see<00:02:08.270> buddy<00:02:08.510> look<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.410> few

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
so yeah let's see buddy look at a few

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.140 
so yeah let's see buddy look at a few
more<00:02:09.740> here's<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.160> here's<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> red<00:02:10.820> boy<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.030> think

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
more here's a here's a red boy I think

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.390 
more here's a here's a red boy I think
have<00:02:11.300> about<00:02:11.420> six<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.930> these<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.620> as<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.280> can

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
have about six of these and as you can

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.070 
have about six of these and as you can
see<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.820> doesn't<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.630> know<00:02:14.720> even

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
see it it doesn't you know even

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.480 
see it it doesn't you know even
something<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.530> doesn't<00:02:15.860> look<00:02:16.220> like

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
something like this doesn't look like

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.820 
something like this doesn't look like
much<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.320> at<00:02:18.440> these<00:02:18.560> little

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
much but if you look at these little

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.730 
much but if you look at these little
pegs<00:02:19.100> right<00:02:19.430> here<00:02:20.080> these<00:02:21.080> boards<00:02:21.530> they're

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
pegs right here these boards they're

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.670 
pegs right here these boards they're
layered<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.750> gold<00:02:23.960> that<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.350> for

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
layered and the gold that like for

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.810 
layered and the gold that like for
instance<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.100> these<00:02:25.250> little<00:02:25.460> holes<00:02:25.640> right

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
instance on these little holes right

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.120 
instance on these little holes right
here<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.210> encapsulate<00:02:26.840> them<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.680> follows

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
here that encapsulate them it follows

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.530 
here that encapsulate them it follows
all<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.550> way<00:02:28.640> through<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:31.540> again

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
all the way through so it's like again

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.080 
all the way through so it's like again
I'm<00:02:32.660> really<00:02:33.050> at<00:02:33.170> odds<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.620> don't<00:02:33.680> know

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
I'm really at odds and I don't know

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.400 
I'm really at odds and I don't know
really<00:02:35.090> exactly<00:02:35.480> what<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.780> stuff<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.260> but

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
really exactly what the stuff is but

where the pins go if you look more at

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.520 
where the pins go if you look more at
something<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.100> mean<00:04:32.260> that<00:04:33.260> looks

and all the way up this has to be about

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.620 
and all the way up this has to be about
let's<00:05:31.530> see<00:05:31.620> here<00:05:31.800> one<00:05:31.980> two<00:05:32.030> three<00:05:33.030> four<00:05:33.360> five

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
let's see here one two three four five

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.610 
let's see here one two three four five
six<00:05:33.870> seven<00:05:34.050> eight<00:05:34.260> nine<00:05:35.420> two<00:05:36.420> four<00:05:36.810> six<00:05:37.080> eight

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
six seven eight nine two four six eight

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.430 
six seven eight nine two four six eight
so<00:05:37.920> about<00:05:38.040> sixteen<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.640> these<00:05:38.960> squares<00:05:39.960> of

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
so about sixteen of these squares of

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.120 
so about sixteen of these squares of
gold<00:05:41.450> plating<00:05:42.450> on<00:05:42.810> it<00:05:42.870> plus<00:05:43.440> once<00:05:43.770> again<00:05:44.010> you

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
gold plating on it plus once again you

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.100 
gold plating on it plus once again you
have<00:05:44.160> these<00:05:44.370> little<00:05:44.630> these<00:05:45.630> little<00:05:45.690> pieces

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
have these little these little pieces

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.330 
have these little these little pieces
right<00:05:46.200> here<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.710> think<00:05:46.890> that<00:05:47.010> go<00:05:47.100> all<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.250> way

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
right here I think that go all the way

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.210 
right here I think that go all the way
through<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.730> they<00:05:47.790> also<00:05:47.970> have<00:05:48.240> these<00:05:49.220> again

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
through and they also have these again

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.930 
through and they also have these again
these<00:05:51.260> you<00:05:52.260> can<00:05:52.410> see<00:05:52.560> here<00:05:52.770> this<00:05:53.520> stuff<00:05:53.760> is

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
these you can see here this stuff is

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.660 
these you can see here this stuff is
layered<00:05:54.240> again<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.140> this<00:05:55.830> gold<00:05:56.190> plating<00:05:56.580> is

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
layered again and this gold plating is

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.610 
layered again and this gold plating is
going<00:05:56.910> all<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.060> way<00:05:57.150> through<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:57.870> so<00:05:58.290> I

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
going all the way through that so I

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.560 
going all the way through that so I
don't<00:05:59.370> know<00:05:59.490> how<00:05:59.670> much<00:05:59.790> is<00:05:59.940> within<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.360> layers

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
don't know how much is within the layers

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.980 
don't know how much is within the layers
but<00:06:01.160> it's<00:06:02.160> pretty<00:06:02.490> it<00:06:03.420> looks<00:06:03.660> really

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
but it's pretty it looks really

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.360 
but it's pretty it looks really
promising<00:06:04.200> it<00:06:04.560> looks<00:06:04.710> really<00:06:04.950> cool<00:06:05.100> if<00:06:05.250> you

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
promising it looks really cool if you

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.710 
promising it looks really cool if you
know<00:06:05.490> what<00:06:05.640> this<00:06:05.790> stuff<00:06:06.000> is<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.450> you<00:06:06.510> know<00:06:06.660> you

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
know what this stuff is and you know you

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.140 
know what this stuff is and you know you
know<00:06:06.900> what<00:06:07.050> you<00:06:07.170> can<00:06:07.320> get<00:06:07.470> it<00:06:07.560> for<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:09.000> you'll

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
know what you can get it for and you'll

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.140 
know what you can get it for and you'll
be<00:06:09.360> pretty<00:06:09.540> much<00:06:09.750> all<00:06:09.930> set<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.260> go

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
be pretty much all set to go
