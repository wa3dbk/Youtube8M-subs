00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
another day of a super glue and by now

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.140 
another day of a super glue and by now
the<00:03:52.239> super<00:03:52.750> glue<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:54.610> mono<00:03:54.849> is

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the super glue on the the mono is

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.870 
the super glue on the the mono is
starting<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.569> firm<00:03:55.810> up<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.370> what<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.640> want<00:03:57.819> to

do is you want take a little bit of time

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.490 
do is you want take a little bit of time
pull<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.090> nice<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> tight<00:04:01.510> hold<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
pull it nice and tight hold it in the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.990 
pull it nice and tight hold it in the
position<00:04:02.950> where<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.280> going<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.519> protect<00:04:03.819> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
position where it's going to protect the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.050 
position where it's going to protect the
hook<00:04:04.930> point<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.440> then<00:04:06.280> wait<00:04:06.579> for<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:06.970> dry

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
hook point and then wait for it to dry

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.759 
hook point and then wait for it to dry
I'm<00:04:07.690> going<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.930> go<00:04:08.019> ahead<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.170> kill<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.530> video

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
I'm going to go ahead and kill the video

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.259 
I'm going to go ahead and kill the video
because<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.160> will<00:04:09.250> take<00:04:09.430> about<00:04:09.640> two<00:04:10.150> or

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
because this will take about two or

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.160 
because this will take about two or
three<00:04:10.450> minutes<00:04:12.239> ok<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.599> super<00:04:13.900> glue<00:04:14.049> is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
three minutes ok so the super glue is

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.140 
three minutes ok so the super glue is
pretty<00:04:14.920> well<00:04:15.069> firmed<00:04:15.370> up<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.819> now<00:04:15.910> what<00:04:16.060> you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
pretty well firmed up and now what you

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.129 
pretty well firmed up and now what you
want<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.329> do<00:04:16.450> is<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.600> want<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.840> take<00:04:16.989> that

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
want to do is you want to take that

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.969 
want to do is you want to take that
model<00:04:17.380> bend<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:17.919> back<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:19.299> it's<00:04:19.979> just

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
model bend it back so that it's just

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.689 
model bend it back so that it's just
about<00:04:21.220> touching<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.700> hook<00:04:22.330> point<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.699> you

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
about touching the hook point and you

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.360 
about touching the hook point and you
want<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.970> cut<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:26.310> extends<00:04:27.310> past<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.729> point

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
want to cut it so extends past the point

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.250 
want to cut it so extends past the point
you<00:04:30.370> can<00:04:30.550> imagine<00:04:30.729> let's<00:04:31.450> move<00:04:31.660> it<00:04:31.810> along<00:04:31.840> and

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
you can imagine let's move it along and

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.950 
you can imagine let's move it along and
it<00:04:32.350> runs<00:04:32.650> into<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.979> stick<00:04:33.310> or<00:04:33.430> something<00:04:33.960> it's

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
it runs into a stick or something it's

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.300 
it runs into a stick or something it's
got<00:04:35.139> to<00:04:35.229> deflect<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.919> way<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.070> there

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
got to deflect all the way to there

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.450 
got to deflect all the way to there
before<00:04:37.080> you'll<00:04:38.080> snag<00:04:38.350> up<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.010> it's<00:04:39.280> pretty

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
before you'll snag up so it's pretty

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.020 
before you'll snag up so it's pretty
effective<00:04:40.590> now<00:04:41.590> remember<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> chenille<00:04:42.880> I

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
effective now remember the chenille I

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.440 
effective now remember the chenille I
tied<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.479> earlier<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.130> get<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.310> out<00:04:45.550> go

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
tied in earlier and get that out go

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.409 
tied in earlier and get that out go
ahead<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.660> wrap<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:46.930> forward<00:04:51.030> it's<00:04:52.030> really

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
ahead and wrap that forward it's really

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.570 
ahead and wrap that forward it's really
just<00:04:52.570> kind<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.870> adds<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.260> color<00:04:53.580> don't

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
just kind of adds to the color don't

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.540 
just kind of adds to the color don't
think<00:04:54.849> it<00:04:54.970> does<00:04:55.270> too<00:04:55.599> much<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:56.370> make<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.490> a

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
think it does too much to make it a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.350 
think it does too much to make it a
better<00:04:57.669> full<00:04:58.000> fly<00:04:59.520> does<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.700> make<00:05:00.849> me<00:05:01.030> happy

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
better full fly does it make me happy

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:13.790 
better full fly does it make me happy
with<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.630> way<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.750> turns<00:05:02.110> out<00:05:02.260> looking
