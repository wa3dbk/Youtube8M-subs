00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it's Crillon um and yeah I've got a lot

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
it's Crillon um and yeah I've got a lot
of<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> guys<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.290> never<00:00:43.500> seen<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> Crillon

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
of you guys have never seen this Crillon

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.069 
of you guys have never seen this Crillon
before<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.110> see<00:00:47.809> that's<00:00:48.809> why<00:00:48.989> I'm

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
before you know you see that's why I'm

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.540 
before you know you see that's why I'm
saying<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.739> interesting<00:00:50.309> figure

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
saying it's a very interesting figure

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.450 
saying it's a very interesting figure
because<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.629> guess<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.680> somewhat<00:00:53.129> hard<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
because I guess it's somewhat hard to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.619 
because I guess it's somewhat hard to
find<00:00:55.280> yeah<00:00:56.280> let<00:00:56.699> me<00:00:56.730> tell<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.510> bit

find yeah let me tell you a little bit

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
find yeah let me tell you a little bit
about<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> figure<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.129> by<00:00:59.520> Irwin<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
about the figure it's not by Irwin it's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.380 
about the figure it's not by Irwin it's
solved<00:01:00.719> by<00:01:00.840> Bandai<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.010> by<00:01:02.390> Jack's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
solved by Bandai it's not by Jack's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
solved by Bandai it's not by Jack's
either<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:06.439> I<00:01:07.439> guess<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> can

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
either it's actually a I guess you can

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.420 
either it's actually a I guess you can
say<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> kid's<00:01:09.030> meal<00:01:09.299> figure<00:01:09.840> yeah<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.400> be

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
say a kid's meal figure yeah to be

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
say a kid's meal figure yeah to be
honest<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
honest it actually is and I think it's a

really good I think it's really good
size<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.600> compared<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.050> all<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.260> other<00:02:56.440> figures

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
size I compared to all the other figures

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.420 
size I compared to all the other figures
and<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.450> good<00:02:58.600> skill<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.140> the<00:03:00.100> fingers

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and it's a good skill and the fingers

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.180 
and it's a good skill and the fingers
were<00:03:00.700> actually<00:03:01.210> actually<00:03:02.200> pretty<00:03:02.650> well<00:03:02.890> done

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
were actually actually pretty well done

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.820 
were actually actually pretty well done
um<00:03:03.910> she's<00:03:04.360> expression<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.350> they<00:03:05.470> actually

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
um she's expression and they actually

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.210 
um she's expression and they actually
didn't<00:03:06.130> color<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.240> eyes<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.410> it's

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
didn't color the eyes and it's like it's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.150 
didn't color the eyes and it's like it's
not<00:03:09.310> quite<00:03:09.460> in<00:03:09.700> white<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:11.140> know<00:03:11.260> as<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.710> like

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
not quite in white you know as in like

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920 
not quite in white you know as in like
that's<00:03:12.340> how<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:12.670> supposed<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.330> he<00:03:13.660> has<00:03:13.780> no

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
that's how it's supposed to be he has no

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.870 
that's how it's supposed to be he has no
color<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.770> like<00:03:14.950> skin<00:03:15.130> color<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.730> know

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
color it's just like skin color you know

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.500 
color it's just like skin color you know
and<00:03:16.260> um<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.130> that's<00:03:18.310> big<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.030> right<00:03:19.270> and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and um so that's big is that right and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.210 
and um so that's big is that right and
then<00:03:19.690> there<00:03:19.930> there<00:03:20.440> are<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> dots<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.100> his

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
then there there are the dots on his

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.860 
then there there are the dots on his
head<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.270> see<00:03:22.300> if<00:03:22.540> there<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:22.810> like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
head you can see if there it's like

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.920 
head you can see if there it's like
molded<00:03:23.260> inside<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:25.360> know<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.510> just<00:03:25.600> think

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
molded inside and you know I just think

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.750 
molded inside and you know I just think
the<00:03:26.050> expression<00:03:26.380> isn't<00:03:26.740> bad<00:03:27.010> either<00:03:27.040> sort<00:03:27.700> of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the expression isn't bad either sort of

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
the expression isn't bad either sort of
eye<00:03:27.880> expression

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
eye expression

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.020 
eye expression
I<00:03:28.980> don't<00:03:29.980> know<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.070> just<00:03:30.190> think<00:03:30.580> it's<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.820> pretty

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
I don't know I just think it's a pretty

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.610 
I don't know I just think it's a pretty
good<00:03:31.120> figure<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.570> mean<00:03:31.780> especially<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.200> kids

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
good figure I mean especially for kids

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.020 
good figure I mean especially for kids
no<00:03:32.830> one<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:35.370> he's<00:03:36.370> actually<00:03:37.170> um<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:39.700> it's<00:03:39.880> not

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
no one and he's actually um he it's not

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.440 
no one and he's actually um he it's not
like<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.210> complete<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.870> um<00:03:41.520> it's<00:03:42.520> Hollow<00:03:43.060> of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
like a complete like um it's Hollow of

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.300 
like a complete like um it's Hollow of
something<00:03:44.050> it's<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.650> hollow<00:03:44.860> figure

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
something it's a hollow figure

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.270 
something it's a hollow figure
everything<00:03:46.210> in<00:03:46.810> here<00:03:46.990> that<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.890> Hollow

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
everything in here that it's Hollow

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.420 
everything in here that it's Hollow
and<00:03:48.490> also<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.510> can<00:03:49.750> tell<00:03:49.990> because<00:03:50.500> um<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.250> has
