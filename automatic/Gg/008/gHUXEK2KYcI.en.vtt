 would melt be shaken 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.950
 brain 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.990
 watched a video of various American 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.550
 bloggers like what's in my 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.710
 the fridge is like that 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.770

 fried different like pizza that 's all 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.960
