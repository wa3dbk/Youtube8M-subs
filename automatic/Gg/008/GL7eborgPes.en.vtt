00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.780
 the precious one out of three brief you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.680
 have already seen it in a hall if I ever 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 you find the video you put it there 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.380
 for home which is at the level of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.530
 cheeks I made a little mixture so 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.790
 with those so from birth 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.830
 here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.660
 racialized powder so I put these 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.720
 colors 6 and this one so that makes 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.920
 like that that's it it's aimed I would like 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.780
 eat a little bit of everything and I have 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.190
 put on the back of my cheekbones and on 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 the days to have a little effect a 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.450
 little water yes and then I put my 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.300
 blush of checchi that a little redhead 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 105 that's this here so I can 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.580
 know about my cheeks at the level of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.380
 lips we could lips I got my 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.630
 red angel students from that my clinic 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.270
 and like this because you know 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.580
 hungry so here and water nude enough 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.660
 finally that I like m when I seek 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.220
 a little eyes so today I had 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.420
 a little bit loaded and goes above 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.119
 I put a gloss of home that cause 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.830
 So this is this one here I think 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.380
 this is the reference 12 when I spend a 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.160
 sauce at the reference I put all bongo 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.239
 so this one goes above to 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.550
 give a slightly brighter effect 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.320
 then we will move on to holding 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.750
 she herself at the level of jewelry brief 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.489
 at the level of visions so I put my 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.700
 pearl earrings feet like that all 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.110
 simple I have nothing special otherwise 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.980
 at the waves I have nothing at all 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.820
 since it's been a while since I 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 pars woman manicure 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.420
 so let's move on to the level of 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.530
 up so its waters like this so who 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.420
 come to pink that 's not it 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 of air you can finally find the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.660
 holding that I'm wearing there it will be I you in 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.820
 make a hall because these brakes that I have 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.380
 bought not so long ago which m 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.630
 and the video here when you catch poster 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.510
 must you know the prices etc and 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.570
 you find them from the so a bone like 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.400
 so that is white with so 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.640
 small golden patterns like that beats so 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.190
 sleeve return a little here here is 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.549
 so it's all because it makes 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.590
 the cut a little further behind and 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:18.360
 otherwise he has the little detail of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.370
 attracting gold here that's why I 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.709
 find super nice it's a long 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 moment we have it in store and there 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.160
 only that finally I tell myself that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.690
 I'll buy it whatever I try it 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.650
 etc. 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.470
 that's what I eat well I wear 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.700
 dark enough things turns his 7th and the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.560
 bomb there the end of the summer I put myself to 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.239
 to wear things a little bit more 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.630
 more live a little lighter it's not 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 serious 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.870
 that's it then, so see 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.299
 trousers 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.200
 so if my camera will hold me back an age 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.590
 accurate you will see I may be going to me 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.880
 back down so here is a tregging 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.459
 so in jeans 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.169
 What then finally their jeans like the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.790
 researcher who is not it so that's it 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.650
 so that geyser all the colors that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.160
 now you will see that 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.780
 shortly 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.280
 that's how it is so it's a 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.389
 tregging really very close to the body 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.700
 here and so I rolled down 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.900
 that's because I find to be so the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.299
 sandals be it better 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.579
 I think it makes me look a little 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.049
 summer like this so it's bad sound 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.790
 to be from bershka 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.400
 separate you have managed train today 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.770
 if I here you are then that they are 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.639
 here we are 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.639
 and so here's for the outfit 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.490
 and so to go out there there ya ya 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.140
 sun this fare is not too cold have me 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.730
 still a little bit and then when I 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.410
 come back in the evening in case 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.960
 and so I wanted to put on a jacket so 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.160
 I took my little blazer or whatever 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.720
 I had bought at new look suddenly 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.700
 I had already seen since in fact he has the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 little golden buttons so it reminds a 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.880
 little bit holding the water and the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.680
 sandalettes and so these are the 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.660
 3/4 sleeve that of bruce and I find 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.870
 really cover a little bit that's all for 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:07.580
 not have too little cold or what so 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:10.100
 that's how that will learn so for 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.560
 my little outfit of the day so I hope 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.790

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.290
 I will try to remake a little more 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.970
 often it's true that I do not think about it 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.010
 necessarily 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.480

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.220
 time but I will try to get there 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.330
