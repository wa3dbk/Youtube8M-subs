00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello everyone after the photo shoot soda 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.309
 the photographer you have in many question 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.429
 what kind of platinum really isn't 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.769
 pays a piece of cloth 140 wide 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 centimeters and a length of 3 meters to me he 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.500
 3 meter ramp to be 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.590
 six but in principle such a length 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.970
 I can not take even I have this 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 a strip of 12 centimeters width how many 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.340
 you will need it all depends on 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.270
 your for is a skin substitute and another 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 here is such 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 polosochka thin which keeps here 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:46.710
 this strip but if you have wide 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 The belt is also suitable for this one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 a piece of centimeters my past 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.430
 and tie 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.420
 either belt or 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.420
 I wrap such a wide stripe 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 can of course be done in principle very 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.540
 can not beautifully cause the belt can and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.369
 stir up sew but so simple 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 an option that is done very quickly and 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.700
 fit in principle now starting to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.300
 design 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.910
 your dress by the time and by the way 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.170
 forgot to say absolutely what is necessary 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.170
 need sin 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:48.990
 without ticks because it is we who are 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:52.710
 these edges will be to create and shape 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.460
 on what upper part therefore necessarily 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.170
 need and preferably some 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.320
 form of a corset on any 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.320
 very barren basis 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.060
 principle for registration here 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.560
 I need someone to give and because 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:19.550
 what is a lot of options my option 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:24.890
 was originally such a world on this 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.590
 and here to do it 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.970
 Dress for the exit is not for photo shoots 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.420
 need to process it handle the edges and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:42.890
 You can basically do it more or 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.600
 less somewhere somewhere do tuck then 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.730
 there will need to work on it and 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.220
 if there are any sewing skills 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.190
 it is very easy to do so. 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.960
 to make it just a water session in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.590
 principle here is one option i think 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.590
 good fit everyone thank you all bye
