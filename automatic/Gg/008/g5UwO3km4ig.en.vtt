to tentacruel just to hopefully make him
switch<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.100> scare<00:00:56.549> him<00:00:56.699> away<00:00:56.900> so<00:00:57.900> i<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.080> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
switch and scare him away so i do that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.039 
switch and scare him away so i do that
and<00:00:58.769> he<00:00:58.949> hits<00:00:59.129> me<00:00:59.220> with<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> great<00:00:59.940> move<00:01:00.049> HP

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
and he hits me with a great move HP

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.380 
and he hits me with a great move HP
electric<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.040> was<00:01:02.159> really<00:01:02.190> good<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.970> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
electric so that was really good and it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.850 
electric so that was really good and it
did<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> lot<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.260> probably<00:01:04.500> made<00:01:04.710> him<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
did a lot so it probably made him a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.789 
did a lot so it probably made him a
little<00:01:05.070> curious<00:01:05.570> but<00:01:06.570> whatever<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.650> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
little curious but whatever because this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850 
little curious but whatever because this
is<00:01:07.950> obviously<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> wall<00:01:09.060> tentacruel<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> i

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
is obviously not a wall tentacruel so i

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
is obviously not a wall tentacruel so i
switched<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.490> he<00:01:11.549> also<00:01:11.850> didn't<00:01:12.180> see

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
switched out now he also didn't see

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670 
switched out now he also didn't see
leftovers<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.080> i'm<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.590> he

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
leftovers which i'm not sure if he

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
leftovers which i'm not sure if he
registered<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> i<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:15.359> to<00:01:15.420> this

ARF<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.520> should<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.820> paid<00:02:24.030> better

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
ARF and I should have paid better

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.270 
ARF and I should have paid better
attention<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.200> knew<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:26.010> didn't

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
attention to that I knew I just didn't

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
attention to that I knew I just didn't
didn't<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.940> don't<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.510> forgot<00:02:27.930> about<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.170> later<00:02:28.380> i

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
didn't I don't I forgot about it later i

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.460 
didn't I don't I forgot about it later i
guess<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.400> i<00:02:29.490> put<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.850> sleep<00:02:30.060> again

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.830 
guess and i put it to sleep again
unfortunately<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:31.620> comes<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.010> thing<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
unfortunately here comes this thing I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.930 
unfortunately here comes this thing I
thought<00:02:33.840> about<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.470> would<00:02:35.070> switch<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
thought about it would switch and I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.980 
thought about it would switch and I
should<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.240> put<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.600> sleep<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:36.960> well

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
should have put that to sleep as well

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.410 
should have put that to sleep as well
but<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.320> didn't<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.160> man<00:02:38.700> whatever<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.210> just

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800

don't know that was that was huge so I'm

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.240 
don't know that was that was huge so I'm
able<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.480> Cael<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.140> now<00:03:34.860> he<00:03:34.920> brings

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
able to to it Cael it and now he brings

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.740 
able to to it Cael it and now he brings
I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.700> he<00:03:35.760> brings<00:03:35.880> his<00:03:36.060> apt<00:03:36.269> was<00:03:36.450> right<00:03:36.570> back

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
I think he brings his apt was right back

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
I think he brings his apt was right back
again<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.590> don't<00:03:37.739> know<00:03:37.800> what<00:03:38.040> he<00:03:38.130> was

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
again so I don't know what he was

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.740 
again so I don't know what he was
thinking<00:03:38.280> because<00:03:38.580> if<00:03:38.760> he<00:03:38.880> kept<00:03:39.090> roosting<00:03:39.600> up

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
thinking because if he kept roosting up

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.100 
thinking because if he kept roosting up
man<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.920> should<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.670> ich<00:03:41.850> you'd<00:03:42.150> hear<00:03:42.570> but<00:03:43.080> I

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
man I should have ich you'd hear but I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.390 
man I should have ich you'd hear but I
didn't<00:03:43.530> because<00:03:43.620> at<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:43.980> point<00:03:44.070> he's<00:03:44.370> still

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
didn't because at this point he's still

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.160 
didn't because at this point he's still
probably<00:03:44.820> could<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.120> peepee<00:03:45.630> stalled<00:03:45.989> me

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
probably could have peepee stalled me

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.550 
probably could have peepee stalled me
with<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> pressure<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.209> roost<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:49.290> I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
with the pressure and roost and so I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770 
with the pressure and roost and so I
really<00:03:49.920> should<00:03:50.070> have<00:03:50.190> used<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> eq<00:03:50.700> but<00:03:51.090> yeah

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
really should have used the eq but yeah

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.320 
really should have used the eq but yeah
I<00:03:52.019> guess<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.470> figured<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.950> secrecy<00:03:53.910> would<00:03:54.180> be

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
I guess I figured the secrecy would be

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.050 
I guess I figured the secrecy would be
more<00:03:54.540> important<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.620> Brick<00:03:56.430> Break<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.850> finish

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
more important so Brick Break can finish

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.330 
more important so Brick Break can finish
that<00:03:57.239> off<00:03:57.390> which<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.720> nice<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.769> now<00:03:58.920> his<00:03:59.100> walls

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
that off which is nice so now his walls

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.090 
that off which is nice so now his walls
are<00:03:59.550> getting<00:03:59.850> down<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.209> real<00:04:00.420> quick<00:04:01.100> brings

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
are getting down there real quick brings

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.330 
are getting down there real quick brings
in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> bird<00:04:02.519> again<00:04:02.820> takes<00:04:03.209> more<00:04:03.420> SR<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.340> this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
in the bird again takes more SR and this

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.370 
in the bird again takes more SR and this
is<00:04:05.550> probably<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.330> only<00:04:06.510> time<00:04:06.660> when<00:04:07.170> cross

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
is probably the only time when cross

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.960 
is probably the only time when cross
chop<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.800> going<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:07.980> be<00:04:08.040> more<00:04:08.160> beneficial<00:04:08.340> over

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
chop is going to be more beneficial over

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.670 
chop is going to be more beneficial over
brick<00:04:09.180> break<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.840> just<00:04:10.200> can't<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.560> it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
brick break but I just can't have it

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.090 
brick break but I just can't have it
missing<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.540> t-bolts<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.750> he<00:04:13.560> gets<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.800> crit

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
missing so t-bolts and he gets the crit

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.280 
missing so t-bolts and he gets the crit
I<00:04:14.310> was<00:04:14.700> hoping<00:04:14.910> for<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.120> crit<00:04:15.300> myself<00:04:15.660> but<00:04:16.080> I

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
I was hoping for a crit myself but I

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.750 
I was hoping for a crit myself but I
have<00:04:16.560> sash<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.160> doesn't<00:04:17.370> matter<00:04:17.430> too<00:04:17.729> much

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
have sash so it doesn't matter too much

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.490 
have sash so it doesn't matter too much
like<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.419> mean<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.630> guess<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:18.900> kind<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.140> huge<00:04:19.380> it

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
like I mean I guess it's kind of huge it

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.430 
like I mean I guess it's kind of huge it
keeps<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:19.830> alive<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.720> I'm<00:04:21.720> able<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.140> finish<00:04:22.320> it

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
keeps me alive but I'm able to finish it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.370 
keeps me alive but I'm able to finish it
off<00:04:22.910> thankfully<00:04:23.910> finish<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.450> off<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.900> then

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
off thankfully finish it off and then

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.620 
off thankfully finish it off and then
I'm<00:04:25.500> thinking<00:04:25.890> well<00:04:26.040> his<00:04:26.669> three<00:04:27.060> walls<00:04:27.360> are

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
I'm thinking well his three walls are

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.050 
I'm thinking well his three walls are
gone<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.260> can't<00:04:28.740> sucker<00:04:28.950> punch<00:04:29.250> his<00:04:29.430> his<00:04:29.580> elf<00:04:29.820> I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
gone I can't sucker punch his his elf I

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.610 
gone I can't sucker punch his his elf I
don't<00:04:30.390> know<00:04:30.540> what<00:04:30.720> else<00:04:30.750> he's<00:04:31.050> got<00:04:31.080> but<00:04:31.560> I

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
don't know what else he's got but I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.679 
don't know what else he's got but I
should<00:04:31.830> be<00:04:31.919> straight<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.400> can't<00:04:32.580> believe<00:04:32.910> this

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:33.689 
should be straight I can't believe this

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.359 
should be straight I can't believe this
this<00:04:33.929> isn't<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.289> real<00:04:34.439> team<00:04:34.709> I'm<00:04:34.830> not<00:04:34.979> supposed

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:35.369 
this isn't a real team I'm not supposed

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:38.659 
this isn't a real team I'm not supposed
to<00:04:35.580> win<00:04:35.789> this<00:04:35.969> it<00:04:36.599> was<00:04:36.719> funny<00:04:36.989> as<00:04:37.169> hell<00:04:37.339> so<00:04:38.339> in

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
to win this it was funny as hell so in

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.459 
to win this it was funny as hell so in
comes<00:04:38.999> the<00:04:39.179> shelf<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.719> I<00:04:39.809> just<00:04:40.019> go<00:04:40.169> right<00:04:40.379> with

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
comes the shelf and I just go right with

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.619 
comes the shelf and I just go right with
that<00:04:40.529> and<00:04:40.799> sucker<00:04:40.979> punch<00:04:41.309> it<00:04:41.519> I<00:04:41.699> was<00:04:42.119> I<00:04:42.269> wasn't

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
that and sucker punch it I was I wasn't

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.179 
that and sucker punch it I was I wasn't
sure<00:04:42.839> if<00:04:42.989> it<00:04:43.079> would<00:04:43.199> work<00:04:43.259> on<00:04:43.559> you<00:04:43.619> term<00:04:43.979> but<00:04:44.159> I

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
sure if it would work on you term but I

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:45.350 
sure if it would work on you term but I
was<00:04:44.309> I<00:04:44.369> don't<00:04:44.519> see<00:04:44.669> why<00:04:44.789> not<00:04:44.819> it's<00:04:45.059> a<00:04:45.119> direct

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
was I don't see why not it's a direct

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.929 
was I don't see why not it's a direct
attack<00:04:45.569> so<00:04:46.229> I<00:04:46.529> couldn't<00:04:47.219> believe<00:04:47.339> is<00:04:47.519> I<00:04:47.669> see<00:04:47.819> an

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
attack so I couldn't believe is I see an

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.899 
attack so I couldn't believe is I see an
ape<00:04:48.119> I<00:04:48.449> was<00:04:48.899> thinking<00:04:49.199> sash<00:04:49.469> or<00:04:49.739> mock<00:04:49.949> punch<00:04:50.279> so

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
ape I was thinking sash or mock punch so

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.819 
ape I was thinking sash or mock punch so
I<00:04:50.969> probably<00:04:51.749> should<00:04:52.139> have<00:04:52.169> sucker-punched

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:52.829 
I probably should have sucker-punched

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:54.350 
I probably should have sucker-punched
here<00:04:52.979> just<00:04:53.159> to<00:04:53.249> make<00:04:53.399> sure<00:04:53.429> but<00:04:53.999> I<00:04:54.029> figure

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
here just to make sure but I figure

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.909 
here just to make sure but I figure
doesn't<00:04:54.629> matter<00:04:54.929> I've<00:04:55.139> got<00:04:55.289> other<00:04:55.409> guys<00:04:55.499> at

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
doesn't matter I've got other guys at

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.899 
doesn't matter I've got other guys at
this<00:04:56.069> point<00:04:56.339> so<00:04:57.239> i<00:04:57.619> was<00:04:58.619> able<00:04:58.709> just<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.009> move

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
this point so i was able just to move

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.159 
this point so i was able just to move
right<00:05:00.089> along<00:05:00.239> and<00:05:00.539> i<00:05:00.569> couldn't<00:05:00.929> believe<00:05:00.989> that

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
right along and i couldn't believe that

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.899 
right along and i couldn't believe that
I<00:05:01.319> got<00:05:01.589> him<00:05:01.709> with<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:01.889> team<00:05:02.429> that<00:05:02.459> wasn't

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
I got him with a team that wasn't
