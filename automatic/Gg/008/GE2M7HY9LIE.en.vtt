00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
what matters 15 milliseconds so now

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.250

is<00:03:30.910> what<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.090> would<00:03:31.239> get<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.630> 349<00:03:32.440> milliseconds

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
is what I would get so 349 milliseconds

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.280 
is what I would get so 349 milliseconds
in<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.549> ping<00:03:33.760> see<00:03:34.299> how<00:03:34.450> it's<00:03:34.570> already<00:03:34.900> gone<00:03:35.049> up

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
in the ping see how it's already gone up

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.120 
in the ping see how it's already gone up
but<00:03:35.920> my<00:03:36.070> download<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.910> gonna<00:03:37.870> go<00:03:38.079> crazy<00:03:38.769> fast

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
but my download is gonna go crazy fast

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.949 
but my download is gonna go crazy fast
now<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.519> reason<00:03:39.820> why<00:03:40.060> it's<00:03:40.209> going<00:03:40.360> crazy<00:03:40.690> fast

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
now the reason why it's going crazy fast

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.250 
now the reason why it's going crazy fast
because<00:03:41.230> i'm<00:03:41.320> connected<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.880> university

because i'm connected to a university

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.599 
because i'm connected to a university
universities<00:03:44.260> are<00:03:44.290> crazy<00:03:45.070> crazy<00:03:45.609> speeds<00:03:46.600> and

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
universities are crazy crazy speeds and

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.920 
universities are crazy crazy speeds and
you're<00:03:48.609> gonna<00:03:48.730> get<00:03:48.970> massive<00:03:49.390> amounts<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:49.780> I'm

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
you're gonna get massive amounts so I'm

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.400 
you're gonna get massive amounts so I'm

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.210 
get and it looks like that's what I'm
getting<00:04:03.810> 33<00:04:04.810> point<00:04:05.019> 05<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.920> sounds<00:04:06.160> about

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
getting 33 point 05 that sounds about

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.120 
getting 33 point 05 that sounds about
right<00:04:06.340> okay<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:08.230> there<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.470> go<00:04:08.530> forty<00:04:08.950> nine

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
right okay so there you go forty nine

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.460 
right okay so there you go forty nine
milliseconds<00:04:09.489> it's<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.180> ping<00:04:10.420> it's<00:04:11.079> already

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
milliseconds it's the ping it's already

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.990 
milliseconds it's the ping it's already
gone<00:04:11.739> up<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.130> now<00:04:12.250> we're<00:04:12.400> going<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.549> change<00:04:12.790> it

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
gone up so now we're going to change it

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.150 
gone up so now we're going to change it
so<00:04:13.329> now<00:04:13.510> these<00:04:14.440> servers<00:04:14.709> are<00:04:14.890> going<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.070> have

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
so now these servers are going to have

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.029 
so now these servers are going to have
to<00:04:15.250> be<00:04:15.340> restarted<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.739> everybody<00:04:17.739> knows<00:04:18.010> that

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
to be restarted and everybody knows that

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.520 
to be restarted and everybody knows that
you<00:04:19.000> can't<00:04:19.269> leave<00:04:19.450> these<00:04:19.660> things<00:04:19.870> running<00:04:20.079> 24

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
you can't leave these things running 24

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.860 
you can't leave these things running 24
57<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.370> if<00:04:21.519> they<00:04:21.640> do<00:04:21.700> updates<00:04:22.180> these<00:04:22.360> boxes

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
57 and if they do updates these boxes

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.780 
57 and if they do updates these boxes
need<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.260> be<00:04:23.409> reset

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
need to be reset

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.970 
need to be reset
so<00:04:24.880> let's<00:04:25.060> zoom<00:04:25.390> owned<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.780> was<00:04:25.870> properly<00:04:26.290> god

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
so let's zoom owned it was properly god
