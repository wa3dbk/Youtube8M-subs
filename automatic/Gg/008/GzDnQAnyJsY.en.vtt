next<00:00:09.030> one<00:00:09.240> we're<00:00:09.389> gonna<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:09.809> real<00:00:10.410> quick<00:00:10.769> is

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.779 

the<00:00:17.000> lining<00:00:18.000> pattern<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:20.250> lining

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the lining pattern and the lining

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.970 
the lining pattern and the lining
pattern<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.980> believe<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> or<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:23.869> one

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
pattern is believe it or not one

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.810 
pattern is believe it or not one
sixteenth<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:27.410> an<00:00:28.410> inch<00:00:29.179> smaller<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:31.820> you're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
sixteenth of an inch smaller that you're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
sixteenth of an inch smaller that you're
outside<00:00:33.390> pattern<00:00:34.730> that's<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.200> once<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.530> seems

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
outside pattern that's it once it seems

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
outside pattern that's it once it seems
smaller<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> we're<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.750> make<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.050> about

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
smaller so we're gonna make this about

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.180 
smaller so we're gonna make this about
600<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> try<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.440> paper<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
600 I want to try a paper is kind of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.680 
600 I want to try a paper is kind of
smallish<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:46.129> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> try<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.930> get<00:00:48.930> my

smallish so I want to try to get my
spore<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> middle<00:00:52.379> looks<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:56.899> I<00:00:58.760> look<00:00:59.760> at

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
spore in the middle looks like I look at

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.529 
spore in the middle looks like I look at
the<00:01:00.000> sea<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.600> perfection<00:01:01.430> okay<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:03.300> day

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the sea that's perfection okay one day

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.130 
the sea that's perfection okay one day
and<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.809> day<00:01:04.549> anyway<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.060> take<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:07.939> outside

and one day anyway we take our outside

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.320 
and one day anyway we take our outside
and<00:01:11.720> we're<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:14.869> that<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> sick<00:01:16.259> leave

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
and we're going to that you sick leave

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
and we're going to that you sick leave
you<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> trace<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:22.799> oh<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.220> can

you want to trace it and you oh I can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
you want to trace it and you oh I can
just<00:01:23.700> mount<00:01:24.210> measure<00:01:24.540> or<00:01:24.840> 1/16<00:01:25.650> down<00:01:26.960> we'll

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
just mount measure or 1/16 down we'll

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.800 
just mount measure or 1/16 down we'll
just<00:01:28.290> trace<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.549> then<00:01:31.610> go<00:01:32.610> once<00:01:32.850> extinct<00:01:33.390> then

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.780 

what<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.079> this

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.850 

and<00:01:44.000> then<00:01:44.570> after<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.050> little<00:01:45.140> bit<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.470> time

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
and then after a little bit of time

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.560 
and then after a little bit of time
you'll<00:01:46.400> be<00:01:46.580> able<00:01:46.730> to<00:01:47.150> just<00:01:47.890> do<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.010> 1/16<00:01:49.820> I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.660 

said<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.690> continue<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.350> make<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.740> buck<00:01:55.010> when

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
said you continue to make the buck when

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.660 
said you continue to make the buck when
you<00:01:56.320> want<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.380> send<00:01:57.620> out<00:01:57.740> your<00:01:57.950> pattern<00:01:58.220> or

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
you want to send out your pattern or

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.590 
you want to send out your pattern or
production

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
production

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.550 
production
you<00:02:00.560> really<00:02:00.890> want<00:02:01.190> on<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:02.180> pattern<00:02:02.900> for<00:02:03.260> every

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
you really want on a pattern for every

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.730 
you really want on a pattern for every
piece<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.390> there's<00:02:05.630> no<00:02:05.870> confusion<00:02:06.080> about

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
piece so that there's no confusion about

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.370 
piece so that there's no confusion about
what's<00:02:07.490> more<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:07.940> order<00:02:08.240> so<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.020> we're<00:02:09.229> going

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
what's more in order so now we're going

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.230 
what's more in order so now we're going
to<00:02:09.440> measure<00:02:09.680> in<00:02:10.090> 1/16

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
to measure in 1/16

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.170 
to measure in 1/16
so<00:02:11.390> I'm<00:02:11.480> looking<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.380> get<00:02:13.280> down<00:02:13.520> like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
so I'm looking this and get down like

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:26.950 
so I'm looking this and get down like
1/16<00:02:16.840> inside<00:02:21.430> strakes<00:02:22.430> longline<00:02:25.840> kind<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.900> a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
1/16 inside strakes longline kind of a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.900 
1/16 inside strakes longline kind of a
tedious<00:02:27.290> painter<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:29.390> lining<00:02:29.990> my<00:02:30.910> wife

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
tedious painter just lining my wife

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.070 
tedious painter just lining my wife
probably<00:02:32.240> had<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:36.170> at<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.440> last<00:02:36.620> minute

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
probably had a but at the last minute

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.980 
probably had a but at the last minute
she<00:02:39.080> decided<00:02:39.910> she<00:02:40.910> didn't<00:02:41.120> want<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.390> do<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.690> but

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
she decided she didn't want to do it but

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.090 
she decided she didn't want to do it but
since<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.470> already<00:02:42.500> know<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.130> 1/16<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:45.100> I'm

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
since I already know what 1/16 is I'm

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.210 
since I already know what 1/16 is I'm
going<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.520> just<00:02:46.700> go<00:02:47.390> down<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.780> pattern<00:02:48.220> 1/16

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
going to just go down the pattern 1/16

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.260 
going to just go down the pattern 1/16
and<00:02:51.310> what<00:02:52.310> we're<00:02:52.430> trying<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.239> just

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
and what we're trying to do here is just

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.410 
and what we're trying to do here is just
make<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> little<00:02:54.350> bit<00:02:54.650> smaller<00:02:55.239> than<00:02:56.239> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
make it a little bit smaller than the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.229 
make it a little bit smaller than the
outside

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.179 

because<00:03:05.969> this<00:03:06.969> on<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.299> inside<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> bat<00:03:08.189> so

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
because this on the inside of the bat so

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.970 
because this on the inside of the bat so
therefore<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:10.030> got<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.980> little

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
therefore it's got to be a little

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.709 
therefore it's got to be a little
smaller<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:13.349> that<00:03:14.349> should<00:03:14.709> do<00:03:15.159> it

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
smaller and that should do it

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:27.070 
smaller and that should do it
so<00:03:16.719> now<00:03:16.870> I'm<00:03:16.930> gonna<00:03:17.079> cut<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.409> out

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:04:01.500 

is<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.200> right

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.160 

and<00:04:01.989> that's<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.379> once<00:04:02.590> it's<00:04:02.860> in<00:04:03.450> blue<00:04:04.450> or<00:04:04.629> not

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:30.040 

that's<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.459> 1/16<00:04:14.250> yeah<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.919> usual

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.399 

and<00:04:31.050> there's<00:04:31.349> our<00:04:31.470> pattern<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.900> if<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.169> come

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
and there's our pattern and if you come

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.559 
and there's our pattern and if you come
sit<00:04:34.800> along<00:04:35.099> it<00:04:35.340> what's<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.699> pretty<00:04:36.090> good<00:04:36.360> right

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
sit along it what's a pretty good right

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.219 
sit along it what's a pretty good right
okay

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
okay

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.469 
okay
and<00:04:37.650> here's<00:04:37.919> our<00:04:38.099> lining<00:04:38.400> pattern<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.120> will<00:04:39.270> go

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
and here's our lining pattern it will go

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:49.939
