00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.210
 the world's first ford to introduce 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.870
 the new technology of direct injection of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.190
 for flex- fuel engines and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.190
 shows the pioneering ford engines 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:22.460
 duratec 2.0 iec flex hits the market 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.460
 exclusively in the new focus of 2014 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.720
 he ford created his first vehicle o 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.340
 motor fueled with alcohol 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.020
 he was also the first to launch a 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.390
 vehicle flex yarn in 1908 model t 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.739
 could run ethanol on gasoline in 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.199
 any proportion of motor in Brazil to 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.800
 Ford was one of the first to launch a 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.400
 alcohol vehicle in 2002 presented the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.379
 first flex prototype also innovated with 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 Flex engines with high compression ratio 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.730
 the zetec rocks introduce the block and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.530
 aluminum head in duratec launched 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.080
 a new generation developed 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.770
 especially to be flex the family 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.039
 sigma recently introduced the sigma 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.420
 I had city ​​flex of dual command and launched 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.180
 a new sigma 1.5 flex engine now 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.940
 direct injection flex wire enhances the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.729
 performance of the engine avoiding waste 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.070
 developed by engineering 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.020
 Brazilian system, this system 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.240
 perfect electronic management of 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.250
 engine and also performs the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.890
 extreme conditions without the aid of 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.459
 the operation of this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 technology is a work of art a journey 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:48.459
 inside the duratec rec flex motor 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.890
 shows how this application to 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.929
 fuel the vehicle fuel follows 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.940
 through a gallery until you reach a bomb 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.770
 very high pressure mechanics that 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.459
 distributes the fuel for the call 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.709
 the flute where the nozzles are 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.959
 dual independent variable control of 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.390
 control valves 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.060
 intake and exhaust air flow in 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.569
 perfect synchrony with the injection in high 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.220
 pressure inside the cylinder 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.819
 super-efficient operates at a high 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.130
 compression ratio of the order of 12 to 11 with 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.500
 help of intelligent management sensors 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.080
 the fuel is burned at the exact location 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.870
 where it is needed and at the right time 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.489
 catalyst action contributes to the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.890
 emissions reduction 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.440
 at the same time the components are 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.650
 protected from the oxidation action present 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.810
 no ethanol 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.480
 is a meticulous engineering work of 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.700
 calibration and suitability of the two types of 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.069
 fuels present in the vehicle 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.159
 the challenge of offering direct injection 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.900
 flex peep was overcome by the strong 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.719
 the result is a combustion process 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.939
 flex model that generates more 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.400
 power and economy 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.230
 this is a new platform for the flex engine 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.469
 high performance 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.739
 eletec flex duratec 2.0 teaming 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.780
 the new ford focus 2014 and is the first 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.209
 car with exclusive system of 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.139
 direct injection of ethanol and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.169
 world 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.780
 is the innovating Ford once again to 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:21.709
 offer state-of-the-art performance 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.709
 for the Brazilian consumer
