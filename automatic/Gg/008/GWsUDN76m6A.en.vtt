they get their motion from things to

bend and deflect instead of hinges and
bearings<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.280> eventually<00:01:00.850> we<00:01:01.060> realize

a client mechanism and these folded
designs<00:01:10.270> are<00:01:10.689> usually<00:01:11.049> more<00:01:11.200> flexible<00:01:11.799> have

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
designs are usually more flexible have

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.789 
designs are usually more flexible have
fewer<00:01:12.579> moving<00:01:12.850> parts<00:01:12.999> and<00:01:13.600> require<00:01:14.439> less

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
fewer moving parts and require less

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.859 
fewer moving parts and require less
maintenance<00:01:14.829> than<00:01:15.579> traditional<00:01:16.479> ones

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
maintenance than traditional ones

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.080 
maintenance than traditional ones
yeah<00:01:17.439> I've<00:01:17.590> have<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.069> be<00:01:18.189> tilted<00:01:18.639> or<00:01:18.759> something

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
yeah I've have to be tilted or something

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.270 
yeah I've have to be tilted or something
so<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.329> has<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:19.659> stable<00:01:20.139> state<00:01:20.439> right<00:01:20.710> and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
so it has this stable state right and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.429 
so it has this stable state right and
what<00:01:21.549> works<00:01:21.759> for<00:01:21.880> paper<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.929> also<00:01:23.079> work<00:01:23.409> with

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
what works for paper can also work with

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.059 
what works for paper can also work with

no bearings or hinges friction because

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.179 
no bearings or hinges friction because
it<00:01:36.069> looks<00:01:36.340> really<00:01:36.670> crazy<00:01:36.880> but<00:01:37.179> it<00:01:37.329> has<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.539> very

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it looks really crazy but it has a very

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.410 
it looks really crazy but it has a very
important<00:01:39.840> precision<00:01:40.840> motion<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.100> here<00:01:42.579> is

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
important precision motion and here is

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.870 
important precision motion and here is
that<00:01:44.020> same<00:01:44.350> device<00:01:44.529> but<00:01:44.950> shown<00:01:45.249> as<00:01:45.520> having<00:01:45.850> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.699 
that same device but shown as having a
thruster<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.719> there's<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.139> thruster<00:01:47.560> this

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709

products<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:29.340> right<00:02:29.550> here<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.819> inspired

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
products and this right here is inspired

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.340 
products and this right here is inspired
by<00:02:31.670> origami<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> traditional

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
by origami this is a traditional

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.090 
by origami this is a traditional
butterfly<00:02:34.800> chair<00:02:35.100> with<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.640> variation<00:02:37.100> so

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
butterfly chair with just a variation so

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.890 
butterfly chair with just a variation so
I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.910> lot<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.090> people<00:02:39.480> when<00:02:39.600> they<00:02:39.720> hear

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I think a lot of people when they hear

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.590 
I think a lot of people when they hear
you<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.290> origami<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.450> we're

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
you know origami really but we're

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.020 
you know origami really but we're
talking<00:02:42.780> about<00:02:43.459> applications<00:02:44.459> can<00:02:44.700> really

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
talking about applications can really

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
talking about applications can really
make<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> difference<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> world<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.200> do

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
make a difference in the world to do

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.729 
make a difference in the world to do
things<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.130> never<00:02:47.190> been<00:02:47.670> done<00:02:48.120> before

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
things that have never been done before

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.300 
things that have never been done before
because<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.910> have<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.480> connection<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.410> this

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
because we have this connection of this

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640 
because we have this connection of this
learning<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.030> comes<00:02:54.269> from<00:02:54.480> origami<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.380> NS

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
learning that comes from origami and NS

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.220

connection<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> engineering<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.750> whether

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
connection to the engineering so whether

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.560 
connection to the engineering so whether
it's<00:02:58.410> catching<00:02:58.650> solar<00:02:59.160> rays<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.670> space<00:03:00.000> or

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it's catching solar rays in space or

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.440 
it's catching solar rays in space or
