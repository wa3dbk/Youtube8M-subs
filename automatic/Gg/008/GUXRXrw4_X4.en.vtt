the unit anyway let's have a look at the

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.449 
the unit anyway let's have a look at the
quality<00:02:53.330> for<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.810> playback<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> I'm<00:02:55.220> going<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
quality for the playback so I'm going to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:09.400 
quality for the playback so I'm going to
start<00:02:55.670> power<00:02:55.880> DVD<00:03:07.569> now<00:03:08.569> PowerDVD<00:03:09.049> I've

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
start power DVD now PowerDVD I've

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.520 
start power DVD now PowerDVD I've
actually<00:03:09.590> set<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.630> open<00:03:11.630> up<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.230> other

ages<00:04:02.180> is<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:04.400> time<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:04.730> time

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
ages is because from time to time

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.069 
ages is because from time to time
they'll<00:04:05.150> actually<00:04:06.519> change<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.850> blu-ray<00:04:08.540> copy

they'll actually change the blu-ray copy

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.300 
they'll actually change the blu-ray copy
protection<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.859> which<00:04:11.410> can<00:04:12.410> take<00:04:12.620> some

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
protection on it which can take some

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.270 
protection on it which can take some
units<00:04:13.609> longer<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.940> play<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.769> make<00:04:16.250> sure

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
units longer to play so make sure

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:52.840 
units longer to play so make sure
English<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:16.940> chosen<00:04:17.209> here

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850

so let's say for example we looked down

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.940 
so let's say for example we looked down
just<00:04:57.960> what<00:04:58.050> they<00:04:58.140> call<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.650> blu-ray

quality<00:06:10.419> is<00:06:10.449> just<00:06:10.719> gorgeous<00:06:11.679> to<00:06:11.949> look<00:06:11.979> at<00:06:12.219> and

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
quality is just gorgeous to look at and

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.959 
quality is just gorgeous to look at and
well<00:06:14.949> that's<00:06:15.129> plain<00:06:15.339> let's<00:06:15.549> have<00:06:15.669> a<00:06:15.729> look<00:06:15.879> at

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
well that's plain let's have a look at

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:22.529 
well that's plain let's have a look at
the<00:06:16.449> CPU<00:06:16.629> usage<00:06:20.639> so<00:06:21.639> we<00:06:21.729> can<00:06:21.879> here<00:06:22.029> see<00:06:22.359> here

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
the CPU usage so we can here see here

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.499 
the CPU usage so we can here see here
the<00:06:22.689> full<00:06:22.839> course<00:06:23.369> in<00:06:24.369> the<00:06:24.519> i5<00:06:24.849> processor<00:06:25.419> that

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
the full course in the i5 processor that

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.989 
the full course in the i5 processor that
I'm<00:06:25.629> using<00:06:25.839> in<00:06:26.049> the<00:06:26.109> MacBook<00:06:26.609> so<00:06:27.609> two<00:06:27.669> of<00:06:27.879> those

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:27.999 
I'm using in the MacBook so two of those

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:31.829 
I'm using in the MacBook so two of those
cause<00:06:28.299> of<00:06:28.859> being<00:06:29.859> put<00:06:30.039> to<00:06:30.189> good<00:06:30.219> use<00:06:30.399> you<00:06:30.839> can

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839 
cause of being put to good use you can

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.509 
cause of being put to good use you can
see<00:06:31.989> it<00:06:32.109> doesn't<00:06:32.379> really<00:06:32.499> use<00:06:32.679> a<00:06:32.709> great<00:06:33.189> deal

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:33.519 
see it doesn't really use a great deal

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:39.959 
see it doesn't really use a great deal
of<00:06:33.549> the<00:06:33.789> CPU<00:06:35.219> comes<00:06:36.219> and<00:06:36.369> goes<00:06:36.519> and<00:06:36.669> boosts<00:06:38.969> now

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
of the CPU comes and goes and boosts now

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:48.640 
of the CPU comes and goes and boosts now
if<00:06:40.059> you<00:06:40.149> wonder<00:06:40.619> the<00:06:41.619> temperature<00:06:42.129> of<00:06:42.939> the<00:06:43.059> CPU

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.510 

we'll<00:06:49.190> have<00:06:49.340> a<00:06:49.370> look<00:06:49.550> at<00:06:51.250> temperature<00:06:52.250> that<00:06:52.400> we

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
we'll have a look at temperature that we

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.930 
we'll have a look at temperature that we
get<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:57.680> it<00:06:57.800> hovers<00:06:58.070> around<00:06:58.190> anywhere<00:06:58.730> between

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
get so it hovers around anywhere between

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.350 
get so it hovers around anywhere between
say<00:06:59.810> 54<00:07:00.380> degrees<00:07:00.770> and<00:07:01.160> 62<00:07:01.790> degrees<00:07:01.970> is<00:07:02.330> the

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
say 54 degrees and 62 degrees is the

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
say 54 degrees and 62 degrees is the
highest<00:07:02.720> I've<00:07:02.870> seen<00:07:03.080> goats<00:07:03.380> so<00:07:03.860> far<00:07:05.170> and<00:07:06.170> it's

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
highest I've seen goats so far and it's

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.860 
highest I've seen goats so far and it's
discharging<00:07:06.980> at<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.340> rate<00:07:07.520> of<00:07:07.870> currently

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
discharging at the rate of currently

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.360 
discharging at the rate of currently
17.8<00:07:09.680> watts

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
17.8 watts

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.120 
17.8 watts
mind<00:07:11.240> you<00:07:11.420> though<00:07:11.600> I<00:07:11.630> have<00:07:11.930> bluetooth<00:07:12.560> on<00:07:12.770> and

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
mind you though I have bluetooth on and

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.440 
mind you though I have bluetooth on and
I<00:07:13.250> have<00:07:13.400> Wi-Fi<00:07:13.820> on<00:07:13.850> I<00:07:15.400> would<00:07:16.400> estimate<00:07:16.550> that

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
I have Wi-Fi on I would estimate that

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.260 
I have Wi-Fi on I would estimate that
you<00:07:18.350> should<00:07:18.530> easily<00:07:18.740> be<00:07:18.920> able<00:07:19.100> to<00:07:19.280> get<00:07:19.520> around

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
you should easily be able to get around

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.940 
you should easily be able to get around
about<00:07:20.690> two<00:07:20.900> and<00:07:21.020> a<00:07:21.050> half<00:07:21.230> hours<00:07:21.590> of<00:07:21.620> playback

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 
about two and a half hours of playback

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.130 
about two and a half hours of playback
if<00:07:22.670> you're<00:07:22.910> just<00:07:23.120> going<00:07:23.360> from<00:07:23.570> battery<00:07:23.870> only

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
if you're just going from battery only

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:31.390 
if you're just going from battery only
on<00:07:24.230> this<00:07:28.270> so<00:07:29.470> overall<00:07:30.470> I'm<00:07:30.680> very<00:07:30.950> very

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
on this so overall I'm very very

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.320 
on this so overall I'm very very
impressed<00:07:31.610> with<00:07:32.000> this<00:07:32.180> unit<00:07:32.540> and<00:07:34.180> there's<00:07:35.180> my

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
impressed with this unit and there's my

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.700 
impressed with this unit and there's my
review<00:07:36.340> thanks<00:07:37.340> for<00:07:37.460> watching
