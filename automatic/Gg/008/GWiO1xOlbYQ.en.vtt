I think he was the first team manager
there<00:02:37.569> he's<00:02:37.780> got<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> huge<00:02:38.530> reputation<00:02:38.830> in

not<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> typical<00:02:47.950> English<00:02:48.100> way<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
not a typical English way with the

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.839 
not a typical English way with the
kicking<00:02:49.510> rush<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.930> stuff<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:51.220> play

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
kicking rush and stuff but but just play

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.839 
kicking rush and stuff but but just play
on<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> ground<00:02:52.269> play<00:02:52.569> football<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.849> and

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
on the ground play football and and

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.400 
on the ground play football and and
that's<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.209> way<00:02:55.299> he<00:02:55.690> likes<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.049> play<00:02:56.140> football

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410

education there so I love I love the way
and<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
and and and I I like it and it's a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.300 
and and and I I like it and it's a
little<00:03:25.780> bit<00:03:25.900> same<00:03:26.140> way<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.319> I<00:03:26.470> think<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.980> gonna

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
little bit same way so I think it gonna

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.930 
little bit same way so I think it gonna
be<00:03:27.459> feel<00:03:28.500> confidence<00:03:29.500> here<00:03:29.709> very<00:03:30.280> very<00:03:30.670> quick

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
be feel confidence here very very quick

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.539 
be feel confidence here very very quick
so<00:03:31.180> that's<00:03:32.079> that's<00:03:32.500> that's<00:03:32.829> that's<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.430> good

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
so that's that's that's that's a good

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.129 
so that's that's that's that's a good
point<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.850> think<00:03:33.910> there'll<00:03:34.510> be<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.630> few<00:03:34.840> people

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
point I think there'll be a few people

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.479 
point I think there'll be a few people
here<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.530> recognize<00:03:35.950> from<00:03:36.069> your<00:03:36.310> time

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
here that you recognize from your time

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.069 
here that you recognize from your time
in<00:03:36.519> Holland<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:36.970> believe<00:03:37.239> two<00:03:37.450> sons<00:03:37.720> Harridge

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
in Holland I believe two sons Harridge

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.750 
in Holland I believe two sons Harridge
Graziano<00:03:38.650> Pella<00:03:38.950> people<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.459> must<00:03:39.579> have

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
Graziano Pella people you must have

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.569 
Graziano Pella people you must have
played<00:03:39.910> against<00:03:40.239> in<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.389> Eredivisie<00:03:40.630> yeah

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
played against in the Eredivisie yeah

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.430 
played against in the Eredivisie yeah
those<00:03:42.579> players<00:03:42.819> are<00:03:43.000> one<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.260> best

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
those players are one of the on the best

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.840 
those players are one of the on the best
players<00:03:44.650> then<00:03:44.889> in<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.069> league<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.519> think

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
players then in the league so I think

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.640 
players then in the league so I think
something<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.750> make<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.930> good<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.260> transfers

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
something to make a good of transfers

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.190 
something to make a good of transfers
from<00:03:48.340> their<00:03:48.549> disease<00:03:48.819> here<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.900> it's<00:03:50.019> a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
from their disease here it's a it's a

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.080 
from their disease here it's a it's a
one-year<00:03:50.530> loan<00:03:50.739> at<00:03:51.100> first<00:03:51.459> are<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.819> looking

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
one-year loan at first are you looking

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.160 
one-year loan at first are you looking
beyond<00:03:52.359> that<00:03:52.569> are<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.810> very<00:03:52.989> much

concentrating<00:03:53.920> on<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:54.430> season<00:03:54.819> I<00:03:54.970> think

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
concentrating on this season I think

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.449 
concentrating on this season I think
this<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.139> important<00:03:56.530> because<00:03:56.590> something

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
this is it's important because something

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.910 
this is it's important because something
to<00:03:57.579> put<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> lot<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.180> effort<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.660> get<00:03:59.290> me<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.650> I

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
ago I think or three or four years ago I

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.540

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
against our tenting we won 1-0 so I had

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.219 
against our tenting we won 1-0 so I had
a<00:05:12.640> good<00:05:12.820> feeling<00:05:13.030> about<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:14.080> was<00:05:14.200> the

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
a good feeling about it and that was the

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.870 
a good feeling about it and that was the
first<00:05:14.440> year<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.710> they<00:05:15.400> came<00:05:15.610> from<00:05:15.669> the

first year that they came from the
championship<00:05:16.539> I<00:05:16.630> think<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.469> think<00:05:18.430> they

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
championship I think so I think they

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.290 
championship I think so I think they
have<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:19.210> lot<00:05:19.419> and<00:05:19.690> I'm<00:05:20.760> very<00:05:21.760> glad<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.150> be<00:05:22.270> a
