00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello in this psuv video and show the 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.919
 toss paper game for our samsung 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.990
 galaxy is a free game and quite 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.000
 entertaining that you are going to be able to download 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.270
 of this link that I leave here in the 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.749
 description the game is very entertaining 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.609
 and the main downside is that it brings ads 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.169
 but well these ads can be 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.140
 disable in a pretty way 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.300
 simple remove the wifi remove the 3g 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.980
 and ready as these ads connect 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.169
 on the internet as you can see I do not 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.570
 appear to me this game brings different 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.149
 modes and here we can see our 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.550
 scores and let's see the first 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.239
 so that is the easy mode the game has 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.969
 a really addictive theme is a 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.760
 ball of paper which we have to go in 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.859
 throwing into our trash 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.940
 to try in this to be in addition as 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.829
 you see we have this air here that we 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.390
 move the paper ball so there's 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.579
 have to take it into account for 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 and dunk 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 As you can see, he changes position 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.720
 fan 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.880
 and change the speed at which the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.130
 basically the theme is to try 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.380
 get the highest possible score 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.380
 followed the highest record 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.520
 There are as you see, there are 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.439
 enough speed or less speed 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.820
 and well let's try the following way 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.329
 which is the average way as you see the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.210
 trash bin moves away and also varies 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.040
 quite the air speed affects you 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.380
 Much more 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 so much that as you can see I sent the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.210
 ball pretty far and in that state 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.370
 it's a pretty addictive truth game 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.250
 you do not need a very powerful phone 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.130
 nothing and simply need to have 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.950
 I want to play, I really use it 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.260
 enough to hang out 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.200
 because it's pretty good 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.360
 let's move to the next mode 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 difficult and good this already as you see is 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.500
 practically impossible 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 you have to send the ball far away to 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.920
 dunk 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.079
 As you can see, that's a matter of going 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.090
 overcoming the different modes also 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.720
 there are more scenarios like 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.550
 airport 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.940
 that would be like the easy mode of the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.940
 office 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.170
 and everything is that is to control a 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.170
 little bit the speed of 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 of the fan and good this game has 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.000
 another way that is the restum as you see 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.579
 it's the complicated way of the office 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.099
 again and I would also have the mode 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.189
 basement but this way I'm not going to 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.290
 show because you have an error when 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.840
 we start this mode the screen will 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.420
 it comes back as well as gray and it does not leave us 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.189
 leaving the game does not let us go back to the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.849
 game we will have to leave the 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.739
 application kill it and restart it 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.780
 so this has been all in this 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.700
 video is a pretty simple game and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.590
 quite entertaining that deserves much 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.419
 sorry do not forget to install like a
