00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.150 
I'll think it is it's about the same
size<00:01:43.450> or<00:01:43.509> probably<00:01:44.500> even<00:01:44.679> bigger<00:01:44.830> than<00:01:45.069> the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
size or probably even bigger than the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:55.070 
size or probably even bigger than the
French<00:01:45.429> course<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:47.940> lot<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.119> content<00:01:49.599> there<00:01:51.899> yes

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:54.350 
binding one so yeah my guy see that's
like<00:06:47.760> that's<00:06:47.940> the<00:06:48.120> door<00:06:48.890> layout<00:06:49.890> new<00:06:50.700> box<00:06:53.360> no

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
like that's the door layout new box no

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.690 
like that's the door layout new box no
so<00:06:55.230> this<00:06:55.380> is<00:06:55.530> the<00:06:55.620> first<00:06:55.890> time<00:06:56.100> I<00:06:56.130> ordered<00:06:56.550> this

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
so this is the first time I ordered this

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.880 
so this is the first time I ordered this
directly<00:06:57.180> from<00:06:57.270> I<00:06:57.630> seen<00:06:57.840> your<00:06:57.990> site<00:06:58.230> very<00:06:58.650> very

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
directly from I seen your site very very

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.910 
directly from I seen your site very very
first<00:06:59.190> time<00:06:59.430> one<00:06:59.820> of<00:06:59.970> the<00:07:00.030> court<00:07:00.300> smoked<00:07:00.510> there

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920 
first time one of the court smoked there

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.250 
first time one of the court smoked there
normally<00:07:01.920> I<00:07:01.950> will<00:07:02.100> get<00:07:02.340> them<00:07:02.490> from<00:07:02.750> Amazon<00:07:03.750> but

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
normally I will get them from Amazon but

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.320 
normally I will get them from Amazon but
I<00:07:04.320> think<00:07:04.590> they<00:07:04.680> cost<00:07:04.950> more<00:07:05.250> like<00:07:05.640> if<00:07:05.790> you<00:07:05.910> were

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
I think they cost more like if you were

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.910 
I think they cost more like if you were
to<00:07:06.420> get<00:07:06.570> this<00:07:06.720> on<00:07:06.900> Amazon<00:07:07.080> the<00:07:07.440> probably<00:07:07.710> cost

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
to get this on Amazon the probably cost

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.370 
to get this on Amazon the probably cost
me<00:07:08.100> a<00:07:08.160> little<00:07:08.310> more<00:07:08.900> so<00:07:09.900> I<00:07:09.930> just<00:07:10.140> went<00:07:10.260> ahead

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380
