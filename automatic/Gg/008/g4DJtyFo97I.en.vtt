00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.630 
just to pop over the top and just set
that<00:03:46.260> aside<00:03:46.470> now<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:49.620> want<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.280> make

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
that aside now you want to just make

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.350 
that aside now you want to just make
sprouts<00:03:51.210> from<00:03:51.720> those<00:03:51.960> grains<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.820> what<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.180> do

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
sprouts from those grains so what you do

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.440 
sprouts from those grains so what you do
is<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:55.230> 48<00:03:55.920> hours<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.960> complete<00:03:58.440> days<00:03:59.450> you're

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
is for 48 hours to complete days you're

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.820 
is for 48 hours to complete days you're
going<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.750> take<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.290> back<00:04:01.500> out<00:04:02.240> wrap<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.480> up

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
going to take the back out wrap it up

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.160 
going to take the back out wrap it up
and<00:04:04.830> you're<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> reach<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:06.140> twice<00:04:07.140> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
and you're going to reach that twice a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.880 
and you're going to reach that twice a
day<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.590> morning<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.490> night<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:10.350> start<00:04:10.650> using

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
day so morning and night you start using

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.730 
day so morning and night you start using
these<00:04:11.280> sprouts<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.780> will<00:04:13.020> find<00:04:13.440> that

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
these sprouts and you will find that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.880 
these sprouts and you will find that
they'll<00:04:13.950> get<00:04:14.160> about<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.790> quarter<00:04:15.300> inch<00:04:15.890> sprout

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
they'll get about a quarter inch sprout

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.849 
they'll get about a quarter inch sprout
forming<00:04:17.460> on<00:04:17.609> them<00:04:17.820> over<00:04:18.299> them<00:04:18.450> 48<00:04:19.109> hours

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
forming on them over them 48 hours

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.360
