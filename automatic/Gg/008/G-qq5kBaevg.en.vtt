00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
to incorporate the ball with actual

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.169 
to incorporate the ball with actual
movement<00:00:07.140> as<00:00:07.319> McKay<00:00:07.710> dribbles<00:00:08.189> you're<00:00:09.059> going

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
movement as McKay dribbles you're going

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.730 
movement as McKay dribbles you're going
to<00:00:09.269> notice<00:00:09.510> you're<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.230> see<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> lot<00:00:10.710> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the different movements that we did with

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.240 
the different movements that we did with
the<00:00:12.780> footwork<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.380> even<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.009> ladder

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the footwork and even with the ladder

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.250 
the footwork and even with the ladder
only<00:00:14.610> incorporated<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> ball<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:16.049> they're

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
only incorporated the ball that they're

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.490 
only incorporated the ball that they're
all<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> come<00:00:17.270> into<00:00:18.500> flourishing

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
all now going to come into flourishing

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590 
all now going to come into flourishing
into<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.010> next<00:00:20.310> activity<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:21.240> McKay

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
into this next activity with McKay

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.570 
into this next activity with McKay
dribbling<00:00:22.080> we're<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> time<00:00:23.039> him<00:00:23.369> for

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
dribbling we're going to time him for

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.460 
dribbling we're going to time him for
speed<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.180> put<00:00:24.390> him<00:00:24.510> under<00:00:24.630> pressure<00:00:24.960> because

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
speed to put him under pressure because

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
speed to put him under pressure because
that<00:00:25.740> part<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.070> important<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.359> them

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that part is important I can have them

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.820 
that part is important I can have them
go<00:00:27.570> through<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.990> motions<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.500> soccer

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
go through the motions but soccer

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.470 
go through the motions but soccer
players<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.670> able<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> perform<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
players got to be able to perform at a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
players got to be able to perform at a
high<00:00:30.510> technique<00:00:31.230> under<00:00:31.980> pressure<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.210> add

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
high technique under pressure so we add

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049 
high technique under pressure so we add
time<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> time<00:00:34.469> element<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.910> add

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
time and a time element to it to add

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.020 
time and a time element to it to add
that<00:00:36.480> element<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.050> pressure

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
that element of pressure

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.400 
that element of pressure

there's got to be the right range of

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.390 
there's got to be the right range of
motion<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:20.230> recovering<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.859> the<00:02:20.950> Mexi<00:02:21.310> me

so as you probably saw you saw some of

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.110 
so as you probably saw you saw some of
the<00:02:45.720> stuff<00:02:45.750> getting<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.620> ladder<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.220> motion

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the stuff getting a ladder that motion

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.690 
the stuff getting a ladder that motion
that<00:02:48.330> move<00:02:48.680> called<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.799> step<00:02:50.069> over<00:02:50.250> or<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
that move called the step over or the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.830 
that move called the step over or the
cross<00:02:50.909> over<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.299> Rivelino

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
cross over the Rivelino

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.520 
cross over the Rivelino
has<00:02:52.530> many<00:02:52.799> different<00:02:52.950> names<00:02:54.440> dragging<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
has many different names dragging the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.149 
has many different names dragging the
ball<00:02:55.739> back<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.940> saw<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.829> motion

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
ball back as you saw it in that motion

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.300 
ball back as you saw it in that motion
with<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.879> ladders<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:00.930> all<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.620> footwork<00:03:02.159> is

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
with the ladders so all this footwork is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.399 
with the ladders so all this footwork is
incorporated<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.390> game<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
incorporated with the game into the

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.380 
incorporated with the game into the
moves<00:03:04.650> being<00:03:05.340> able<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.579> become<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.909> technical

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
moves being able to become a technical

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.300 
moves being able to become a technical
player<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.290> kills<00:03:07.500> all<00:03:07.680> mckay<00:03:08.160> is

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
player now that kills all mckay is

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759 
player now that kills all mckay is
obviously<00:03:08.730> very<00:03:09.030> skillful<00:03:09.599> but<00:03:09.840> these<00:03:10.620> are

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
obviously very skillful but these are

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:11.990 
obviously very skillful but these are
the<00:03:10.829> type<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> things<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.549> make<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the type of things that make you a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.830 
the type of things that make you a
better<00:03:12.239> player

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
better player

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.869

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
so what we're going to do now is that

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.599 
so what we're going to do now is that
we're<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.150> time<00:03:15.540> them<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.079> speed<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
we're going to time them for speed so I

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.059
