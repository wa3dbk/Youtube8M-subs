00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that and we are going to create a sort

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.200 
that and we are going to create a sort
of<00:00:39.149> mini<00:00:39.450> tutorial<00:00:40.430> explanation<00:00:41.430> video<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of mini tutorial explanation video and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.139 
of mini tutorial explanation video and
put<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.350> fairly<00:00:44.129> soon<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.640> does<00:00:44.850> take<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
put that out fairly soon it does take a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.850 
put that out fairly soon it does take a
little<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.899> put<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.260> things<00:00:46.590> together

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
little time to put these things together

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.000 
little time to put these things together
in<00:00:47.840> addition<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.500> got<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> lot<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
in addition to this we got a lot of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.979 
in addition to this we got a lot of
questions<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> comments<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.570> whether

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
questions and comments about whether

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
questions and comments about whether
this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.710> directional<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:54.449> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this is one directional and as I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
this is one directional and as I
explained<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> video<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.160> also<00:00:56.250> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
explained in the video and also in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
explained in the video and also in
response<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.270> those<00:00:57.420> questions<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.170> comments

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
response to those questions and comments

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.119 
response to those questions and comments
in<00:00:58.739> fact<00:00:59.579> it's<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.829> using<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> right

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
in fact it's not and using the right

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.920 
in fact it's not and using the right
methods<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> make<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> fully

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
methods you can make this a fully

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.310 
methods you can make this a fully
bi-directional<00:01:04.920> portal<00:01:05.400> hopping<00:01:05.760> stream<00:01:06.320> but

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
bi-directional portal hopping stream but

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020 
bi-directional portal hopping stream but
that<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:07.830> wasn't<00:01:08.070> good<00:01:08.460> enough<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.970> people

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that still wasn't good enough for people

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
that still wasn't good enough for people
they<00:01:09.510> said<00:01:09.780> no<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.229> can't<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
they said no you can't do that or I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.020 
they said no you can't do that or I
don't<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.990> work<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:14.030> wouldn't

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
don't think this will work I wouldn't

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.039 
don't think this will work I wouldn't
mention<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.689> unless<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.170> could<00:01:16.320> work<00:01:16.939> anyway

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
mention it unless it could work anyway

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
mention it unless it could work anyway
here's<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.380> video<00:01:19.799> we've<00:01:20.640> taken<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.270> old

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
here's this video we've taken the old

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.679 
here's this video we've taken the old
map<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.820> retrofitted<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> reverse<00:01:24.360> direction

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
map and retrofitted a reverse direction

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.469 
map and retrofitted a reverse direction
portal<00:01:25.590> string<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:27.420> have

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
portal string in it I would have

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
portal string in it I would have
preferred<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.110> done<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> fresh

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
preferred to have done this with a fresh

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.120 
preferred to have done this with a fresh
map<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> new<00:01:30.329> set<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> calculations

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
map and a new set of calculations

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.350 
map and a new set of calculations
because<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.490> been<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.700> whole<00:01:33.090> lot

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
because it would have been a whole lot

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.200 
because it would have been a whole lot
easier<00:01:33.409> but<00:01:34.409> why<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.070> something<00:01:35.670> easy<00:01:35.880> when

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
easier but why do something easy when

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.700 
easier but why do something easy when
you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:37.020> difficult<00:01:37.350> for

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you can make it really difficult for

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.100 
you can make it really difficult for
yourself<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:38.850> least<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.299> shows<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.930> be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
yourself but at least it shows it can be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.359 
yourself but at least it shows it can be
done<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> essentially<00:01:43.470> we've<00:01:43.710> started<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
done so essentially we've started this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
done so essentially we've started this
journey<00:01:44.670> back<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.750> at<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> beginning<00:01:46.170> at

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
journey back right at the beginning at

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.160 
journey back right at the beginning at
that<00:01:46.860> farm<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> we've<00:01:48.360> traveled<00:01:48.810> through<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that farm and we've traveled through in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
that farm and we've traveled through in
the<00:01:49.290> normal<00:01:49.680> direction<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.310> you've<00:01:50.490> all

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the normal direction which you've all

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.630 
the normal direction which you've all
seen<00:01:50.880> before<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> previous<00:01:51.659> video<00:01:52.640> we're

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
seen before in the previous video we're

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.100 
seen before in the previous video we're
going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> end<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> jungle<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
going to end up at the jungle in a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.280 
going to end up at the jungle in a
moment<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.670> we'll<00:01:57.270> head<00:01:57.540> back<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
moment and then we'll head back in the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.639 
moment and then we'll head back in the
reverse<00:01:58.649> direction<00:01:59.390> here<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.509> are<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
reverse direction here we are at the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.160 
reverse direction here we are at the
jungle<00:02:02.149> just<00:02:03.149> wait<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.479> these<00:02:03.630> chunks<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
jungle just wait for these chunks to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.580 
jungle just wait for these chunks to
load<00:02:04.969> now<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.659> information<00:02:06.990> for

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
load now a little bit of information for

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.940 
load now a little bit of information for
those<00:02:07.710> really<00:02:08.220> technically<00:02:09.030> minded<00:02:09.950> the

those really technically minded the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.240 
those really technically minded the
second<00:02:11.400> string<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.819> portals<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.720> phased<00:02:13.560> lock

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
move across to the second string now so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.790 
move across to the second string now so
that<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.680> back<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:45.330> off<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:46.050> go<00:02:46.080> all

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that we are going into those portals now

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.790 
that we are going into those portals now
I'm<00:02:57.420> not<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.720> boy<00:02:57.959> you're<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.650> and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
out you've seen going in and out of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.630 
out you've seen going in and out of
portals<00:03:00.840> I'm<00:03:01.080> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> speed<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.860> up<00:03:02.100> just<00:03:02.520> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
portals I'm going to speed it up just a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.920 
portals I'm going to speed it up just a
little<00:03:02.670> no<00:03:03.420> cuts

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
little no cuts

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.410 
little no cuts
and<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.920> way<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.340> get<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.850> end<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.390> bit

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and that way we can get to the end a bit

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:37.200 
and that way we can get to the end a bit
quicker

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.450 

so<00:03:38.210> here<00:03:38.420> we<00:03:38.540> are<00:03:38.570> back<00:03:39.350> at<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.650> farm<00:03:39.950> back

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
so here we are back at the farm back

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.580 
so here we are back at the farm back
where<00:03:40.730> we<00:03:40.760> began<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.930> there<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.290> it

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590

you something here showing you how the

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.680 
you something here showing you how the
two<00:03:51.500> strings<00:03:52.040> are<00:03:52.400> interleaved<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.390> happens

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
two strings are interleaved this happens

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.350 
two strings are interleaved this happens
to<00:03:53.840> be<00:03:53.870> portal<00:03:54.560> location<00:03:55.490> number<00:03:55.790> 12

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
to be portal location number 12

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.350 
to be portal location number 12
there's<00:03:56.780> your<00:03:57.200> two<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.310> farm<00:03:58.610> portal<00:03:59.150> and
