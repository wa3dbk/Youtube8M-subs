00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
baseboard here look see that that's just

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.029 
baseboard here look see that that's just
a<00:00:22.410> straight<00:00:22.730> low<00:00:24.080> right<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.349> this<00:00:25.859> is

a straight low right here this is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
a straight low right here this is
probably<00:00:26.400> two<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.820> quarter<00:00:27.119> inches<00:00:27.390> tall

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
there that's one piece base og it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
there that's one piece base og it's
called<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.979> usually<00:00:37.979> that<00:00:38.190> means<00:00:38.400> the<00:00:38.610> bottom

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
called and usually that means the bottom

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
called and usually that means the bottom
is<00:00:39.239> flat<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.900> then<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.049> does<00:00:40.229> some<00:00:40.440> little

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
is flat and then it does some little

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.490 
is flat and then it does some little
curlicue<00:00:41.309> business<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.140> along<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
curlicue business you know up along the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.320 
curlicue business you know up along the
side<00:00:43.739> well<00:00:44.400> why<00:00:44.670> didn't<00:00:44.909> they<00:00:44.970> do<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.269> over

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
side well why didn't they do that over

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.410 
side well why didn't they do that over
here<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.559> didn't<00:00:46.979> want<00:00:47.369> to<00:00:47.489> spend<00:00:48.299> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
here it just didn't want to spend the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.020 
here it just didn't want to spend the
extra<00:00:48.479> money<00:00:48.839> I<00:00:49.080> guess<00:00:51.110> now<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:53.030> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
extra money I guess now also this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.920 
extra money I guess now also this
ceiling<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.559> pretty<00:00:55.860> tall<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.430> nine

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
ceiling it's pretty tall it's about nine

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.450 
ceiling it's pretty tall it's about nine
nine<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.110> ten<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> probably<00:00:58.769> actually<00:00:59.190> ten

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
nine or ten is probably actually ten

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.609 
nine or ten is probably actually ten

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.340 
of got away with it because the floor is
pretty<00:01:55.320> dark<00:01:55.650> so<00:01:56.159> dark<00:01:56.190> this<00:01:56.610> floor<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.350> okay

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
pretty dark so dark this floor is okay

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.789 
pretty dark so dark this floor is okay
and<00:01:58.729> most<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.940> base<00:02:00.120> is<00:02:00.360> fine<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.960> but

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and most of the base is fine but but

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.860 
and most of the base is fine but but
over<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> gap<00:02:05.070> right<00:02:05.340> there

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
over here you see the gap right there

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.809 
over here you see the gap right there
from<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:06.990> bottom<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> base<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.640> hold

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
from the bottom of the base and you hold

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.470 
from the bottom of the base and you hold
it<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.060> there<00:02:10.190> see<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it up there see that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.890 
it up there see that
okay<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.280> floor<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.970> they<00:02:16.510> got<00:02:16.750> away

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
okay if this floor and they got away

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.540 
okay if this floor and they got away
with<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.320> because<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.680> base<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.160> kind<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.520> a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
with it because the base is kind of a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.880 
with it because the base is kind of a
darker<00:02:18.910> color<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:20.080> floor<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> darker

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
darker color and the floor is a darker

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.190 
darker color and the floor is a darker
color<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.670> even<00:02:22.000> when<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.300> tight<00:02:22.600> you're

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
color so even when it's tight you're

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.240 
color so even when it's tight you're
gonna<00:02:23.320> you're<00:02:23.710> gonna<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> little

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
gonna you're gonna have a little

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.940 
gonna you're gonna have a little
hairline<00:02:24.790> crack<00:02:25.120> there<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.570> if<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.200> crack<00:02:26.800> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
hairline crack there so if the crack is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
hairline crack there so if the crack is
a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.190> bit<00:02:27.280> bigger<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.730> got<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> slightly

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
a little bit bigger you got a slightly

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.750 
a little bit bigger you got a slightly
more<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.440> crack<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.430> necessarily

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
more of a crack you don't necessarily

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
more of a crack you don't necessarily
see<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.750> when<00:02:31.960> you've<00:02:32.050> got<00:02:32.230> darker<00:02:32.940> base<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
see it when you've got darker base and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.190

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
color something like that that would

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.630 
color something like that that would
stick<00:02:45.220> out<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.670> sore<00:02:45.790> thumb<00:02:46.380> then<00:02:47.640> you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
stick out like a sore thumb then you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.930
