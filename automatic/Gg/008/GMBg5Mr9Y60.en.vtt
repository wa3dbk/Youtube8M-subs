00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.350
 6 wheeled american all-terrain vehicles series 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.930
 max gimmick for Russia and sorry 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.070
 all-terrain vehicle model developed in 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.070
 late sixties 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.320
 for the United States armed forces now regularly 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.020
 serves as hunters and fishermen so 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.090
 claim happy owners 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.070
 all-terrain vehicles max at first glance and 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.200
 I want to call these ATVs 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.960
 a toy but after five minutes 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.329
 dating all-terrain vehicle will allow you more 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 inexperienced host climb steep 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.250
 the hill famously turn around and overclocking 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.260
 enter the water 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.809
 compact and light weight only 350 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.300
 kilogram will allow you to plunge max on 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.059
 ordinary caravan bring it into your 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.950
 favorite places and go untrodden and 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.950
 paths towards the rich 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.130
 you suppose you want to go 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.470
 somewhere hunting or fishing yes or 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.350
 just for mushrooms in the forest means you are on 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.960
 give any jeep to a certain place 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.030
 and then, well, let's assume a month 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.250
 good guys and he will be her little 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.830
 sorry for going somewhere in the swamp in order 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.670
 to drown it did not leave and all-terrain vehicle 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.119
 his magician drove him on a trailer further with 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.070
 trailer under its own power all and free and 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.680
 whether it goes to the towers whether it is there 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.930
 say he doesn't need a forest 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.780
 need some sort of say so specifically 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.420
 the route he just needs to be sent here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.700
 if you get in the way with the trees of the city 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.530
 even necessarily don free bends 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.959
 comes through them goes further 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.090
 so that is here in this area he is in 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.560
 In general, it is also unique in that it does not 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.410
 spoils nature that is, if you talk 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.860
 about those places where there is a reserve or how 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.200
 He there for example on Kamchatka they 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.700
 very much for the tundra are fighting there when he 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.470
 passes on no trace remains on 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.200
 if he goes on the caterpillars wheels she 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.320
 extinguishes all-terrain vehicle will easily make its way through 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.989
 viscous swamp and through a dense forest max 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.880
 very manoeuvrable with a width of only 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.790
 140 centimeters he is capable 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.580
 rotate in place at 360 degrees 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.590
 and easily pass between the trees 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.690
 perfectly calculated trans Russians 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.540
 will allow to reach maximum speed 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.700
 in the glades effective silencer with spark 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.000
 paying off makes the car in the forest 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100
 invisible for 30-40 meters and removable 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.420
 tracks provide easy 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.800
 swamp passability 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.650
 and 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.500
 trash snow here is a caterpillar the same when 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.150
 absolutely all there where no one can 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.580
 go pass here in those cases 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.970
 use caterpillars and in those cases 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.550
 when for example there is very strong dirt there 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.670
 so to speak but not severe swamping 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.290
 terrain 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.890
 that is, it is good enough and somewhere on 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.420
 wheels as for exchange and tracks 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.700
 can remove the caterpillar and one person 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.440
 of course, and for this we are not given much 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.990
 enough time to pull the two wheels 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.030
 front back and become unfold 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.800
 on the site of a caterpillar will do it myself 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.630
 the track value can be put on 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.860
 any model is also still possible 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.800
 put off the oval of snow and brush 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.390
 free territory of some 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.610
 maneuverable max also floats 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.460
 driving up to eight 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.130
 kilometers per hour swims faster than any 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.110
 all-terrain vehicle to swim at the expense of the wheels then 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.480
 he has wheels with aggressive 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.330
 tread and due to this that is 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.580
 when you go to the water that is also 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.040
 the wheels keep spinning and it floats 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.170
 we can say that he and you this all-terrain vehicle 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.660
 magician replaces a small rubber boat with 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.330
 motor you can freely forget on 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.580
 middle of the pond for example a lake or 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.440
 swim across the river or just come from 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.000
 him catch fish on a bath pond 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.130
 Islands will need you to stay on 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.270
 floor in the middle of the pond or swim 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.190
 lakes and fish 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.870
 it can stand up calmly 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.510
 ATV body is made of 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.090
 high impact and ultra light polyethylene 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.880
 and engine power is enough for 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.400
 driving off-road and driving away 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.000
 for a fairly serious load 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.860
 the device is very simple there stands 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.040
 engine engines are 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.790
 two-cylinder v-shaped 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.730
 four stroke power happens to be 16 18-23 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.330
 27 and 29 horsepower engine is very 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.940
 reliable there are models like american 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.830
 bastin stratum japanese kawasaki than they 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.970
 more interesting are these engines are engines 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.970
 interesting because it means they have very 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.890
 low fuel consumption ie tank 19 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.780
 liters enough for continuous work on 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.520
 mean revs mr we speak 10 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.220
 hours that is you will be the whole day 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.620
 ride low tank still you will be so 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.660
 say end is very interesting 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.660
 made exhaust system for the hunter
